Steps:

1. There are two text files with the list of urls "AIPubSumm.txt" and "CSPubSumm.txt". Use them to download the datasets AIPubSumm and CSPubSumm respectively.
2. The process starts with the file data_collection_preprocessing which will take the list of urls, download the files and create 8 csv files AIPubSummIntro.csv, AIPubSummOC.csv, AIPubSummAbstarct.csv, AIPubSummHighlights.csv, CSPubSummIntro.csv, CSPubSummOC.csv, CSPubSummAbstarct.csv and CSPubSummHighlights.csv.
