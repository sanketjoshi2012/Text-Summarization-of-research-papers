s0003687013000549,"  Intensive keyboard use has been associated with an increased risk of developing musculoskeletal symptoms and disorders of the hand, wrist, and arm (Gerr et al., 2002, 2006; Jensen, 2003). Symptoms include pain, tingling, numbness, stiffness and disorders such as carpal tunnel syndrome and tendinitis. The affected tissues include muscle, tendon and tendinous insertions. A review of the physiological evidence suggests that a plausible basis for the pathogenesis of muscle disorders of the upper extremity in low- intensity tasks is sustained motor unit recruitment and homeo- static disturbances coincided with sustained low-intensity muscle activity (Visser and van Dieen, 2006). Sustained low-intensity muscle activity has been associated with adducted and extended wrist postures during keyboard intensive tasks (Dennerlein and Johnson, 2006). These non-neutral wrist postures have been associated with arm/hand symptoms among computer users (Wahlstrom, 2005). Ergonomic guidelines recommend avoiding non-neutral postures during computer work (Hedge and Powers, 1995; Occupational Safety and Health  * Corresponding author.

Despite abundant epidemiologic evidence of association between awkward wrist postures and musculoskeletal symptoms/disorders, little is known about how internal tissue loading is affected by joint posture during computer use. Biomechanically these non-neutral postures can increase in- ternal loading on the muscles and joints. Rempel et al. (2008) re- ported that changes in wrist posture altered carpal tunnel pressure, which may contribute to the development or aggravation of carpal tunnel syndrome (Rempel et al., 1999, 2008). SpeciÔ¨Åcally, wrist deviations in extension or radial deviation while typing are asso- ciated with an increase in pressure. In addition, posture also affects muscle force and activation patterns (Dennerlein et al., 1998b; Visser et al., 2000; Kuo et al., 2006). Computational biomechanical models have been used to estimate muscle/tendon force based on external measures (Chao et al., 1976; Herzog and Leonard, 1991; Dennerlein et al., 1998a; Sancho-Bru et al., 2001) because direct in vivo measurement of internal loading is invasive and technically difÔ¨Åcult. Previous models often investigated Ô¨Ånger and wrist joints separately. It is important to include both the Ô¨Åner and the wrist joints to study keying activities because several muscle-tendon units articulate both Ô¨Ånger and wrist joints. In addition, passive muscle forces contribute to the dynamic motion of the Ô¨Ångers, and therefore cannot be neglected in biomechanical models. However, only a limited number of existing models incor- porated muscle passive properties (Sancho-Bru et al., 2001; Keir and  0003-6870/$ e see front matter √ì 2013 Elsevier Ltd and The Ergonomics Society.

These models use passive Ô¨Ånger muscle properties obtained from cadaveric work (Lee and Rim, 1990; Ranney et al., 1987) which were found to overestimate the passive joint torques measured in experiment (Qin et al., 2010). New data for the passive Ô¨Ånger muscle force assessment parameters have been proposed, which can improve the estimation of muscle force using biome- chanical models of the hand (Qin et al., 2010). The objective of this study is to quantify the effect of wrist posture on resultant hand and forearm muscle stress (including both active and passive component) during tapping on a computer keyboard, using a computational biomechanical model. It is our hypothesis that non-neutral wrist postures increase muscle stress mainly due to increase of passive muscle resistance.  2. "
s0003687013000550,"  Pinch and power grip are essential indicators of hand function (Chaisson et al., 1999; Bagis et al., 2003). Gender, anthropometric factors and occupational loading have been found to affect grip strength which declines with age (Ranganathan et al., 2001a; Angst et al., 2010; Samuel et al., 2012). The impact of occupational hand loading on pinch grip strength is not well understood. Josty et al. (1997) found that heavy manual workers had the highest pinch grip strength, ofÔ¨Åce workers the lowest, and light manual workers were between these two groups. In contrast, a history of manual work with high physical loading may lead to a decrease in hand strength (Russo et al., 2006). To our knowledge, no study has examined the effect of different types of dental work on hand function. Dentists often perform repetitive work tasks with a high de- mand of precision and pinch force. The work tasks in dentistry  * Corresponding author. Tel.: √æ358 30 474 2390; fax: √æ358 30 474 2008. E-mail address: ding.vivien@gmail.com (H. Ding).  differ with respect to mechanical loading on the Ô¨Ånger joints (Milerad et al., 1991; √Ökesson et al., 1997). Dentists heavily utilize the thumb, index, and middle Ô¨Ångers in precision gripping in the right (or dominant) hand, while the left hand remains static for supportive work tasks. Chronic diseases affecting the hand may also lead to decreased pinch grip strength (Carmeli et al., 2003; Bagis et al., 2003). We have reported that symptomatic OA was associated with an increased risk of low pinch grip strength in middle aged women (Ding et al., 2010). A potential role of physical activity in attenuating the loss of grip strength has been suggested (Kjeken, 2011; Klum et al., 2012). A correlation between anthropometric factors and pinch grip strength has been reported. In previous studies, hand length, palm length, and wrist and hand circumference were associated with hand grip strength (Anakwe et al., 2007; Li et al., 2010). A positive correlation was also observed between BMI and hand grip strength among overweight women (Ravisankar et al., 2005). The objective of the present study was to investigate the asso- ciation between variation in dental work task history and pinch grip strength among middle-aged female dentists. We assumed  0003-6870/$ e see front matter √ì 2013 Elsevier Ltd and The Ergonomics Society. All rights reserved. http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2013.03.014  
978  H. Ding et al.  / Applied Ergonomics 44 (2013) 977e981  that low variation in dental work tasks is related to low pinch grip strength independently of symptomatic hand OA. As the right hand is more loaded than the left hand during dental work, we also assumed that the effect of low variation in work tasks on pinch grip strength will be more evident in the right hand than in the left. We further examined whether hand size, BMI and leisure-time hand- related physical activities might confound the potential association.  In the current study, symptomatic hand OA, or jointwise co- occurrence of radiographic Ô¨Åndings and pain, was deÔ¨Åned as fol- lows: the subject had both radiographic Ô¨Åndings (grade  2) and pain (grade  1) in at least one corresponding joint in the 1st (thumb), 2nd (index), or 3rd (middle) Ô¨Ånger or in the wrist. The reference group consisted of subjects without symptomatic hand OA in the Ô¨Årst three Ô¨Ångers or in the wrist.  2. Materials and methods  2.1.  Study samples  The subjects were randomly selected through the registers of the Finnish Dental Association, with aged 45e63 yrs in Helsinki and its neighbouring cities. Of those who received the questionnaire (in 2002), 295 (67.7%) dentists participated in a clinical examination between October 2002 and March 2003. Participation in the study was voluntary and based on informed consent. The Hospital District of Helsinki and Uusimaa Ethics Committee for Research in Occu- pational Health and Safety approved the study proposal.  2.2.  Pinch grip strength  Tripoid pinch grip strength (later: pinch strength) of both hands was measured between the pulp of the thumb in opposition to the pulps of the index and middle Ô¨Ångers, using the Martin Vig- orimeter√í with a small ball. The Martin Vigorimeter is one of the instruments frequently used to assess grip strength in clinical and research settings (Mathiowetz et al., 1985; Hamilton et al., 1994; Haidar et al., 2004) The Vigorimeter showed good validity and reliability (Jones et al., 1991; Desrosiers et al., 1995). The test was administered during the clinical examination ses- sion by a researcher trained for the purpose. The measurement was performed Ô¨Årst on the right and then the left hand. The subjects were seated in a chair with back support, feet on the Ô¨Çoor, and hands on the table in a neutral position. The elbow of the hand to be tested was Ô¨Åxed at 90 . The subjects received a verbal instruction to squeeze the ball as hard as they can. Subjects were asked to make two maximal contractions. If the second contraction was more than 10% higher or lower than the Ô¨Årst, a third contraction was made. The highest reading was taken to represent the subject‚Äôs pinch strength. The unit of measurement was kilopascal (kPa). The lower 25th percentile of pinch grip strength (52 kPa) was used as the cut-off point to deÔ¨Åne low pinch strength of the left and the right hand. The great majority of the subjects were right-handed (eight per- sons, or 2.7%, were left-handed).  2.3. DeÔ¨Ånition of symptomatic hand OA  Both hands of the participants were radiographed. The analogue radiographs were evaluated by an experienced radiologist who was blinded to the age, and all health data of the subjects. Each distal interhalangeal (DIP), proximal interphalangeal (PIP), thumb inter- phalangeal (IP), and metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joint of both hands, and the wrists as a unit, were graded separately using a modiÔ¨Åed Kellgren and Lawrence scoring system with reference images (grade 0 ¬º no OA; ., grade 4 ¬º severe OA). The weighted intra-observer Kappa-coefÔ¨Åcients of the readings varied from 0.59 to 1.00 indicating good reliability (Solovieva et al., 2005). Information on pain in each joint was collected by a self- administered questionnaire, with the question: ‚ÄúPlease point out in the picture below, in which Ô¨Ånger joint did you feel pain or tenderness during the past 30 days‚Äù? The subject graded the joints with pain from 0 ¬º never to 3 ¬º severe on a Ô¨Ågure of the hands.  2.4. Dental work history assessment  Based on a panel discussion with three experienced dentists and a professor in odontology, the main tasks in dentistry were listed and ranked by decade from the 1960s onwards, with respect to (0 ¬º no load, ., 10 ¬º maximum load). loading on the hands Changes in working techniques and instruments were also considered. Six main tasks in dental work were identiÔ¨Åed: (1) restorative treatment and endodontics, (2) orthodontics, (3) peri- odontics, (4) prosthodontics, (5) surgical treatment, and (6) other non-treatment activities (e.g. dental examination, consulting, and administrative tasks). Information on dentist‚Äôs work history was collected by ques- tionnaires and checked by interview during clinical examination. The study participants were asked to recall their work history in 10- year periods (at the ages of 25e34, 35e44, and 45e54 yrs) in terms of average number of working hours per week, and the proportion of time (percentage) they performed each task during an average working day. A matrix of workload coefÔ¨Åcients for different tasks and time periods has been reported previously (Vehmas et al., 2005). Dental Ô¨Ålling and root treatment was ranked as highest loading task among all dental work tasks. Based on the weekly hours of work tasks 1e5, the pattern of tasks during work history was empirically determined by cluster analysis. Three clusters were identiÔ¨Åed: 1) low variation: the den- tists who had spent most of their work time on restoration  Table 1 Distribution of subject of characteristics by the level of variation in dental work tasks.

Other risk factors  During the clinical examination session, weight was measured (without shoes) to an accuracy of 0.1 kg. Body mass index (BMI) was calculated based on self-reported height and measured weight. Information on weekly hours of hand-loading leisure-time activ- ities and glove size was collected by a self-administered question- naire. The customary glove size, graded as small, medium or large,  was used as proxy for hand size. The hand-loading leisure-time activities were categorized into two groups using cluster analysis with the K-means algorithm. The majority of the subjects were classiÔ¨Åed into the low-level hand-loading leisure-time activity group (N ¬º 390, 72%), while 28% of the women had high-level hand-loading leisure-time activity.  2.6.  Statistical analysis  The differences in pinch grip strength between left and right hand by the level of variation in dental tasks and age groups were analysed applying generalized linear model with a repeated mea- sures design.

Odds ratios (ORs) and their 95% conÔ¨Ådence intervals (CIs) were adjusted for BMI, hand size, and hand-loading leisure-time activity. The analyses were performed with the SPSS (version 14.0 program).  3. Results  The distribution of subject characteristics by the level of varia- tion in dental work tasks is presented in Table 1. Dentists with a history of high work task variation were somewhat younger than those with less variation in their work task history (p ¬º 0.02). The groups did not differ with respect to other assessed characteristics. The prevalence of symptomatic OA in the joints of the Ô¨Årst three Ô¨Ångers or the wrist was higher in the right hand than in the left hand (right vs. left: 10.9% vs. 8.2%, P < 0.001). Pinch grip strength decreased with age in both hands and with decreasing level of variation in work tasks in the right hand (Fig. 1). Among the dentists aged 45e54 years, the pinch grip strength in the left hand was lower than that in the right hand independent of variation in work tasks, but among the older age group (55e63- years), a similar pattern was observed only in those who had per- formed variable work tasks.  3.1. Variation of work tasks in working history and pinch grip strength  We examined the association of variation in dental work task history with pinch grip strength separately by hand (Table 2). In unadjusted analyses regarding the right hand, the dentists with low (OR 2.67, 95% CI 1.43e4.99) and moderate (2.11, 1.01e4.40), varia- tion in work tasks had a higher risk of low pinch grip strength compared with those who had performed variable work tasks. Including age and symptomatic hand OA in the model attenuated the association between moderate task variation and low pinch grip strength, but the association of low task variation with low pinch grip strength persisted. Further adjustment for other cova- riates (body mass index, hand size and hand-loading leisure-time activity) had little effect on the estimates. In the left hand, no as- sociation between the variation in work task history and low pinch grip strength was observed.  4. Discussion  The functional integrity of the human hand comprises adequate pinch grip strength, which is needed in dealing with the demands of hand use in daily life and in many occupational activities. OA- related impairment in grip force production has been shown to lead to a decline in hand function while performing tasks that require using a power or precision grip (Stamm et al., 2002). We found among middle-aged female dentists that low varia- tion in dental work history, with tasks predominantly in restoration treatment and endodontics, was associated with low pinch grip strength in the right hand independent of age and symptomatic OA. No such relationship was observed in the left hand. We repeated the analyses excluding the left-handed subjects, but the results remained the same. This may be because of the low number of left- handed dentists in our study group (2.7%). Our Ô¨Åndings are in line with previous studies which showed that a long history of repetitive manual work was associated with impaired hand function (Young et al., 1995; Russo et al., 2006). The effect of physical workload in dentistry on the occurrence of hand/ wrist problems has been investigated (Alexopoulos et al., 2004; Solovieva et al., 2006; Dong et al., 2007). In the present study material, low variation in dental work task history was related to OA in the joints of the thumb, index, and middle Ô¨Ångers (Solovieva  et al., 2006). We have also reported that symptomatic hand OA increased the risk of low pinch grip strength (Ding et al., 2010). The results of the current study suggest that the level of variation in dental work tasks affects pinch grip strength both directly and indirectly via symptomatic OA. It is known that the loss of hand function is associated with age (Carmeli et al., 2003). Even though reduced pinch grip strength is an inevitable consequence of ageing, skilled Ô¨Ånger exercise can improve hand function in older persons (Ranganathan et al., 2001b) and in those with OA (Kjeken, 2011). The effect of hand usage at work on hand function is likely also more complex, since both under use and overuse of the hand joints have been associated with a decline in hand strength (Parlitz et al., 1998; IJmker et al., 2007). Traditionally dentists performing clinical procedures use their working hand, most frequently the right hand, to rotate hand pieces and other hand instruments, having a mirror in the left hand for facilitating vision to the working site or for retraction of oral soft tissues. Stereotyped repetitive dental tasks for prolonged periods may lead to overuse of the thumb, index Ô¨Ånger, and middle Ô¨Ånger, and may consequently increase the risk of right hand function impairment in dentists with low variation in work tasks. In accor- dance with this we observed that the age-related decline in the pinch grip strength of the right hand was steeper among dentists with low variation in work tasks than among dentists with high variation. The decline was so marked that in the older group of dentists aged 55e63 years, pinch grip strength in the right hand was lower than that in the left among those who had had moderate or low work task variation. It is also possible that there was a training element in the use of the left hand among dentists with moderate and low task variation. Thus, our Ô¨Ånding suggests that hand overuse may accelerate the decline in hand function with age, while appropriate hand loading activity may counteract the age changes in pinch grip strength and might even improve hand function. In the current study, the level of variation in dental work tasks was empirically deÔ¨Åned based on detailed self-reported informa- tion about dentists‚Äô work history. In such a situation some recall bias may be induced particularly when work history is long. Although we lack speciÔ¨Åc information on the reliability of this assessment, we assume that well-educated middle-aged women, most of whom were still actively working in the Ô¨Åeld, recalled their work history adequately enough for our purposes, where the overall variation in work tasks was described by three categories. We deÔ¨Åned low pinch grip strength based on its distribution in the material, and its signiÔ¨Åcance for e.g. managing dental work tasks should be addressed in future studies. We used the jointwise co-occurrence of radiological Ô¨Åndings and pain to deÔ¨Åne symptomatic hand OA. This was done to imitate, in an epidemiological setting of a random sample of dentists, the clinical disease where both symptoms and Ô¨Åndings are relevant. In our previous study (Ding et al., 2010) we found that symptomatic radiographic OA, but not radiographic Ô¨Åndings or symptoms alone, was associated with decreased pinch grip strength. In conclusion, we found that the dentists with the most hand- loading tasks were at an increased risk of low pinch grip strength, independent of hand OA. This draws attention to work arrangements that could counteract deterioration of hand function, as adequate hand function is a prerequisite for continued occupa- tion as a dentist. The dentists with low variation in work tasks need to modify their work practices and if possible, to perform diversity of work tasks in order to reduce the risk of developing hand disability. Since work-related musculoskeletal problems and loss of hand function may lead to absence from work and even early retirement among the dentists (Burke et al., 1997), learning work ergonomics already during their undergraduate clinical training is to be recommended.

s0003687013000562,"  Drives to reduce the number of accidents which happen to young children represent a major challenge for safety organisations and governments around the world. Every year within the UK one million children under the age of 15 experience accidents of varying degrees of severity in or around their home environments (RoSPA, 2012). Those most at risk from a home accident are children be- tween the ages of 0e4 years (UK Consumer Safety Unit, 2002). A signiÔ¨Åcant number of minor injuries occur in a number of other contexts involving young children (e.g., rail travel e RSSB, 2009). One way of reducing the number of these accidents is the design of warning signs and other types of visual information which can alert young children and their carers to the dangers or hazards involved in hazardous environments or potentially unsafe behaviours. Our aim in this paper is to outline our attempts to work towards a set of guidelines for the design and evaluation of warning signs for young children. In this paper we refer to ‚Äòyoung children‚Äô as chil- dren between the ages of 5 and 11 years of age. The work draws on the previous Ô¨Åndings of Waterson et al.

In what follows, we Ô¨Årst review previous research which has examined the design and evaluation of warning signs for young children, along- side work addressing the types of methods which have been used to carry out research with children under the age of 11.  1.1.  The design of visual warning signs for young children  Very few guidelines or standards for the design of warning signs and other materials exist for the children under the age of 11 years (Waterson et al., 2012). This stands in contrast to information of this kind which is available for adults (e.g., BSI, 2002; ANSI, 1998), as well as guidance developed for speciÔ¨Åc groups of individuals (e.g., visually impaired and other types of disabled users e Barker and Fraser, 2000). A key lesson from the available literature is that because of the limited cognitive abilities of children, particularly the very young, warnings need to be designed very differently as compared to those targeted at adults (Rice Berg and Lueder, 2008). Kashler and Wogalter (2008) suggest that some aspects of guide- lines aimed at adult populations can be adopted for use with younger children, these include: the need to make warning ‚Äòstand out‚Äô (e.g., using bright colours and contrasts); and the use of pictorial symbols (e.g., pictograms).  0003-6870/$ e see front matter √ì 2013 Elsevier Ltd and The Ergonomics Society.

(2012) carried out a study in collaboration with the UK Rail Safety and Standards Board (RSSB), the aim of which was to develop an outline set of guidelines covering the design and evaluation of warning signs (Table 1 shows a summary of the guidelines as they relate to design). The guidelines were based on a set of classroom discussions with groups of children aged between 5 and 11. One of the conclusions from this work was the need to carry out further evaluation of the guidelines in order to gain feedback regarding their content from a range of different groups. The primary objective of the current study was to evaluate the guidelines with a range of human factors experts, parents of young children, teachers and professional book illustrators and authors.  discussion sessions held with children in their classrooms and facilitated by the researchers and teachers. The aim of the current study is to Ô¨Årm up the guidelines by drawing on the opinions of a wider range of people (e.g., human factors experts, parents and children‚Äôs book illustrators). A second objective was to develop a revised set of guidelines which could be used by designers to develop new signs and later evaluated and tested with children and other groups (e.g., parents, teachers).  2.

s0003687013000574,"  Meat cutters face higher risks of injury and musculoskeletal problems than most other occupational groups. The aims of this paper were to describe ergonomics changes implemented in three meat cutting plants and to evaluate effects related to ergonomics on the individual meat cutters and their work. Data was collected by interviews, observations, document studies and a questionnaire (n ¬º 247), as a post intervention study. The changes implemented consisted of reducing knife work to a maximum of 6 h per day and introducing a job rotation scheme with work periods of equal length. Tasks other than traditional meat cutting were added. A competence development plan for each meat cutter and easy adjustment of workplace height were introduced. The questionnaire showed a reduction in perceived physical work load. In general, the changes were perceived positively. Figures from the company showed a positive trend for injuries and sick leave.  √ì 2013 Elsevier Ltd and The Ergonomics Society. All rights reserved.  Meat cutting work imposes increased risks for accidents and occupational diseases, e.g. due to musculoskeletal disorders (MSD) and cutting injuries (Lindbeck and Engkvist, 2008; Vogel et al., 2010). Several studies have conÔ¨Årmed that work related MSDs are multifaceted and have many contributing causes, also among meat cutters (Johansson et al., 2010; Karsh et al., 2001; National Research Council and The Institute of Medicine, 2001; NIOSH, 1997; Tappin et al., 2008). A combination of technical and other measures are considered more effective than one measure in controlling risk (Karsh et al., 2001). Intervention studies have conÔ¨Årmed that improvement effects can be seen, not only on MSD symptoms and absence, but also on proÔ¨Åtability (Moore and Garg, 1998; Yeow and Nath Sen, 2006). When involving staff in partic- ipative improvement work, results were better, although every workplace must consider their context and their needs, tasks and employees (Caroly et al., 2007; Norman and Wells, 1998; van Eerd et al., 2010). Hansson et al. (2009, 2010) have shown high wrist velocity and force demands, established risk factors for MSD, be present in meat  * Corresponding author.

The knife, being the meat cutters‚Äô main and often only tool, is a source of both ac- cidents and disorders (Blom, 2008; Fogleman et al., 1993; Szabo et al., 2001).  1.1.  The industrial context  In 2007, 7411 individuals were employed in the Swedish Cattle Slaughter and Meat Cutting industry. The meat industry in Sweden has however, low proÔ¨Åtability. Moreover, many companies have difÔ¨Åculties in recruiting meat cutters, although skilled meat cut- ters in Sweden have relatively high status and salaries in the companies. The meat industry thus increasingly chose to rely on meat cutters coming from employment agencies. In several per- sonal communications with the CEO, Swedish Meat Industry As- sociation (2009e2011) he expressed concern about the competitiveness of the Swedish meat industry. This is also veriÔ¨Åed by several industry stakeholders (Jordbruksverket, 2011; Wikstr√∂m, 2011). Between the years 2005e2007 the industry reported 940 in- juries (666 occupational accidents with absence and 274 occu- pational diseases). Meat cutters account for 29% of the 1409 reported injuries. Most of the accidents were related to knife handling, mainly amongst meat cutters and slaughterers.

To improve health and safety among meat cutters, in 2007 the Swedish Work Environment Authority (AV) made demands on the largest meat cutting companies, which had more than 3/ 4 of the Swedish meat cutting market, to reduce the risk of occupational accidents and work related diseases for meat cutters. The companies were to meet the requirements by December 31, 2008. The requirements were as follows (directly translated):  1. A work period shall be a maximum of 1.5 h between breaks and work using knives should be limited to 6 h per day. Break length should be adapted to the shift length (short work pe- riods e short breaks, longer work periods e longer breaks). Production Ô¨Çow rate should be capped and an even work load must be ensured for the whole day. 2. Technical improvements that eliminate heavy lifting shall be implemented. 3. The temperature in the workplace must not fall below √æ12  C. 4. There must be routines to deal with the problem of ‚Äúhard pigs‚Äù (crystallized fat). 5. All meat cutters must be offered annual medical examinations for work-related symptoms. Independent expertise must be employed to ensure that the requirements are met (The Swedish Work Environment Authority, 2007).  6.  2. Material and methods  2.1.  The company  The study was performed in one of Sweden‚Äôs largest food pro- cessing companies (3000 employees), and the largest in slaugh- tering and meat cutting, which accounts for 60% of the Swedish meat industry. The company had been one of the few in the Swedish food industry, and to our knowledge the only in meat cutting, that prior to this study had been part of research pro- grammes in order to achieve better working conditions for their employees (H√§gg and Vogel, 2003, H√§gg et al., 2007). It had three meat cutting plants that were all included in this study, and each plant was a separate unit within the company. When the study was undertaken, one plant (B) cut beef in one department during the day and night shift. The second plant (B&P) cut both beef and pork in four departments on both day and night shifts. The third plant (P) cut pork in three departments, one of which also worked night shift.  2.2. Observations  Different aspects of the working environment, such as work- place and production layout, manual lifting, and work pace were observed and noted during the visits at each plant. Discussion and clariÔ¨Åcation of problems were made with relevant occupational categories on all levels.  1.2.  The interactive research programme  2.3. Questionnaire  The Swedish meat cutting industry and union jointly contacted the authors of this paper for collaboration. This resulted in a four year interactive research and development programme with the dual purpose of reducing MSDs and accidents among Swedish meat cutters and also to improve company performance. The researchers had a pre-understanding of the industry and its culture and risks, based on in-depth interviews of staff on different levels as well as literature studies (Karltun, 2008, 2010; Karltun et al., 2011, 2008; Lindbeck and Engkvist, 2008; Vogel et al., 2010). Beyond this, Vogel had eight years of experience as a meat cutter, is a trained ergon- omist and had fourteen years as an ergonomics consultant within the meat cutting business and experience from a previous research project (H√§gg et al., 2007). The present study was part of this programme. To meet the demands from the authorities, the case-company undertook a company-wide programme to develop and implement changes. The changes were intended as a radical improvement in the orga- nization of meat cutting, both in the content of meat cutters‚Äô daily work and in their physical work load. The researchers were then offered the opportunity to evaluate the results of the programme. The other companies were not evaluated due to time and resource constraints. The case-company was considered to offer the best opportunities for evaluation.  1.3. Aim  The aim of this paper was threefold:  1. To describe the changes implemented in the case company. 2. To assess the effects on the individual meat cutter and his/her work from an ergonomics perspective. These effects included changes in perceptions of physical and mental demands, safety issues, workplace design and qualiÔ¨Åcation demands. 3. To assess effects for the organization.  A questionnaire was developed, comprising of 7 background, 15 multiple-choice and 3 open questions concerning advantages, shortcomings and any comments (Wikman, 1991). Of the multiple- choice questions, three concerned attitudes to the new organiza- tion, four concerned physical and mental work load and the rest compared the old work organization with the new one regarding aspects, such as pauses, work pace, accidents and workplace design. The questions used to assess physical and mental exertion were previously used by Engkvist (Engkvist, 2006, 2010).  2.3.1.  Respondents  All meat cutters (100%) present on the day that the question- naires were distributed had the opportunity to answer the ques- tionnaire. There was no active drop-out, i.e. all meat cutters present answered the questionnaire. Those sick, on parental leave or on vacation were thereby excluded. The number of respondents from each plant is indicated in Table 1. Temporary meat cutters from employment agencies at company had to be excluded due to language problems  the and  Table 1 Description of participants. Mean Ô¨Ågures and range (within brackets).

It was estimated that the total number of temporary workers was approximately 100 persons (24% of all meat cutters at the company), distributed according to the size of the plants.  2.3.2. Questionnaire collection  The plants were visited in December 2008 (B) and June 2009 (B&P and P) respectively, three to six months after implementation. The questionnaires were distributed and collected during a break, provided and paid for by the company. There were opportunities to ask the researchers present for clariÔ¨Åcation when Ô¨Ålling in the questionnaire.  2.3.3. Data analysis of  the questionnaire  The multiple-choice questions were analysed using descriptive statistics, correlations between possible related answers and sta- tistical tests. The descriptive assessment was performed using MSOfÔ¨Åce Excel 2007. The statistical calculations were made using the PASW Statistics 18 (SPSS Statistics 18). Mean values were tested for statistical signiÔ¨Åcance with an independent sample t-test at the 95% signiÔ¨Åcance level. Cross tables were tested for signiÔ¨Åcance with Pearson‚Äôs square test. The answers to the open questions were analysed concerning their content and themes were identiÔ¨Åed. The numbers of similar comments were counted concerning each question and each department or plant. Secondly the answers were added to an aggregated level concerning the whole company.  carry it a few steps from the conveyor, up (5e6 cm) on the standing platform and place the meat on the table in front of the line. The same method and weights applied to the fore shank and brisket. Platforms were difÔ¨Åcult to adjust. The pork cutting department of B&P consisted of three pace lines, for ham, side and shoulder. This work was fragmented into opera- tions of less than 30 s and conducted at continuously moving conveyor belts. Work height could be adjusted and there was little lifting. A few single tables where meat cutters cut whole carcasses or large chunks were still used and many of the meat cutters had knowledge of working on the whole carcass. At single tables, manual handling and lifting weights of w10 kg was frequent. On the night shift, where work was similar to the day shift, mainly temporary agency meat cutters worked. Moreover, there was a skinning department for manually and semi-automatically de-fattening ham, cutting and packing. Here work was faster and lifting was sparse. At the P plant, three departments were specialized in cutting one part of the pig each; shoulder, middle part and ham, but one night shift cutting all parts. The production method was a mix of pace line and separate tables where some meat cutters biweekly worked either method. Most meat cutters worked at the pace line where working conditions were similar to the pork cutting department of B&P. Thus work load for beef cutters were highest at the B&P plant, and beef cutters as a whole had higher work load than pork cutters. In all plants and departments, pressurised puriÔ¨Åed air was blown into the membranes to separate the muscles before cutting.  2.4.  Interviews  3.2.  Changes implemented  All nine meat cutters‚Äô supervisors were interviewed on their roles as supervisors and the performance of the change process. The interviews were semi-structured and followed the same structure as the meat cutters‚Äô questionnaire. Notes were taken and structured in themes. Similarities and differences, pluses and mi- nuses, were identiÔ¨Åed and categorised.  2.5. Document compilation  The company‚Äôs annual reports for 2007e2011 were examined and company statistics on sick leave and on occupational injuries were compiled for the period 2007e2011.  3. Results  3.1. Observations  3.1.1. Meat cutting before change  There were some organizational and work load differences be- tween the plants. At B&P, the beef cutting department had imple- mented a major change in working practices, as single table production was exchanged to a Ô¨Çow line with deboning in two stages to improve both work environment and production. First, 2e 3 meat cutters cut the quarter carcass (w80 kg), letting chunks (w15 kg) fall down to a conveyor belt. Next, the other cutters had the chunks fall on their cutting table, in random order. This was mainly a non-lifting task. The chunks were separated and sorted into for example bone, fat and sirloin. Platforms were individually adjustable for optimal working height. In B, meat cutting was conducted along a line, where all meat cutters performed all tasks. Quarters were cut down in two stages, but with manual and in some workplaces heavy handling. Quarters were cut hanging from a conveyor where working height was not adjustable. One heavy task was cutting off the whole loin section including the bone, approximately 20 kg, lift it with one hand and  All plants experienced similar change processes in how their steering committees were set with representatives from manage- ment, trade union, safety representatives and sometimes from the local occupational health services (OHS). There were plant-speciÔ¨Åc committees and an overall company project steering committee. A large number of meetings were held until consensus was obtained. The work started in October 2008 for the plants, except for B, where the work started earlier, and where the changes were implemented in September 2008. Both B&P and P managed to implement the changes before the deadline in December 2008.  3.2.1.  Rotation and enlargement  In order to reduce the knife work to a maximum of 6 h per day, a rotation scheme was introduced. Work periods of 65e75 min were organised with pauses and breaks of 15e35 min for food. The longer the work period, the longer the pause. The work stations included were those originally performed by the meat cutters. The additional tasks for rotation were mostly among the meat packers, such as skinning details at skinning machines, and packing at different vacuum packaging machines. These tasks involved handling and lifting meat details of smaller weights and with varied movement patterns. These tasks were mainly demanding low skill; others were controlling functions that were physically non- demanding. The result meant job enlargement within the depart- ment to tasks additional to meat cutting. For the individual, this meant Ô¨Åve work periods a day, one of which was without using a knife. To manage the rotation scheme, a personal competence development plan was set up for each meat cutter. This, together with monitoring quality, was updated at least once a year.  3.2.2. Other demands  Other demands from the AV were addressed in the company‚Äôs Safety Committees (SCs): A yearly medical examination was put into operation, based on the recommendations by Ohlsson et al. (1994) and performed by physiotherapists at each plant‚Äôs OHS.

It was closely monitored by the engineering department of the company, to ensure that temperature didn‚Äôt fall below √æ12  C and to certify that routines for crystallized fat were followed. Independent expertise in the form of local OHS was employed in all plants to ensure that the requirements were met. They reported to the company‚Äôs SC.  3.3. Meat cutter population  The meat cutters employed in the three plants participated in this study, see Table 1. Most meat cutters were men. All but two women were found in workplaces with physically less demanding handling and lifting tasks such as skinning and ham deboning. The age distribution was fairly even but with some over- representation of younger (<32 years) cutters, and cutters around 50 years being underrepresented. The meat cutters were in general experienced. In B all but one, in B&P all but four and in P all were fully experienced (one year ac- cording to H√§kk√§nen et al. (2001) and Madeleine and Madsen (2009)).  3.4. Meat cutters‚Äô experiences of  the changes  3.4.1.  Physical and mental exertion and tiredness  In all three plants, less tiredness was experienced after the change (Table 2). The improvement in perceived physical tiredness, compared to the old way of working was signiÔ¨Åcant. At P, the perceived improvement was less than at the other plants. Those working at B rated more tiredness, both physically and mentally, than the others. Meat cutters at P were signiÔ¨Åcantly less tired compared to B (Table 3). All perceived more physical than mental tiredness.  3.4.2.  Breaks  There was a considerable difference between the plants regarding perception of rest during breaks. The meat cutters of B&P (Table 2) perceived signiÔ¨Åcantly better rest at breaks than the meat cutters of the two other plants.  3.4.3. Design of work stations and competence  Many meat cutters worked frequently at work stations not suited for their body height. Between 35 and 69% did this at least sometimes (Fig. 1). Here, comments were on negative stress as working in an appropriate working height was troublesome.

Whether rotation meant working on tasks they found difÔ¨Åcult (Fig. 3), in all plants between 3 and 36% often or sometimes per- cieved difÔ¨Åculties in coping with their new tasks. At B, most of the meat cutters (68%) and in B&P 66% experienced no problems. Safety. At B and at P, a large majority perceived the accident risks un- changed. In B&P 50% saw it as unchanged (Fig. 4). In the comments, the responses referred to negative stress.  3.4.4. Other effects of  the changes  In total, 71e75% gave an answer to these questions. Of those who answered, most perceived their work as remaining un- changed. About 40% did not perceive any change in the use of their skill. The support and help from, and cooperation and contact with workmates showed the same Ô¨Ågures. After the changes 50% perceived the same support and help from their supervisors as before. Variation in work was more or less the same: 29% did not perceive a change while 20% had more monotonous and 21% more varied work. On a question of meaningfulness, 40% saw no change while 21% perceived less meaning and 10% more meaningfulness in their work. Regarding freedom at work, 39% saw less freedom and 24% saw a worsening of conditions. On the question of whether still working for the company in three years, 40% answered yes and 7% no, while 25% did not know. For 48% of them, the changes had not affected their willingness to work as a meat cutter. For 14% willingness had decreased and for 8% it had increased.  3.5.

Most of their responses were positive (54%). Almost as many, 77% gave their opinion from B&P, and from P 68% took the opportunity to give their view on the changes. There were a total of 384 opinions and suggestions, 57% of which were positive and 38% negative. A t-test showed a signiÔ¨Åcantly larger number (<0.001) of positive answers from plant B. The Ô¨Ågures for the two other plants were not signif- icant. Opinions given were to a certain extent identical. There were many comments on the physical side of the work. Variation and diversity, as well as being less physically strenuous, were experi- enced as positive outcomes of the new way of working. Comments such as ‚ÄúYou do not get as tired (physically)‚Äù (81 comments), were typical. On the negative side, most focused on the speed and pace of work, such as: ‚ÄúI lose my Ô¨Çow when I have to change position‚Äù (22 comments). As can be seen from Table 4, a number of meat cutters did not perceive any change (20 comments).  3.6.  Interviews  The supervisors described the change process and the decisions as anchored in a democratic process with groups of employees and the union. They considered the rotation positive as the work load on the individuals was more even and the physical load decreased, resulting in less pain. Rotation had increased competence in the departments. For production, there was a ramp up period with some practical difÔ¨Åculties, eventually solved. The result was a more  Fig. 3.

Document compilation  The results from Table 5 indicate an overall trend in which occupational injuries and sick leave are reduced during the years following the intervention.  4. Discussion  4.1. Material and methods  The questionnaire had a good response rate and nobody actively refrained from answering. As 68e89% took the opportunity to ex- press a personal opinion in their own words, this indicates a pro- found interest in answering the questionnaire. Several studies have examined the validity of recall, there seems to be substantial forgetfulness over time, where six months seems to be the limit for accurate remembrance, although some studies found good re- membrance correlated to the importance of the events and a large variation between individuals (Conway et al., 1994; Jenkins et al., 1979; Litwin and McGuigan, 1999; Must et al., 2002). The periods between change and the questionnaire were in this case less than six months. In the questionnaire, the question ‚ÄúWhy do you not change the height‚Äù lacked the alternative ‚ÄúCannot be done‚Äù, which was added by seven meat cutters. From the observations, it was considered  Table 4 Opinions of and number of comments on the changes.

As the alternative was stated, it can be assumed that some meat cutters found the difÔ¨Åculties too great. Consequently we cannot know if more meat cutters would have chosen that alternative, had it been available.  4.1.1.  Limitations  To assess change in retrospect has its limitations. This is a post intervention study and lacks a baseline. Due to the realities of our research conditions this solution was the only option available as the change process and some changes had started before the research project was launched. The questions were however formulated in such a way as to facilitate comparisons before and after the changes.  4.2. Observations  4.2.1. Meat cutting  The company had several plants that functioned autonomously, which means that the company could gain from using best-practice from the different plants (O‚ÄôDell and Grayson, 1998). This means Ô¨Ånding out what equipment and organization provides the best trade-off between good ergonomics and good proÔ¨Åt and spreading that (Falck et al., 2010). The company planned for implementing a non-lifting method as in P&B in B. This would be according to the demands of the AV. To encourage workers to Ô¨Ånd solutions to their own problems may be a faster way to improve conditions than relying on external expertise alone. There are many workplaces that need no further investigation, but actions regarding height adjustments and manual handling. There was a major difference between B and B&P in how meat was cut: In B work was conducted along a line where each meat cutter stood on platforms of poor design, sloping and very difÔ¨Åcult to adjust the height, once it was done. The rotation demanded height adjustment, but if the meat cutter refrained from that due to dif- Ô¨Åculties, that might lead to discomfort. Work was heavy and per- formed according to common practice in the Swedish business. The meat cutters were however free to move, interact and speak with their workmates. At B&P‚Äôs beef cutting department, work was less physically demanding as most lifting tasks were eliminated. In that depart- ment, height adjustments were easily done on good quality plat- forms. Each meat cutter was however more isolated as little cooperation was needed during work. Moreover, the design of the mechanical equipment hindered personal communication. The system provided instead computerized monitoring of and feedback on each meat cutter‚Äôs work. In one plant, some meat cutters worked bi-weekly on pace line and individual tables. The company could beneÔ¨Åt by reviewing the advantages of each method in its plant context (Johansson et al., 2010; Karltun et al., 2011).  4.2.2.  Rotation and enlargement  The rotation was a means to meet the AVs demands. To further enhance the beneÔ¨Åts, meet the negative comments and to ensure a  smooth rotation, the company could include the meat packers and train those interested into meat cutters. To achieve this, the company has to put effort in the multi-skilling of all workers and have them understand the importance and potential of the rotation. With all workers multi-skilled, the company‚Äôs vulnerability to absenteeism would be reduced (Eklund, 1995).  4.2.3.  Changes implemented  Four of the six demands from the AV did not affect the meat cutters daily work: independent expertise, medical examinations, temperature and crystallized fat, aimed at improving working conditions in the longer term. Thus, these demands are judged to be mainly of an administrative character and thus have minor inÔ¨Çuence on the outcomes since these were addressed within one year. The rotation meant a signiÔ¨Åcant broadening in work content. From being solely a meat cutter, they were now also packers and pre-cutters. Even more, some meat cutters being specialized in cutting one part had to learn or re-learn cutting tasks. This involved broadening the tasks for supervisors as well, to manage rotation schemes, competence plans and teaching meat cutters their new tasks. Developing a schedule for the rotation that takes into account the needs of the meat cutter not to lose Ô¨Çow in work and maximise the effects of rotation was considered advantageous. How the changes affected the rest of the employees was not an issue for this paper. The addition of less demanding tasks in the rotation scheme, however, led to some personnel who were unable to perform meat cutting tasks being laid off. When employees vary their tasks, move between machines and tools and change tasks with one another, risk of accidents could increase as in shift work (Wong et al., 2011). This was not viewed as a major problem by the meat cutters. An interesting possibility may be pooling experiences (Vogel, 2008) from the different project committees, to disseminate best practice throughout the company. The changes represented a broad view on ergonomics; not only physical changes, but a view on working conditions, which at its best will optimize human well-being and system performance (IEA, 2000). The process being conducted in a participatory way was perceived as positive. As Busck, Knudsen & Lind argue in two ar- ticles (2010; 2011), participation contributes both to company success and quality of work environment.  4.2.4.  Effects on meat cutters  The results concerning physical and mental exertion for meat cutters (N ¬º 247; 89% men) were compared with a previous study where identical questions were asked at recycling centres (N ¬º 122; 90% men). Workers at recycling centres showed physical exertion 4.4 and meat cutters 5.0, mental exertion at recycling centres 4.4 and meat cutters 4.4 (Engkvist, 2010). This comparison indicates that meat cutting is more physically demanding work but that the mental demands are more equal regarding those workplaces. Ac- cording to Volkoff et al. (2010), employees in their Ô¨Åfties have problems in work under time pressure. In our study no cutter was older than 62 years old, indicating that meat cutters do not reach retirement age (65 years in Sweden) as meat cutters. Moreover, the inclusion of less physically demanding workplaces in the rotation scheme meant that these workplaces were not available as ‚Äúclose- to-retirement‚Äù positions as before. This was commented on by su- pervisors saying things like ‚ÄúFrom now on, it will not be easy to get old in this company‚Äù. Given time, there are expectations in the group of supervisors, that the improved working conditions will reduce MSDs and improve the ability to work until retirement age. They claimed that when fewer are injured, the need for physically easier  Please cite this article in press as: Vogel, K., et al., Improving meat cutters‚Äô work: Changes and effects following an intervention, Applied Ergonomics (2013), http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2013.03.016

There were problems in acquiring correct working height, espe- cially in B. The workplace platforms were heavy and difÔ¨Åcult to move, uneven and often sloping. There was a considerable difference from B&P, where most platforms were of better quality and easy to change. Our observations thus correspond with the questionnaire results. Moreover, a new plan for maintenance and order keeping of the work stations were to be introduced since the private workplaces disappeared with the rotation and with this, also the will to maintain your own workplace. This was commented on in the open answers as a perceived problem. Rotation meant a more even distribution of working time and breaks and doing other tasks than before. When giving open an- swers, some wrote that changing tasks made them loose Ô¨Çow. Other answers dealt with the difÔ¨Åculties in changing from the safe and well known specialized job to unfamiliar tasks both in meat cutting and other tasks. The issues of Ô¨Çow, maintaining salary and contact with workmates provide challenging tasks for the future; how to design tomorrow‚Äôs workplaces and tasks to suit young people and attract employees. Whether it was the rotation or the knife free work period that resulted in a reduction in work load, is impossible to distinguish. The open answers in the questionnaire indicate that the knife free work period was appreciated as a means of reducing work load. It is however possible that the rotation in itself provided a variation that contributed to the perceived reduction in physical work load. The meat cutters in P&B perceived better breaks and recovered better than before the changes. One reason for this could have been the reduced work load due to the rotation scheme and indications that the change was more thorough. Another reason might be a better design with more even work periods and breaks. As has been obvious in the open answers of the meat cutters, they are committed to their work and want to inÔ¨Çuence their work situation.  4.2.5. Other effects of  the changes  Most of those who answered the questions of other effects experienced no major change in their work. The effects of temporary workers were not an issue for this study and thus not assessed. It can be assumed (Lloyd and James, 2008) that increasing the number of temporary workers with low understanding of Swedish will increase the number of accidents and impair both the company and the union‚Äôs ability to work with health and safety issues. Some meat cutters expressed a concern that wages would decrease. This may pose a risk of meat cutters abandoning the trade to Ô¨Ånd another living resulting in a greater dependence on tem- porary workers. Both these issues are vital to the companys‚Äô future. When using Westgaard and Winkel‚Äôs model (2011) exchanging rationalizations for change as in this study, we can model some possible future outcomes. The participatory method, lesser physical load, better pauses and job satisfaction may result in better health for the meat cutters. The yearly medical examination may prove a valuable instrument to assess health issues. On the other hand, we do not know the effect on the packing personnel and others. Vink‚Äôs Ô¨Åndings (2006) add to the picture of participation as positive for both employee health and company productivity.  4.3.  Interviews  improvements in working conditions by decreasing work pace to achieve better yield and quality of products.  4.4. Document compilation  Nowhere in the annual reports were the changes for meat cut- ters mentioned. Both occupational injuries and sick leave may have many causes, but there are indications that the changes described in this paper have contributed positively. A major negative effect on company proÔ¨Åtability due to the changes seems unlikely. In the company‚Äôs statistics on occupational injuries, there were small changes between 2007 and 2010. Occupational injuries decreased from 79 to 77 and diseases from 13 to 11.  4.5.  Impact on industry  When the demands from the AV came, several representatives from the meat industry expressed a strong fear that the sustain- ability and competitiveness of the companies would be severely affected, both nationally and internationally (Ruteg√•rd, CEO of Swedish Meat Industry Association, personal communication 2011). In 2010, the AV extended their demands to all of the meat cutting industries. So far there is no evidence that the changes have had a great impact on their competitiveness. The company in this study as well as the other companies that the AV made demands on, made changes according to the requirements, and all of them are still in business. As working conditions for meat cutters is a problem in other countries, similar requirements may be expected there. Further studies are needed in order to reveal the economic impact of the AV requirements on the Swedish meat cutting business.  5.  Conclusions  The intervention (introducing a rotation scheme and reducing knife work to maximum 6 h per day) was regarded highly positive by a majority of the meat cutters. This work organization solution can thus be considered to be much better than the previous ones in this case. The interventions included non knife related work, work and rest pattern, job rotation and competence development, in addition to administrative, more long term improvements. The results further indicate that it was possible to reduce the time working with a knife to 6 h per day out of an 8 h working day without signiÔ¨Åcant Ô¨Ånancial losses. The rotation and knife free work how- ever made certain complementary measures necessary:   In order to make the rotation scheme work, the introduction of an individual competence and skill development programme for all meat cutters had to be introduced.  There was a need for easily adjustable workplaces since each worker changed workplace during each break. The time needed for adjusting the workplace to a worker therefore had to be minimized since this procedure could be required Ô¨Åve times a day. The technical system thus support the organiza- tional changes wanted.  Time should be allowed for Ô¨Ånding schemes and ramp up procedures.  The feeling of lost Ô¨Çow in work should be dealt within some way and might need some further examination.  appropriate  rotation  The supervisors were satisÔ¨Åed with the change process and as a whole with its results. They commented on productivity and yield. Both contribute to proÔ¨Åtability, but too high work pace decreases yield and quality. It seems to us that this was not clear to the su- pervisors.

Perceived accident risks were not particularly affected. Other major changes in work were not perceived by the meat cutters.

s0003687013000586," to, and characterisation of, Systems of Systems  The ergonomics profession is fairly well-equipped to deal with the socio-technical issues of systems, as the papers in this Special Issue attest. However, when one moves up to the next level of complexity, where systems themselves become bound into Sys- tems of Systems (SoS), more issues emerge that require consider- ation, and which affect both the application of systems ergonomics thinking at the lower level of systems and at the SoS level. This paper discusses these extra issues, and ways in which they may be addressed. By deÔ¨Ånition, SoS are much larger than the systems of which they are composed, and in many cases will be in existence for much longer than these component systems. They are often fundamental to the fabric of society and the functionality of the nation-state; examples are the government of the state itself; defence, law and order, and the continuous provision of energy, clean water, health & social security, and transport.  The aim of this paper is to highlight particular Human and Organisational issues that pertain to the design and operation of an SoS and to outline new approaches, methods and tools that need to be developed to address these issues. We begin by setting the context to provide a framework for the discussion which follows. Section 1 introduces some of the established ways of charac- terising SoS, and outlines some of the differences compared to Systems Engineering. Section 2 discusses a number of the socio- technical issues arising from these differences; section 3 outlines how complexity within an SoS renders nugatory the standard, reductionist approach to solving systems issues. Section 4 then addresses the problem of delivering resilience in a SoS, making use of the ‚Äòwicked problem‚Äô approach, and section 5 discusses the technical and engineering governance of SoS, without which the ‚Äòwicked problem‚Äô approach is unlikely ever to succeed, and Ô¨Ånally section 6 outlines a role for the SoS approach in addressing global drivers, as a way of showing its importance. However, on the basis of what goes up also comes down, the paper ends by considering some of the lingering drawbacks of this approach.  * Corresponding author. Tel.: √æ44 1509 7703050041.

86  C.E. Siemieniuch, M.A. Sinclair / Applied Ergonomics 45 (2014) 85e98  Jamshidi (2009) has reviewed more than seven deÔ¨Ånitions of SoS and, although none are accepted universally by the community, the following has received substantial support and is adopted for the purpose of this paper:  ‚ÄúA SoS is an integration of a Ô¨Ånite number of constituent systems which are independent and operable, and which are networked together for a period of time to achieve a certain higher goal‚Äù  (Jamshidi, 2009)  Firstly, it should be noted that according to this deÔ¨Ånition, for- mation of a SoS is not necessarily a permanent phenomenon, but rather a matter of necessity for integrating and networking systems in an organized way for speciÔ¨Åc goals such as robustness, cost, ef- Ô¨Åciency, etc. Secondly, there are overlaps with the concepts of Systems, and of Complex Adaptive Systems. Indeed, the SoS approach, as currently understood and discussed, can be seen as an organiza- tional version of the latter, and therefore as a class of system. However, the characteristic of managerial independence for the constituent systems and the implications that Ô¨Çow from this justify a separate classiÔ¨Åcation for SoS, as discussed later. As an example, consider a hospital, funded by the state, and serving a local community. In essence, this is a patient-processing system where initial triage deÔ¨Ånes the path each patient will take through the specialities, services and functions that are resident within the hospital, such as an ambulance service, X-ray, neuro- surgery, paediatrics, maternity, physiotherapy, ward management, nutrition, patient records, waste management, portering, mainte- nance and many more. Functionally, each of these services can be considered to be a system; for each there is a group of people supported by technol- ogy, intercommunicating and interoperating to reach a given goal, and, from a control perspective, able to do this independently of other systems. In practice, as opposed to just a control perspective, each of these will rely on the infrastructural systems such as water, power and so on in order to perform, and, on the basis of the Ô¨Çow of patients and information among the constituent systems, each will fulÔ¨Ål its goals. Fig. 1 illustrates the generic interfaces that such systems will require in order to participate long-term in a SoS. The inter-relationship among these systems is highlighted when the phenomenon of ‚Äòbed-blocking‚Äô occurs, as discussed cogently by  (Williams, 2010), where wards become full (for example because of a local epidemic or serious industrial accident). Because in the UK the hospital is legally obliged to accept patients, new ones are allocated to other wards. When these in turn become full, patients may be shifted on again; the problem becomes signiÔ¨Åcant when patient records on occasion are not able to keep up with this, and a patient may become temporarily ‚Äòlost‚Äô in the system of systems that com- prises the hospital, with a hunt going on to Ô¨Ånd the patient and restore the patient‚Äôs treatment path through the designated services.  1.2.  Characterisation of system of systems  A widely-adopted characterization (Maier, 1998) is given below:  - The elements of the system are themselves sufÔ¨Åciently com- plex to be considered systems - Operating together the systems produce functions and fulÔ¨Ål purposes not produced or fulÔ¨Ålled by the elements alone - The elements possess operational independence. Each element fulÔ¨Åls useful purposes whether or not connected to the assemblage. If disconnected the element can continue to fulÔ¨Ål useful purposes - The elements possess managerial independence. Each element is managed, at least in part, for its own purposes rather than the purposes of the collective.  As Maier points out, are:  the implications of  these characteristics  - The development of stable intermediate forms over time for the SoS. Since the constituent systems have managerial inde- pendence, they may evolve in their own ways. For the SoS to remain fully functional it may be necessary to identify inter- mediate forms that enable this evolutionary process to occur without compromising the whole SoS - There is a need for policy triage for the whole SoS; in other words, to know what can be Ô¨Åxed and what can‚Äôt. Standards and agreed functional protocols are a means of ensuring a degree of constancy and stability in the SoS. - Because of the endemic characteristic of managerial indepen- dence of the constituent systems, the main sources of leverage  Fig. 1.

In a system of systems, all of these interfaces will be active to ensure its long-term operation.

Necessarily, collaboration is human-centric process.  if a  Latterly, the Ô¨Åve SoS criteria above for SoS Engineering have been extended to include: inter-disciplinarity, heterogeneity of the systems involved, and networks of systems (DeLaurentis and Callaway, 2004). Not all SoS will exhibit all of the characteristics, but it is generally assumed that a SoS is characterised by exhibiting a majority of the Maier criteria, and particularly that of managerial independence. Although the individual systems in a SoS are usually considered to have independent operational viability, it is some- times the case that the SoS must contain some systems the only purpose of which is to enable the interoperation of the other component systems; i.e. the enabling systems cannot operate outside the SoS.  1.3.  Categorization of Systems of Systems  A further categorization of SoS has been proposed, reÔ¨Çecting different degrees of control over the SoS, moderating the effect of the implications above (Dahmann and Baldwin, 2008):  - Directed. Directed SoS are those in which the system-of- systems is created and managed to fulÔ¨Ål speciÔ¨Åc purposes and the constituent systems are subordinated to the SoS. This class of SoS is best accomplished within a single organisation, which has the authority, resources, common standards and protocols to act as the foundations of the SoS. - Acknowledged. Acknowledged SoS have recognized objectives, a designated manager, and resources for the SoS; however, the constituent systems retain their independent ownership, ob- jectives, funding, development and sustainment approaches. Supply chains in the automotive industry are an example of this class.  - Collaborative.  In collaborative SoS the component systems interact more or less voluntarily to fulÔ¨Ål agreed central pur- poses. This class of SoS is best suited to those SoS where the component systems are ‚Äòowned‚Äô by different organisations, all of whom are in fairly equal positions and there is no dominant organisation. The automotive and aviation industries provide examples of this. - Virtual. Virtual SoS lack a central management authority and a centrally agreed purpose for the system-of-systems. Large- scale behaviour emergesdand may be desirabledbut this type of SoS must rely on relatively invisible mechanisms to maintain it. The world-wide-web is often cited as an example of this.  While this is a useful categorization, it should be noted that most large SoS will have parts of the SoS that Ô¨Åt each of these categories, exacerbating the control problems.  1.4. Differences in approach to the engineering of SoS and systems  Table 1 below, taken from a recent report (Barot et al., 2012), outlines some of the differences in design and operation between systems and SoS. Many of these point to the need to consider SoS as examples of a ‚Äòwicked problem‚Äô (Rittel and Webber, 1973).  1.5.  Constraining the scope of  this paper  An industrial body, the ‚ÄòNetwork Centric Operations Industry Consortium‚Äô1 has identiÔ¨Åed a number of levels at which interop- eration at the interfaces of an SoS will occur (see Fig. 1). These are shown in Fig. 2. In recognition of the aims of the Journal and its readership, the discussion that follows is limited to just the Ô¨Åve upper levels of this diagram. This is merely a convenience, it is a mistake to assume that there is no interaction between the tech- nical and people levels.  1 https://www.ncoic.org/about/

It is clear that some degree of pragmatism is required, using some stopping rule such as ‚Äòthe system and its owner is within the socio-technical boundary if it is accessed more than 10 times per week, else it is outside the SoS‚Äô. An example of these issues was mentioned earlier; consider the policing SoS. The police force itself is composed of many systems to address the ills of society; recruitment, training, specialist units; development of procedures and processes, procurement, opera- tions, maintenance and disposal of assets, links to the prison, jus- tice and probation services, together with less-formal links to victims, criminals, witnesses, lawyers, informants, and the like. And all of these will require sustainment into the distant future.  Fig. 2. Layers of the NCOIC interoperability framework. This paper has been restricted to discussing only the top Ô¨Åve layers.  2.2. The organisational System of Systems engineering approach (OSoSE)  2.  Socio-technical  issues in the engineering of SoS  2.1.  The SOS boundary problem  There is a particular difÔ¨Åculty in deÔ¨Åning the boundaries of a System of Systems when a socio-technical perspective is adopted, arising from the fact that people are now included. It is the capacity of people to operate as thinking, decision-making, responsibility- accepting, goal-seeking entities that makes them of fundamental importance to organisations, and their needs for a support network (sustenance, relaxation, accommodation, training, recompense, etc.) which signiÔ¨Åcantly widens the boundaries to include many more systems. In relation to boundaries, time is of signiÔ¨Åcance. For SoS of short duration (e.g. a year or less), many support systems can be assumed to be stationary, because nothing much will change within that period. For longer-lasting systems, perhaps with an expected duration of 50 years or more (in effect, ‚Äòimmortal‚Äô), issues of sustainability and change immediately emerge (the social system of systems for policing society, for example). It is also observable that most of the long-life SoS are essential to the continuity, safety, security and well-being of citizens in all the nations of the world, and that many of these SoS are global in extent. Technically, there will be upgrades to the SoS at various in- tervals, occasioned by new technical developments, competitive pressures, and changes in goals for the SoS and its constituent systems. Socially, for the people in these SoS, there is the inevitable churn over time; as pointed out earlier, within 10 years of operation of a SoS it is likely that some 30% of its human operators and managers are likely to have been replaced, and all of them will have been replaced within 50 years. Furthermore, because humans have cognitive skills far exceeding the capabilities of technical systems in their scope and subtlety, including the ability to know what they don‚Äôt know, the boundaries of a SoS may have to be widened to include sources of information, knowledge and understanding such as professional societies and web-based networks. It may be necessary to include more amorphous ‚Äòcommunities of practice‚Äô (Wenger et al., 2004) and ‚Äòmegacommunities‚Äô (Napolitano, 2010), in which SoS organi- sations may pass information to external organisations in other SoS for their beneÔ¨Åt, without necessarily having a formal agreement to do so. In passing, this is a different arrangement to a Japanese keiretsu because there are no cross-holdings of shares to bind the participating companies together into a conglomerate and to entrain stability and inÔ¨Çuence among them. Naturally, the deÔ¨Ånition of SoS boundaries becomes even more difÔ¨Åcult when one appreciates that, for example, other members of  Hubbard et al. (2010) refer to an emerging approach known as Organisational Systems Engineering (OSE) which involves treating the organisation as a system, made up of human, process and technical sub-systems, which interact and interface with each other. Within a SoS context there will be many organisational systems involved in operating and controlling the SoS and hence OSE {from now on relabelled as Organisational Systems of Systems Engineering or OSoSE) will need to incorporate additional purposes as noted below:   Maintain the purposes of the SoS, including the strategies and  Ensure that the SoS conÔ¨Åguration is Ô¨Åt for purpose policies that enable the purposes to be reached  Ensure interoperability of the systems that comprise the SoS  Ensure that the SoS, and the systems within it, are resilient and agile with respect to both foreseeable and unforeseeable risks, the latter requiring considerable human involvement should they eventuate (Provan and Milward, 1995; Barabasi, 2002;  Accommodate the restrictions on information Ô¨Çows around the deMeyer et al., 2002) SoS caused by Intellectual Property Rights, commercial conÔ¨Å-  Ensure compliance with legal and regulatory requirements (the dentiality, security requirements, and many other sources. ‚Äòstay out of jail‚Äô requirement)  Assure distributed situation awareness to minimise the likeli- hood and consequences of emergent SoS behaviour  Enable evolution of the SoS to occur with minimum disruption  We give two examples of the need for OS0SE; the Ô¨Årst is a military example, in which the USAF B52 bomber, which entered service in 1955 as a high-altitude, nuclear-capable strategic bomber. It is still in service nearly 60 years later, but is now adapted for a role as a high-altitude, close air support capability for ground troops, with an appropriately-reconÔ¨Ågured support network (Willis, 2005a), both to keep it in the air and to enable it to carry out its missions accurately and precisely. This example demonstrates the evolutionary issue for SoS; furthermore, it is noteworthy that given the near 60 years‚Äô service lifetime of this aircraft type, there will be nobody actively involved in the support of its current capability who was there at the beginning e the longevity issue. The second example is from the automotive industry (ShefÔ¨Å, 2005). In the 1990s, Toyota supplier Aisin Seiki made P-valves for brake systems. These anti-skid valves regulate pressure across the brake system, and this company supplied 99% of all Toyota models. Factory No.1, manufacturing these valves, caught Ô¨Åre; 506 machine tools were destroyed. Toyota‚Äôs alternate supplier was Nishin Kogyo, making 1%, and unable to ramp up production fast enough. Toyota  
C.E. Siemieniuch, M.A. Sinclair / Applied Ergonomics 45 (2014) 85e98  89  at this time was running at 115% of normal production, as a com- mercial response to impending legislation. Because of just-in-time processes, Toyota had only a few hours‚Äô stock of valves, with trucks on the road carrying another 2 day‚Äôs capacity. Aisin salvaged some tools, replaced others and was in production in 2 weeks, making 10% of requirements and 60% after 6 weeks, and 100% after 2 months. Both Aisin and Toyota, in their respective keiretsus, asked for help. 22 organisations from the Aisin keiretsu and 36 from the Toyota keiretsu replied. Within 5 days, Aisin had made available blueprints and process expertise and production had been allocated. Notably, Denso, a major Toyota supplier, outsourced their own production to free up tools and processes to produce these P-valves (as did others), and helped to develop alternative processes for the valves using different preci- sion tools in other smaller suppliers. Within 2 days some valves were delivered by these alternate suppliers; within 9 days of the Ô¨Åre, all Toyota plants were functioning as normal again. During this period, neither Ô¨Ånancial nor legal negotiation took place, nor was pressure applied to Aisin Seiki to prioritise Toyota over other customers such as Hino trucks. However, Aisin eventu- ally covered the direct costs e labour, equipment, materials involved for these suppliers, and Toyota gave their Tier 1 suppliers 1% of their respective sales to Toyota for the JanuaryeMarch quarter as an appreciation gesture. These Ô¨Årms passed on the beneÔ¨Åt pro rata to their suppliers, and so on. The examples have been chosen to highlight some of the important human and organisational issues concerning SoS; the need for adaptability, resilience and evolutionary planning. These examples are not unique; other similar (and dissimilar) cases are known around the globe, in different industries in different coun- tries. Altogether, there are many more aspects inÔ¨Çuencing OSoSE that have been discussed in the professional literature; for example, (Keating et al., 2003; Fisher, 2006; Schaeffer, 2006; DOD, 2008; Rebovich, 2008; Sousa-Poza et al., 2008; Jamshidi, 2009). We discuss a selection of the issues below, using the classes of Gov- ernment & Legal, Strategic, Policy, Operations and Transaction while bearing in mind the common threads across this classiÔ¨Åca- tion; bounded knowledge, continuous change, longevity, and the need for resilience.  2.3. Government & legal  At this level, the three main considerations are the legal framework that ensures competition (in a capitalist society), the governance of SoS, and the implications for society in general should any (or several) critical SoS fail. The competition issue arises when in a given industry, various groups of organisations band together to form SoS that are more able to meet market demands, and thus secure a competitive advantage. At a simplistic level, if most of the organisations involved become components of various SoS, the net effect is to reduce the number of competitors in that market. Furthermore, if some of the SoS are larger than others, they may also accrue an advantage merely due to their size. For example, a major clothing retailer in Europe was in a posi- tion where most of its national suppliers sent to it about 30% of their production, making that retailer the major customer whose contract was critical to the survival of the supplier. This meant that the retailer was in a very powerful position to control the supply chain. Over a number of years, because of its size and buying power, the retailer moved into the purchase of raw materials for its supply chain, with the acquiescence of its suppliers. This evolutionary move meant that the retailer had control of input to its suppliers, and control over the suppliers‚Äô output, and in principle resulted in a coercive SoS. Fortunately, the retailer was very ethical in its deal- ings, so the practical outcome was that the suppliers were buffered  from the vagaries of the supply-side market very well, and goods for this retailer were produced at lower cost compared to the same goods for other retailers. In a competitive, capitalist economy, this amounts to a loss of competition, which may lessen the beneÔ¨Åts that society is expected to gain from such an economy. While this argument is indeed simplistic and somewhat purist, it does point to a role for govern- mental oversight and for a legal basis for intervention. Both of these require suitable metrics and trigger points for governmental action, and these are probably best addressed by the establishment of a SoS as a legal entity responsible for its actions and the provision of a governance framework for any such SoS. This becomes especially important when a SoS is of critical importance for the security of society in general.  2.4.  Strategic  This level is concerned with the strategy of the SoS itself. Its strategy will depend on its environment, the volatility of that environment, its geographic spread across different legislations in different national states, and the nature of its business domain and its perceived risks (deMeyer et al., 2002; Hammer, 2002; TranÔ¨Åeld et al., 2004; ShefÔ¨Å, 2005; Fisher, 2006; Woods and Hollnagel, 2006; Sinclair, 2007; Siemieniuch and Sinclair, 2008; Taleb, 2008). There are two important aspects to this; Ô¨Årstly the operational processes that deliver capability or services that meet the purpose of the SoS, and secondly the maintenance of the SoS itself as it transforms itself over its lifetime to meet extant exigencies, both expected and unexpected. For SoS that may be classed as Directed or Acknowledged, it may be possible to set up Steering Committees and Management Committees (or equivalents) to manage the strategic and policy issues that will arise e NATO military expeditions are an example; in the civilian world, in the UK there is the mandatory ATOL scheme designed to provide a ‚Äòget you home‚Äô service for air travellers booking through holiday companies, requiring those companies Ô¨Årstly to be registered and assessed, and to contribute to an in- surance scheme for the air travellers. For co-operative and virtual SoS, such as the rapidly-growing ‚ÄòInternet of Things‚Äô eIoT (Marsden, 2012; Swaminathan, 2012), it is largely left to the constituent sys- tems to manage these, through their interfaces. For all of these, and particularly the Co-operative and Virtual SoS, they will Ô¨Çourish best on a ‚Äòlevel playing Ô¨Åeld‚Äô delineated and supervised by governments.  2.5.  Policy  This general level is more concerned with how the SoS regulates and constrains what and how it executes its business. It is at this level where considerations such as inter-organisational trust, partnering, service level agreements, and contracts are important. Various fundamental issues such as the potential clash between lean operations and the need for resilience must be addressed, and plans for risk mitigations are prepared. As an example, in the automotive industry lean operations imply the smooth, continuous running of assembly lines with minimal holdings of stocks. In turn, this means an operating environment of constant state and ‚Äòno surprises‚Äô. To achieve this for the production process requires much managerial and organisational effort around the edges of the pro- cess. This can be achieved by extending the stable environment as far as is possible up the supply chain, so that the managerial effort is moved elsewhere. The result, as shown in the Aisin Seiki example mentioned earlier, becomes more brittle; less able to withstand interruptions to supply and any other emergent happenings that impinge on the whole supply chain. Of particular importance in these is the issue of SoS complexity, considered in more detail in  
90  C.E. Siemieniuch, M.A. Sinclair / Applied Ergonomics 45 (2014) 85e98  section 3, because of the likely occurrence of unwanted emergent behaviour characteristic of systemic complexity. Inter-organisational trust is vital. Because of the bounded- knowledge problem, most SoS operate with incomplete knowl- edge most of the time. This implies that organisations in the SoS must behave with integrity and fairness, in order that other orga- nisations may predict with some accuracy the likely behaviour, and operate accordingly. Some reassurance will be generated by the terms of contracts, service-level agreements and other formal ar- rangements; however, unexpected disruptions and other emergent behaviour is always likely (consider the Aisin-Toyota example above), and it is trust in the promises and performance of others that enables co-operative solutions to be found quickly. The intra- organisational conditions for the building of trustworthy behav- iour have been discussed elsewhere (Siemieniuch and Sinclair, 2000; 2002); however, some implications for the organisational interfaces within the SoS are discussed below, since they apply to SoS in government, military and civilian domains.   In many inter-organisational interfaces within the SoS, it is the relationship and authority of the roles on each side of the interface that is important. Authority over resources is also important, to obtain the swift response necessary to deal with the day-to-day disturbances and the occasional ‚Äòblack swans‚Äô that are characteristic of SoS operations within noisy envi- ronments. An implication of this is that the interfacing roles should not have long chains of approvals above them in order to obtain appropriate reactions to events, and maintain the resilience of the SoS. However, in order for delegation of au- thority and responsibility to work well, there are a number of other issues to be addressed; situation awareness, communi- cations, knowledge and information dissemination being three of these. In other words, the interfaces should be seen as ‚Äòthick‚Äô interfaces; not just abut the transfer of information and prod- ucts, but reaching further into the organisations to include their cultures and ways of working.  Many of the interactions that happen across such interfaces are small-scale problems that require solutions that are not envisaged in the formal agreements between organisations, or may require some ‚Äòbending‚Äô of the rules on both sides of the interface for efÔ¨Åcient, swift resolution of the problem. For such exercises to work well, each organisation must have an appropriate culture; good, distributed knowledge of opera- tions, ‚Äòwork-arounds‚Äô and events; and devolved authority and responsibility. It also helps if the personnel involved across the interface know each other well, so that they may trust each other during the rule-bending phase.  One organisation may have several interfaces with another organisation within the SoS, each managed independently of the other interfaces (e.g. operations, maintenance, Ô¨Ånancial, etc). This can create a confused image of each organisation, depending on the quality of the interfaces. This points to the need for a strong organisational culture of co-operation, so that the important characteristics for the SoS are dominant. These are usually honesty, integrity, rapid and effective response, the willingness to share both beneÔ¨Åts and pain, and respect e in short, the usual characteristics of partnering. These may differ for different SoS, but, whatever the set, they should be demonstrated across all the interfaces.  ideal for the SoS is smooth operations within the established strategic and policy constraints of each of the individual organisa- tions and of the SoS in which they are embedded. The quality of each interface between the organisations is critical in achieving this ideal, and we discuss some issues below; Ô¨Årstly for ITC, and then organisational. For ITC, the use of well-established open architectures, stan- dards, codes of practice, agreed terminology, etc., is essential. Nevertheless, there remains the problem that local interpretation of these by the designers of software systems, which in the past has resulted in the concatenation of several different ‚Äòbest in class‚Äô systems supposedly designed in accordance with the same inter- face standards, failing to interoperate as consistently as required. The resilience requirements of SoS indicate that there should be provision within each organisational interface of sufÔ¨Åciently- skilled personnel to devise suitable ‚Äòwork-arounds‚Äô to allow the SoS to keep operational until a more complete solution is devised. Since these failures of interoperation are likely to occur when un- usual circumstances pertain, there is a need for some careful resource planning for this. For the organisation that is contributing a system to a SoS, there are some structural considerations for resilience and smooth op- erations within the SoS. A service-oriented organisational archi- tecture is a good option in most cases, since its priorities Ô¨Åt the needs of organisations within a SoS. Whatever structure is adopted by an organisation to suit its circumstances, it is likely that a particular issue will have to be addressed; the potential clash be- tween process integrity and process delivery. There will always be pressures, driven by the changing environment of the organisation; to adjust processes to Ô¨Åt a given SoS needs more economically, or more effectively. However, if the process also services other SoS, or there are duplicate processes for other SoS, any such adjustment can result in a loss of overall process integrity and resilience. There appears to be no generalised solution to this issue; each organisa- tion must Ô¨Ånd its own best solution. In addition, there is the issue of potential incompatibilities of operations within the SoS. Fig. 3 below (Gover, 1993) illustrates this, showing a lifecycle for organisations in the computer-chip manufacturing industry, with changes in the drivers for the organisational architecture and operations as the lifecycle matures. It may be that different organisations within a single SoS are at different stages of lifecycle maturity of the market and hence have different drivers and management styles appropriate to these. Clearly this could present incompatibilities on each side of an inter- organisational interface. Equally clearly, the possible existence of these incompatibilities indicates the importance of the consider- ations discussed in this paper, necessary to ameliorate these incompatibilities.  2.7.  Transactions  At this level, Information Technology and Communications (ITC) play a critical part. From an organisational perspective, the goal for transactions is to deliver at the interface(s) the content of the transaction (product, capability, information, etc) on time, in full, and at acceptable quality, according to service level agreements. Organisationally, this requires attention to all of the matters dis- cussed above. From an ITC perspective, this implies attention to architectures, networks, protocols, taxonomies, and security issues.  2.8.  Summary  2.6. Operations  It is at this level where organisational and Information and Communications technologies (ICT) considerations overlap. The  This section has discussed a number of impediments to the efÔ¨Åcient and effective operations of an SoS. These impediments occur at a number of levels, ranging from the super-SoS level where

Illustration of different organisational drivers, given the state of maturity of the market.  from (Gover, 1993).  governmental and regulatory issues are addressed, down to the level of transactions, which are the real-world expression of the functionality of the SoS.  3.  The effects of organisational complexity on SoS  Having mentioned the term, ‚Äòcomplexity‚Äô, in the discussions above, it is timely to ensure clarity of meaning for the term, from an organisational perspective. By the very nature of the SoS concept, it suffuses all aspects of the SoS. Sometimes complexity within the SoS aids the purpose and operations of the SoS; more often complexity manifests itself in emergent behaviour that is both unexpected and detrimental to the smooth functioning of the SoS. Unfortunately, there are a number of deÔ¨Ånitions: for example (Simon, 1981; Allen, Boulton et al., 2005; Kuras and White, 2005; Sheard, 2005). For this paper the authors have adopted the following:   ‚ÄúComplexity is a behavioural characteristic of the network of agents and relationships that make up the system. It is not decomposable to individual elements or relationships.‚Äù (Siemieniuch and Sinclair, 2002)  Considering each organisation/system within a SoS, acteristics that deÔ¨Åne it as complex are (Gregg, 1996):  the char-   Many agents, of different kinds  Some degree of behavioural autonomy for agents  Multiple steady states for agents  Interactions between agents in an environment  Lots of connections between agents  Communicating in parallel  Effects of an evolving environment  Effects of evolving agents  Interactions between different goals within an agent  Interactions between agents with different goals  Language/culture differences  As Gregg pointed out, ‚ÄúIf several of these are present, the global behaviour of the system is likely to be unpredictable, long-term‚Äù.  For a SoS, having systems with such characteristics within the SoS is a near-guarantee of emergent behaviour. At the level of the SoS, the implication is that OSoSE necessarily must address resilience. Furthermore, there is the ‚ÄòLaw of conservation of complexity‚Äô, attributed to (Woods and Hollnagel, 2006):  ""Complexity is conserved under transformation and translation"".  This does indeed appear to be a law as observed empirically and is in accordance with the complexity deÔ¨Ånitions referred to above. However, there are two loopholes; Ô¨Årstly, it seems to be possible to translate complexity to different parts of the SoS which provide a more amenable environment where managerial action can ameliorate the effects of complexity more easily and more effec- tively. Secondly, it is necessary to distinguish between two types of complexity; induced and intrinsic. Intrinsic complexity is in the nature of the problem being addressed, and conforms to the law above. Induced complexity, on the other hand, arises from the way in which the SoS (or its component organizations) organize themselves to address the situation. Induced complexity can be reduced, or even near-eliminated, by appropriate organizational design, and a prime function of OSoSE is to address this. An example of both of these points is provided by a Colombian bakery, as the excerpt below indicates (Guitink et al., 1994):  ‚ÄúAn example from Colombia . Productos Ramos S.A., an in- dustrial bakery, was faced with an aging Ô¨Çeet of delivery trucks. Not only did replacement mean a large cash outlay, but the 135 trucks often operated with partial loads and had trouble parking their destination. . However, after near considering all the options, the bakery introduced a decentralized computerized distribution system e a Ô¨Çeet of 50 trucks hauled products to satellite warehouses, where a Ô¨Çeet of 904 [independent] cargo- tricycles picked up the goods for Ô¨Ånal delivery. As a result of this inter-modal integration, distribution costs dropped from 27 to 8 percent of total costs, and employment increased substantially‚Äù  A similar example concerns the EU; a global supplier in the ‚ÄòFast Moving Consumer Goods‚Äô (FMCG) retail sector had factories across the EU, supplying the local region with a range of products. These factories were efÔ¨Åcient, but had signiÔ¨Åcant downtime because of frequent changes of product. The complexities of reducing this  
92  C.E. Siemieniuch, M.A. Sinclair / Applied Ergonomics 45 (2014) 85e98  downtime proved to be enormous; the company took a different route. It reduced the range of products within each factory, and distributed them more widely. Net, they removed induced complexity from the production side and moved it to the distri- bution side, where the complexities could be managed more efÔ¨Å- ciently and at lower cost. It is instructive at this point to consider a comment by Alberts. He has said, cogently (Alberts, 2011):  ‚ÄúIf it is local interactions that give rise to the outcomes that occur, we can no longer think about organizing activities solely from a top-down perspective. The simple fact is that complex systems or situations cannot be predicted or controlled. The best that one can hope for is to exert some inÔ¨Çuence to keep behaviors within acceptable bounds.  As a result, there is virtually nothing left in our traditional tool kit to deal with the degree of difÔ¨Åculty that attends complex endeavors.‚Äù  Clearly, then, resilience of any SoS is a prime engineering requirement, and as a general remark, will best be delivered by humans operating within the SoS.  3.1. Approaches to complexity and resilience in SoS socio-technical systems  Two portmanteau concepts encountered in discussions of SoS are Agility, and Resilience. Depending on the author, each can include the other. For the purposes of this section, we assume that one cannot be resilient unless one has agility. The deÔ¨Ånition of resilience, then, is as follows:  "".the capacity of a system to absorb disturbance and reorganize while undergoing change so as to still retain essentially the same function, structure, identity, and feedbacks"". (Walker et al, 2004).  Organisationally, resilient:  several  characteristics  are  required  to  be   Organisational coherence is critical, and implies: B better design of the organisation to reÔ¨Çect the needs and purposes of the SoS e roles, allocation of responsibilities and authority, resources, rewards, etc. B shared values, culture and goals B open access to information and knowledge  Process measurement is critical  Acceptance of organisational organisation and within the SoS  ConÔ¨Çict management is a necessary, fundamental skill middle and top-level managers, and a desirable skill personnel.  reconstruction  both within  for all for all  Unfortunately, providing solutions to these requirements is not trivial. Adapting Alberts in his discussion of complexity and agility/ resilience (Alberts, 2011):   Because emergent behaviour is a major characteristic of complexity, it removes the use of reductionism as an approach to understand SoS problems. Instead, understanding must come from experience and simulations, through the recogni- tion of patterns.  Because we cannot predict the long-term future, we cannot determine whether an envisaged solution is good or bad, long- term. This implies that resilience is a critical attribute for SoS, together with close attention to the trajectory of the SoS in time, so that the patterns of mistakes and their associated lessons from the past are not repeated.   Adopting an incremental change approach as an alternative way forwards is unlikely to work all the time, because it may encounter emergent discontinuities in SoS behaviour, due to limits on resilience for individual systems, for example. Nevertheless, given a resilient SoS and an environment of lower variability, it is one way to evolve the functionality and  Because of the inherent characteristic of bounded knowledge performance of the SoS. in the SoS, it is probable that problem solvers will face situa- tions that they do not completely understand and perhaps cannot hope to understand, particularly when information Ô¨Çows are limited by policy constraints, etc. Simulation is probably the best help in this, as will the avoidance of decisions that cannot be undone, since recovery from terminal decisions that turn out to be bad ones may not be possible.  Because emergent behaviour tends to be local, with possible global consequences, a centralized, top-down organizational approach to design and operation of a SoS is unlikely to suc- ceed. The best that one can expect is to exert leadership to keep behaviours within acceptable bounds, to ensure that the or- ganization is agile with well-informed people, to ensure that decision-making is devolved rather than centralized, and then rely on resilience to maintain progress.  This last list is an exercise in doom and gloom for the standard approach of top-down decomposition of problems; fortunately, it should be noted that SoS vary in the stability of their environments and internal characteristics, so that for some SoS in stable envi- ronments, a standard approach might work well. For most others, this is not so, and it is useful to consider other managerial ap- proaches. Adapting (deMeyer et al., 2002), we may offer the following classiÔ¨Åcation of approaches:   Stable environments (i.e. ‚Äònormality‚Äô is an achievable, recog- nisable state). Orthodox managerial approaches are sufÔ¨Åcient  Foreseeable uncertainty (i.e. likely disturbances and changes are foreseeable, but not their timing). This environment re- quires risk management techniques, decision trees and pre- paratory planning, to enable appropriate, agile adjustments to whatever happens.  Unforeseeable uncertainty (i.e. there is no Plan B). Managers are required to be Ô¨Çexible orchestrators, networkers, and am- bassadors. Trust within and between organisations is critical. Scan horizons continuously, and sign Ô¨Çexible contracts. The Aisin-Toyota example discussed earlier is in this category.  Fast-changing or chaotic environments (for example, due to disasters). Managers must be entrepreneurs and knowledge managers. Resilience depends critically on having long-term relationships beyond individual SoS lifecycles. Inter- organisational relationships must be based on trust and handshakes, rather than formal negotiations and legal docu- ments. Continuous, ruthless concentration on go/no-go de- cisions will be required, with planning horizons limited to the next identiÔ¨Åable decision point.  For the last three of these environments, the copious literature on ‚ÄòHigh Reliability Organisations‚Äô is of relevance (Weick et al., 1999; Bigley and Roberts, 2001; Rosness et al., 2001; Sullivan and Beach, 2003; Grote, 2004; TranÔ¨Åeld et al., 2004; Weick and Sutcliffe, 2007; Strigini, 2012).  3.2.  The ‚Äòwicked problem‚Äô approach  In the sections above, it has been pointed out that, depending on the nature of the SoS, different managerial approaches will be  
Table 2 The characteristics of wicked problems‚Äô, comments on these, and mitigation approaches.  C.E. Siemieniuch, M.A. Sinclair / Applied Ergonomics 45 (2014) 85e98  93  Commentary w.r.t. SoS  Mitigation  ‚ÄòWicked‚Äô problem characteristic (from Rittel and Webber, 1973; Daw, 2007)  There is no deÔ¨Ånitive formulation of a wicked problem  Wicked problems have no stopping rule  Solutions are not true or false, but rather better or worse  There is no immediate and no ultimate test of a solution to a wicked problem  Every solution to a wicked problem is a ‚Äòone-shot operation‚Äô.  Wicked problems do not have an enumerable (or exhaustively describable) set of potential solutions, nor a well-described set of permissible operations that may be incorporated into the plan Every wicked problem is essentially unique  Characteristics of SoS endorse this; evolving context, SoS duration, incomplete knowledge, evolving SoS boundaries, etc. Furthermore, the disciplinary perspectives of the analysts, allied to their lack of complete knowledge and the complexities of real-world SoS, preclude a synoptic viewpoint. SoS evolution & increasing interconnectedness of the operating environment mean that feedback loops are many and are likely to be hidden from a logical, functional analysis. Hence, a perceived ‚Äòsolution‚Äô may only operate well within a restricted contextual range, with the edges of the range characterised by emergence  What looks like a good solution today may become a bad one, with evidence, tomorrow, because of the evolution of, and feedback loops within, the SoS, its systems, and the environment. Consequently, it should be recognised that potential solutions to problems come with a time horizon This is a logical conclusion from the characteristics above. The implication of this is that design and redesign of the SoS is a continuous process over the operational lifecycle of the SoS  Because SoS operate in the real world, with feedback loops, disparate aims, etc., any solution instantiated within the SoS will produce reactive Ô¨Çexing of the SoS, moving it to a different state of stability (albeit probably temporary), with different behavioural patterns.  Because of the interconnectedness of the SoS in its environment, and because of the multiple states in which each system components (including human decision-makers) can exist, even a slow pace of evolution precludes enumeration  For two problems to be the same, all the relevant characteristics of the SoS would have to be the same. But the passage of time precludes this; as Heracleitus said, ‚Äòyou cannot step into the same river twice‚Äô.  Stakeholder feedback, visualisation & forecasting techniques, simulations, and continuous governance activities to become aware as soon as possible of emergence of issues and problem characteristics.  Again, visualisation & forecasting techniques, simulations, and continuous governance activities to become aware as soon as possible of emergence of issues. Aim for resilience of the SoS.  Many SoS come into being to replace some less-functional precursor SoS; studying the latter is always a worthwhile exercise, as is continuous observation and evaluation of the current SoS. Use of these inputs may increase the likelihood of solutions being better rather than worse. Issues of assurance become more important than acceptance criteria, with a recognition of solution horizons. This should be supported by extensive use of modelling, simulation and visualisation techniques to provide conÔ¨Ådence throughout the decision making stages and beyond instantiation into operations The maintenance and exploration of representations of the SoS through models and simulations should be a continuous, ongoing process to accumulate knowledge and understanding. Inputs from governance processes will provide valuable inputs to this, resulting in a communicable basis for the development of new solutions. A different approach is required; instead of developing requirements and then generating solutions for these, a process of characterising SoS behavioural patterns is required, allied to an architectural approach to deÔ¨Åne and separate regular and labile patterns, perhaps requiring different architectures; so that a more resilient, adaptable SoS can be created. It must be expected that the SoS architecture will require alteration over time. At abstract levels, there will be similarities between wicked problems. However, operationally there will be detailed differences of signiÔ¨Åcance. Recognition of these a priori requires wisdom; however, this is often in short supply, the effective response is to make use of distributed wisdom, by entraining the contributions of as many stakeholders as possible. As stated above, it should be noted that many SoS come into being to replace some less-functional precursor SoS; studying the latter is always a worthwhile exercise. The concept of potential residual wickedness at the point of implementation recognises that not all risks, difÔ¨Åculties and unknowns can be removed from the lifecycle of a SoS. Coherent, informed, distributed, decision making and information management, with particular attention to the maintenance of resilience and agility will best mitigate this issue. The usual, classical approach to addressing such discrepancies when they arise is to assign people to mitigate their effect, making use of human knowledge, adaptability, and resilience. A longer-term approach is to accumulate multiple representations of the discrepancy from stakeholders and, by simulation and discussion, generate a solution to the discrepancy This characteristic points to the need for extensive visualisation and description exercises during problem exploration, continuous modelling and simulation during SoS design, extensive veriÔ¨Åcation and validation, allied to incremental instantiation. For example, upgrades to the SoS should be instantiated in parallel, followed by replacement. ‚ÄòBig bang‚Äô approaches should be avoided  Every wicked problem can be considered to be a symptom of another problem  The existence of a discrepancy in representing a wicked problem can be explained in numerous ways. The choice of explanation determines the nature of the problem‚Äôs resolution The planner/designer has no right to be wrong  This attribute results from the indeterminacy, multiple feedback loops and evolution characteristic of SoS. This may show itself in emergence, where the generation of a solution has the effect of forcing the engineers/managers to chase the problem round the SoS forever, watching it transform into different forms in different parts of the SoS. This has been observed in real SoS. Such discrepancies may emerge because they are intrinsic to the wicked problem; it is also possible that they emerge because of the way in which the SoS operates e i.e. they are induced discrepancies because of the structure and deÔ¨Åned processes of the SoS. The latter can sometimes be recognised at the point when organisations within the SoS Ô¨Ånd it necessary to wave contracts at each other during arguments. SoS exist in the real world, staffed by real people in real organisations, and may be critical to the security and well-being of the society. The possible repercussions of being wrong preclude the option of being wrong.  needed for the organisations that comprise SoS; in other words, a combination of OSE and OSoSE is required in order to deliver a SoS that attains its goals. What will make this already-difÔ¨Åcult, complex task even more difÔ¨Åcult is the unknowns; the diffuse boundary of the SoS, the effects of IPRs, conÔ¨Ådentiality and security  considerations on information Ô¨Çows, the disparate aims of the or- ganisations that comprise the SoS, and so on. These continual un- certainties imply that we should approach the design of SoS as dealing with a ‚Äòwicked problem‚Äô (Rittel and Webber, 1973; Vicente et al., 1997; Conklin, 2006; Daw, 2007). Fortunately, a degree of  
94  C.E. Siemieniuch, M.A. Sinclair / Applied Ergonomics 45 (2014) 85e98  systemisation has been brought to this approach, compiled into Table 2 below. This table discusses the characteristics of wicked problems, how they are exhibited, and amelioration activities to these characteristics e not solutions, because wicked problems do not have long-term solutions. A Ô¨Ånal key element which need to be addressed in OSOSE is overall governance of the SoS: this is discussed in the following section.  4.  System of systems technical and engineering governance  4.1.  Background  As stated previously in this paper, despite the fact that our safety, health, education, security, etc. depends on the steady, reliable functioning of SoS, we do not understand enough about the multiple, non-linear connections and dependencies among component systems (as the discussion about wicked problems in- dicates), nor of the way that they may self-organise and co-evolve within a constantly changing environment over a lifetime. Furthermore these SoS are pervasive through our societies and increasingly are interlinked in a global and distributed fashion. Upgrades or new systems will be required to Ô¨Åt into this complex SoS environment e rarely will they be standalone e and current engineering, governance and control strategies need reconsidera- tion in order to cope with the resultant degrees of uncertainty and unpredictable emergent behaviour that is endemic in the design and operation of these SoS. Hence a wider understanding of Technical and Engineering Governance (TEG) for SoS is required to provide essential input to the process of ameliorating the wicked problem that the SoS can represent. TEG also provides essential support for the tenets of corporate governance (Cadbury, 1992; Turnbull, 1997; OECD, 1999). Governance in general is concerned with the three questions:   Are we doing the right things (leadership)  Are we doing those things right? (management)  How do we know this? (metrics and measurement processes)  We now consider how these questions might be answered for a SoS, with respect to TEG.  4.2. Aims of  technical and engineering governance  Any kind of Technical and Engineering Governance framework for an SoS should aim to control and monitor the engineering function in an effective way, but with the prime aim of not stiÔ¨Çing innovation which is necessary to retain a competitive edge. The following are an initial proposed series of objectives that a TEG framework should aim to achieve:   Manage the engineering function along the SoS lifecycle effectively and efÔ¨Åciently in order to meet or comply with all requirements placed upon it from the customer/stakeholders, other internal business functions (eg Ô¨Ånance) and any external usage, safety or other constraints in the SoS environment.  Comply with any associated engineering legislation that may impact on the design or operation of the SoS. An example of this would be airworthiness requirements.  Ensure that the engineering function within the SoS is Ô¨Çexible and adaptive to change since SoS requirements from cus- tomers/stakeholders are likely to change over the life-cycle of the SoS, dependent on need and changes in the SoS environment.   Ensure that the engineering function is acting in support of the overall enterprise system delivering the SoS to avoid repli- cating the situation in some organisations where there is a large wall between the engineering function and the rest of the business, which can breed an ‚Äòus-and-them‚Äô attitude which is counter-productive  Deploy ‚Äòbest practice‚Äô processes in the different engineering areas and ensure that key decision making roles are clearly identiÔ¨Åed. The engineering function should ensure that the conÔ¨Åguration of competences among its staff is optimal, and deploy those competent staff to roles in the most effective and Ô¨Çexible way.  4.3.  Possible model of  technical and engineering governance (TEG)  The context of governance for different systems within an SoS involves several issues including TEG goals and strategy, policies, existing TEG processes and any recognised TEG problems or risks. Work on an EPSRC Innovative Manufacturing and Construction Research Centre Project at Loughborough University (Nendick et al., 2006) proposed a To Be Model for Engineering Governance. Three key components are fundamental to this model:   Governance Mechanisms deÔ¨Åne the actual   Governance Agents are the people involved in some way with governance Ô¨Çows. Agents include top-level executive man- agement who govern the engineering function, line managers, down to engineers and technicians who work on different SoS subsystems. The structure of the relationships between the various agents is complex, varied and sometimes informal. Therefore, the modelling of agents and the structures of re- lationships between them is a crucial step to understanding the current state of TEG within a particular SoS. implementation of TEG throughout the SoS. Different organisations within the SoS are likely to use a different array of mechanisms depending on the speciÔ¨Åc circumstances or the nature of the SoS that is being delivered. It has been established that there are 8 main classes of mechanisms commonly in use throughout engineering organisations: B External drivers e These are standards such as ISO-9000 that may be mandated through customer requirements. B Internal drivers e Initiatives such as CMMI (Ibrahim et al., 2004) B Regulations e Laws with regard to environment etc. that individuals complying with. B Structure e Including the engineering management hierar- chy and Roles and Responsibilities of agents. B Process e Systems of Systems engineering and lifecycle processes that specify how certain activities should be car- ried out. B Tools e The tools, such as software packages, that support other mechanisms. B Groups e Groups such as groups and peer reviews. B Informal e Other informal mechanisms ment styles and culture.  committees, working/steering  product safety, are responsible  the for  such as manage-  Two critical issues will immediately be apparent: the existence of these mechanisms is not enough e it is in the execution of these that governance resides, and this depends on the disciplined, motivated approach of the personnel involved; secondly a disci- plined, motivated approach to any organisational goal depends on the company culture, structure of authority, and leadership. If TEG  
C.E. Siemieniuch, M.A. Sinclair / Applied Ergonomics 45 (2014) 85e98  95  is to be assured, then these issues must be addressed as well. The development of an overall control subset within the SoS engi- neering governance framework will be key to this.   Governance Feedback is crucial to gauging the effectiveness of the TEG strategy at any one time. Examples of governance feedback include: B Audits e Full (mechanisms). B Whistle-blowing channels e Give those at the bottom of the management structure a link to the top for important matters. B Metrics e Special metrics to evaluate aspects of governance. B Meetings e Hold meetings with agents at different levels.  governance  assessment  state  the  of  of  A particular issue that must also be considered here is the effect of complexity. As outlined above, the conditions exist for un- pleasant surprises to occur in the SoS, even in an environment of dedicated engineers doing their best to meet their goals. These could be due to many factors, apart from cutting-edge issues in engineering. These include such things as different groups reaching different levels of maturity in the design of inter-related compo- nents or systems, unexpected interactions between unrelated components or systems, different interpretations of documents and drawings, and so on. Because of the nature of complexity, it pre- cludes top-down control, and demands a degree of self- government throughout the engineering systems within the SoS. The delivery of organisational structures and training that encourage this, are important. It then becomes necessary to deliver governance structures, through the considerations outlined above, that will ensure wide-spread engineering situational awareness so that the undesirable emergent behaviours that are a characteristic of complexity can be minimised.  5. Current/emerging gaps in critical areas for SoS design and operation  The workshop on Systems of Systems (DG INFSO, 2009) noted that:  Through the integration of private and public systems at all levels and scales there is the potential to offer improved societal impact. Societal impact may be direct or indirect, at the level of the indi- vidual or at larger scales; increasing efÔ¨Åciencies and producing new techniques and methods and approaches to working.  This statement reveals both the beneÔ¨Åts that investment in SoS research may realise and the risks and vulnerabilities that failure to invest may create. The highly, and increasingly, connected nature of modern society means that the existence of SoS is an unavoidable factor of modern life, driving the need for better techniques to analyse, design for, manage, and retire SoS and the individual sys- tems that contribute to SoS. In essence, the challenge is to predict and manage emergence of increasingly complex and complicated SoS. Gaps in knowledge of how to do this exist at all levels and scales and, importantly between levels and simultaneously at several scales. The knowledge gaps identiÔ¨Åed below (Barot et al., 2012; Henshaw et al., 2013) will require a co-ordinated effort of multi-disciplinary research in which ergonomics/human factors has a key role to play. In almost every case, successful research would lead to improved positive societal impact as well as avoiding negative impact. There is overlap between many of the areas identiÔ¨Åed below. The list of knowledge gaps is not exclusive and is presented as an initial input to the development of programmes. System IdentiÔ¨Åcation: The concept of system identiÔ¨Åcation is not well-deÔ¨Åned for Systems of Systems, and an obvious cause of  and  of, work:  distribution  Distributed,  unexpected (and generally undesirable) emergent behaviour is failure to correctly identify the system of interest by the system designers. This is an area for fundamental research in SoSE. Changes in the de- mographic of the EU workforce (e.g. aging workforce, changes in mobility, geographical wage differences) mean that it is likely that rather than taking workers to the work, increasingly the work will be taken to the workers. This is already addressed in the ICT domain, but other sectors will need to restructure to accommodate this. Action at a distance: As (Asaro, 2011) has pointed out, SoS allows for unethical and criminal behaviour at a distance from the per- petrators, especially when crossing legislative jurisdictions. This raises detection, regulatory and prosecutorial issues that need to be resolved (e.g. how is responsibility to be allocated?). This is espe- cially a challenge in the cyber domain. Information Security: Loss or corruption of information due to benign and malicious attacks on IT systems. The cost of conducting a cyber attack is very low, but the cost of protection is very high.  Assurance of  Intellectual Property Rights and competitive advan-  tage: Related to Information Security; a major problem for efÔ¨Å- ciency and efÔ¨Åcacy of large-scale SoS is the protection of information for commercial reasons. The result is that the SoS may operate under conditions of imperfect, incomplete information most of the time. There seems to be a requirement for better mechanisms to protect IPRs, etc., so that protagonists in a SoS feel more able to divulge information without material loss of competitive value. Distributed Risk: The interdependencies between component systems can lead to complex relationships in terms of risk owner- ship and liability. Furthermore, redistribution of risk because of SoS interdependencies may distort the market for future provision of products and services. Research is needed into the nature of risk ownership in SoS. Automation and autonomy: A SoS may have component systems that have no humans involved in their operations, and have a sig- niÔ¨Åcant degree of autonomy in decision-making, with direct effects on particular segments of society (e.g. robots for assisted living scenarios). Issues of safety, certiÔ¨Åcation, maintenance and re- sponsibility are raised.  Ethical behaviour of SoS:  In an environment in which partici- pants in a situation cannot fully comprehend the wider implica- tions of their actions and where SoS behaviours may be the emergent properties of many seemingly independent actions, the requirement for ethical behaviour on the part of all organisations and systems becomes imperative (Seidman, 2012). Safety of SoS operations: Action at a distance has strong impli- cations for safety. These range from different conceptions of safety in different jurisdictions, different expectations for the operational behaviour of SoS, different understanding of the risks of SoS operational behaviour, etc. A signiÔ¨Åcant theme in this problem is better understanding of how to create shared awareness. Governance and regulation: Given that many SoS are of critical importance for the safety and security of society (e.g. health, policing, emergency, etc.), their integrity and security of structure and operations is a paramount consideration (Maier, 2005). Appropriate internal governance systems and external regulatory oversight must be developed.  Invariant partial architectures for SoS (Maier, 2005): For most SoS,  it is believed that portions of their architecture will remain almost invariant over time, although other portions may be labile. It may be that there are commonalities over types of SoS for these invariant portions that will permit standardisation and operating efÔ¨Åciencies to be obtained. The potential beneÔ¨Åts indicate that this should be explored.  
96  C.E. Siemieniuch, M.A. Sinclair / Applied Ergonomics 45 (2014) 85e98  and  points‚Äô  ‚Äòtipping  Variability  (Tainter, 1996; Rudolph and Repenning, 2002; Maier, 2005): Theoretically, there are condi- tions under which SoS behaviour may collapse (a form of emergent behaviour). For example, there is the variability issue, where although the average rate of response of the SoS is within design limits, there may be occasions where the required rate is beyond these limits and the SoS fails catastrophically. This latter condition may arise because of the extent and complexity of the SoS itself, which inadvertently builds in rigidities that result in collapse as the only available behaviour of the SoS. As the ‚ÄòInternet of things‚Äô be- comes a reality, and as governments interlink their services, the possibility of collapse becomes ever more critical, and requires better understanding of its characteristics.  Problems of distributed intelligence in SoS: Although distributed  intelligence within SoS is a desirable goal for effective, efÔ¨Åcient and speedy response to local conditions, there are potential problems when conÔ¨Çicting plans are developed dynamically. While these issues are well understood for Directed SoS (Dahmann and Baldwin, 2008), the solutions for other classes of SoS are less obvious, and need development. While there is always the option of legal redress, it is not the best solution to the problem.  Tools and techniques for understanding, designing and upgrading SoS behaviour.  In particular, there is a severe lack of easy-to-use, effective and efÔ¨Åcient tools that convey easy-to-understand meaning for tool users faced with some particular class of SoS problem. This should be addressed as a matter of urgency, and some of the necessary classes of tools are identiÔ¨Åed in the conclusion to this paper. Knowledge and skills gaps: Many authors have stated that (a) SoS engineering is a multi-disciplinary exercise, and (b) has the char- acteristics of a ‚Äòwicked problem‚Äô (Rittel and Webber, 1973; Daw, 2007). The creation and management of component systems within SoS requires a workforce with appropriate systems skills and knowledge, requiring training programmes in SoS engineering (Sousa-Poza et al., 2008). Research is required to help deÔ¨Åne the training and education needed to equip the EU workforce for future SoS challenges.  6. A re-assessment of the SoS approach and of OSoSE  It is time to stand back and consider both the social beneÔ¨Åts and the endemic difÔ¨Åculties of the SoS approach. As was said earlier, the increasingly inter-connected nature of modern society means that the existence of SoS is an unavoidable factor of modern life, driving the need for better techniques to analyse, design for, manage, and retire SoS and the individual systems that contribute to SoS. It is hoped that the examples discussed brieÔ¨Çy in this paper demon- strate this. However, looking to the future, perhaps there is a more important reason for adopting this approach; in addressing the ‚ÄòGlobal Drivers‚Äô.  6.1.  SoS and the global drivers  A number of signiÔ¨Åcant reports (Wilbanks et al., 2007; UN-FAO, 2009; Halonen and Zuma, 2012; Sulston, 2012; World-Bank, 2012) have pointed to a collection of inter-related, interoperating, global drivers that by about 2050 will signiÔ¨Åcantly affect the world pop- ulation. A list of these includes:   Population demographics (growth, migration and aging)  Food security (including water security)  Energy security  Resource depletion (including utilisation and re-utilisation)  Emissions and global climate  security   Community security)  Transportation  Globalisation of economic and social activity  safety  and  (including  information  Taken together, these drivers imply a ‚Äòperfect storm‚Äô of change over the next 50 years and beyond. Since most citizens of the world live in urban environments, and it is in urban environments where most wealth generation happens, the impact of these drivers on the urban environment is of major interest (and given the dependence of the urban environment on the rural environment, the latter will be entrained as well; it cannot be ignored). Consequently, since these drivers are already having an effect, it is of major importance to have a deep understanding of the required change processes to accommodate these drivers, the risks that will be faced as the ac- commodation is developed, the level of resilience that is required and the resources that must be made available. It is immediately obvious that if the global drivers are inter- related, then they must be addressed cohesively and coherently, while recognising the legacy infrastructures and systems that already exist in the urban environment. This is best achieved by the ‚Äòsmart city‚Äô paradigm (Batty et al., 2012), deÔ¨Åned as ‚Äúa city in which ICT is merged with traditional infrastructures, co-ordinated and integrated using new digital technologies‚Äù, and by the adoption of a ‚Äòsystem of systems‚Äô approach. It is clear that a co-ordinated approach is necessary. Indeed, systems of systems thinking is needed at every level from the high level public services that must be developed down to much more compact systems of systems upon which the public services depend, and which will underpin other systemic developments as the need for them emerges in the future. Since it will not be public services alone that will provide solutions to the problems that the global drivers will present, there will be heavy reliance on private, mainly civilian SoS too, created and run for a proÔ¨Åt, but with the capital resources to develop, implement and manage these SoS. It should be noted that one of the strengths of SoSE approach is the emphasis on resilience, agility and emergence; essential qualities for the complex, potentially dangerous, future before us. The drivers outlined above must be addressed in such a way that the bad effects of the global drivers are either mitigated or, indeed, reversed.  6.2. Drawbacks  There are several, many of which are described brieÔ¨Çy in section 5 above. These are easily identiÔ¨Åed; there are some others, only now becoming visible. Most of these concern the socio-technical aspects of SoS. We discuss these below.  Assurance of appropriate understanding. This is a complex issue,  arising from the inherent complexity, data lacunae, and the non- linearity and the endless, continuous data Ô¨Çows of SoS opera- tions, added to the requirement for appropriate data condensing tools to deliver information to human decision-makers, together with the varied knowledge status of those people making decision regarding the SoS. It may be possible to create tools and sufÔ¨Åcient AI-based interpretation tools to compress the information sufÔ¨Å- ciently in real time to be able to present a coherent, valid picture of the SoS, but it is the quality of the resulting human decisions that will determine the future of the SoS and the people affected by it.  Decision-making on behalf of individuals. As a consequence of the  data compression above, it is likely that the decisions made will be at the level of larger groups. However, the quality of life as perceived by humans is an individual issue, and is based on a unique assimilation of the experiences of life as affected by the SoS with which the individual comes into contact. If we have as our goal  
C.E. Siemieniuch, M.A. Sinclair / Applied Ergonomics 45 (2014) 85e98  97  the improvement of human well-being, then decisions at the group level may not be adequate. Perhaps sufÔ¨Åciently-intelligent AI sys- tems could deconstruct these group decisions to deliver individual beneÔ¨Åt for individuals within the group, but this remains to be demonstrated.  Overarching co-ordination mechanisms. It is readily apparent that  social  ConÔ¨Çicting  perceptions. As  in the political world, the creation of supra-national co-ordination is a very difÔ¨Åcult goal to achieve. As the mega-conferences on the global drivers held successively at Kyoto, Doha and Rio have demonstrated, agreement on goals is difÔ¨Åcult, and agreement on global, co-ordinated processes and governance has yet to appear. the political world demon- strates regularly, and as criminal statistics show, there is a wide variety of human opinion on what to do at any given instance. It is not obvious how any large-scale SoS can deal with these conÔ¨Çicting social perceptions and associated mental models. In short, the technical drawbacks to the SoS approach are serious, but probably solvable. The authors take comfort in this from the words of a senior aeronautics engineer: ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt have technical problems; if we throw enough good people and enough money at a problem, it will disappear.‚Äù However, the second part of this quotation also points to the more long-lasting difÔ¨Åculties with the SoS paradigm that may not go away: ‚ÄúNo; our problems are always the people‚Äù. It is the ethical, cultural and societal issues that may linger and degrade the SoS approach.  7.  Conclusion  This paper has addressed a number of socio-technical issues to do with the real world operations of SoS: some of these are not often discussed in the SoS literature and in ergonomics/human factors journals. The drivers of the solutions are fairly well-known and the organisational antecedents that must be in place for these drivers to be effective are also well known; the problem is that we lack appropriate tools to arrive at good solutions to the conÔ¨Ågura- tion, operation and control of SoS and their interfaces. The sort of tools which are required include:   Tools for modelling and visualisation of the organisational systems within an SoS (typically known as Enterprise Archi- tecture and Modelling Tools) to identify patterns and to explore  Simulation tools to run models separately and together.

This paper began by setting the SoS context as perceived by the authors and the main differences in approach between Systems Engineering and SoS Engineering. The discussion in the paper was then deliberately restricted to issues surrounding the top 5 levels in the NCOIC Interoperability Framework (while recognising the fundamental importance of the other levels). The impact of  complexity on the design and operation of organisational systems within an SoS was followed by a brief overview of possible ap- proaches to dealing with complexity and resilience in SoS socio- technical systems and the characterisation of these approaches as a wicked problem. Within this characterisation the authors attempted to identify how aspects of the ‚Äòwicked problem‚Äô para- digm are manifested in SoS and suggest a range of techniques that could be applied to address them. However one chooses to approach the problem there will al- ways be a requirement for technical and engineering governance, set within an overall corporate governance framework e this is addressed in section 4. To Ô¨Ånish the paper the authors have iden- tiÔ¨Åed an initial set of key current and emerging knowledge gaps in the area of SoS design and operation and the need for an integrated set of tools to address the socio-technical issues identiÔ¨Åed in this paper, and have included some higher-level issues about the uti- lisation of SoS; their appropriateness to address the problems of Global Drivers, and the sociotechnical problems in understanding what they are doing. Finally it would seem clear from the points made in this paper that the creation of dynamic short and long life-cycle SoS that comprise partnerships of organisational systems will require changes to the individual organisation system structures and pro- cesses. This is turn will require different people and resources perhaps from a broader spectrum of national, organisational and professional cultures, including a wider pool of available and accessible knowledge. As Einstein said in 1946,  ‚ÄúThe world we have created is a product of our thinking; it cannot be changed without changing our thinking.‚Äù  It is hoped that this paper makes some contribution in this important but difÔ¨Åcult area and encourages ergonomics/human factors professionals to enter into the discussion.  "
s0003687013000604,"  The human factors and ergonomics of Ô¨Çight simulators have long been studied in terms of the impacts of simulator Ô¨Ådelity, simulator sickness, and so on. Much has been learned about humans‚Äô visual and vestibular systems, leading to basic insights into human behavior and performance. This research has also led to simulator design improvements. More recently, the Ô¨Çight simulator concept has been invoked to capture the essence of how interactive organizational simulations can be used to ‚ÄúÔ¨Çy the future before you write the check.‚Äù The idea is for organizational leaders to be able to interactively explore alter- native organizational designs computationally rather than physi- cally. Such explorations allow rapid consideration of many alternatives, perhaps as a key step in developing a vision for trans- forming an enterprise. Computational modeling of organizations has a rich history in terms of both research and practice (Prietula et al., 1998; Carley, 2002; Rouse and Boff, 2005). This approach has achieved credi- bility in organization science (Burton, 2003; Burton and Obel, 2011). It is also commonly used by the military. Simulation of physics-based systems has long been in common use, but the simulation of behavioral and social phenomena has only matured in the past decade or so. It is of particular value for exploring alternative organizational concepts that do not yet exist and, hence, cannot be explored empirically. The transformation of health delivery is, for example, a prime candidate for exploration via organizational simulation (Basole et al., in press). This article focuses on the nature of how people interact with Ô¨Çight simulators that are designed for the purpose of exploring alternative management policies at levels ranging from individ- ual organizations to national strategy. Often, the organizations of  interest are best characterized as complex adaptive systems, and modeled using multi-level representations. The interactions with simulators of such complex systems almost always involve groups of people rather than individuals, often with different stakeholders in conÔ¨Çict about priorities and courses of action. In this article, the ways in which these interactions are framed and conducted are discussed, as well as the nature of typical results.  2.  Complex adaptive systems  Many people attempt to think about organizational systems in terms of exemplars ranging from vehicles (e.g., airplanes), to process plants (e.g., utilities), to infrastructure (e.g., airports), to enterprises (e.g., Wal-Mart). They often think in terms of decomposing the overall problem of system performance and management into component elements (e.g., propulsion, suspension, electronics, etc.) and, subsequently recomposing the designed solution for each element into an overall system design. This approach to hierarchical decomposition (Rouse, 2003) has worked well to provide us automobiles, highways, laptops, cell phones, and the ability to buy products from anywhere in the world at attractive prices. Success, however, has depended on the ability to decompose and recompose the elements of the system and, of particular importance, the authority and resources to accomplish this work. Not all system design and management problems can be addressed this way. One problem is that the decomposition may result in losing important information resulting from interactions among the phenomena of interest. Another very fundamental problem is that there may be no one ‚Äúin charge,‚Äù with the authority and resources to pursue this work.

W.B. Rouse / Applied Ergonomics 45 (2014) 72e77  73  Consider the architecture of public-private enterprises shown in Fig. 1 (Rouse, 2009; Rouse and Cortese, 2010; Grossman et al., 2011). The efÔ¨Åciencies that can be gained at the lowest level (work prac- tices) are limited by nature of the next level (delivery operations). Work can only be accomplished within the capacities provided by available processes. Further, delivery organized around processes tends to result in much more efÔ¨Åcient work practices than for functionally organized business operations. However, the efÔ¨Åciencies that can be gained from improved operations are limited by the nature of the level above, i.e., system structure. Functional operations are often driven by organizations structured around these functions, e.g., manufacturing and service. Each of these organizations may be a different business with in- dependent economic objectives. This may signiÔ¨Åcantly hinder process-oriented thinking. And, of course, potential efÔ¨Åciencies in system structure are limited by the ecosystem in which these organizations operate. Market maturity, economic conditions, and government regula- tions will affect the capacities (processes) that businesses (orga- nizations) are willing to invest in to enable work practices (people), whether these people be employees, customers, or constituencies in general. Economic considerations play a major role at this level (Rouse, 2010a,b). These organizational realities have long been recognized by researchers in socio-technical systems (Emery and Trist, 1973), as well as work design and system ergonomics (Hendrick and Kleiner, 2001). The contribution of the research reported in this article is the enablement of computational explorations of these realities, especially by stakeholders without deep disciplinary expertise in these phenomena.  4.  Example policy Ô¨Çight simulator  Developing multi-level models of large-scale public-private enterprises is a challenge in itself. Getting decision makers and other stakeholders to employ these models to inform their dis- cussions and decisions is yet a greater challenge. We have found that interactive simulation models can provide the means to meeting this challenge. The decision makers with whom we have  represent a class of design and management problems that tend to have these limitations.1 Complex adaptive systems can be deÔ¨Åned in terms of characteristics (Rouse, 2000, 2008):  their   They are nonlinear, dynamic and do not inherently reach Ô¨Åxed equilibrium points. The resulting system behaviors may appear to be random or chaotic.  They are composed of independent agents whose behavior can be described as based on physical, psychological, or social rules, rather than being completely dictated by the dynamics of the system.  Agents‚Äô needs or desires, reÔ¨Çected in their rules, are not ho-  mogenous and, therefore, their goals and behaviors are likely to  conÔ¨Çict e these conÔ¨Çicts or competitions tend to lead agents to adapt to each other‚Äôs behaviors.  Agents are intelligent, and learn as they experiment and gain experience, and change behaviors accordingly. Thus, overall systems behavior inherently changes over time.  Adaptation and learning tends to result and patterns of behavior that emerge rather than being designed into the system. The nature of such emergent be- haviors may range from valuable innovations to unfortunate accidents.  There is no single point(s) of control e systems behaviors are often unpredictable and uncontrollable, and no one is ‚Äúin charge.‚Äù Consequently, the behaviors of complex adaptive systems usually can be inÔ¨Çuenced more than they can be controlled.  in self-organizing  There are important implications for transforming organiza- tional systems that have these characteristics. One cannot, using any conventional means, command or force such systems to comply with behavioral and performance dictates. The agents in such systems are sufÔ¨Åciently intelligent to game the system, Ô¨Ånd workarounds, and creatively identify ways to serve their own in- terests, e.g., their mandated or perceived entitlements. Two overarching competencies enable leading successful transformation of enterprises e vision and leadership (Rouse, 2011). In complex adaptive systems, however, the leader cannot impose the vision of the transformed enterprise. This article shows how policy Ô¨Çight simulators can allow key stakeholders to ‚Äúdrive the future‚Äù before they commit to it. While there is a range of implementation challenges that follow such commitments (Rouse, 1996, 2001, 2006), especially the risk of being derailed by organi- zations delusions (Rouse, 1998a), this paper focuses solely on elaboration and exploration of alternative visions of the trans- formed enterprise.  3. Multi-level modeling  To develop policy Ô¨Çight simulators, we need to computationally model the functioning of the complex adaptive system of interest to enable decision makers, as well as other signiÔ¨Åcant stakeholders, to explore the possibilities and implications of transforming these enterprise systems in fundamental ways. The goal is to create organizational simulations that will serve as policy Ô¨Çight simula- tors for interactive exploration by teams of often disparate stake- holders who have inherent conÔ¨Çicts, but need and desire an agreed upon way forward (Rouse and Boff, 2005).  1  In recent years, such systems have also been characterized as ‚Äúsystems of systems,‚Äù particularly by those associated with the U.S. Department of Defense. This concept, as originally framed by Ackoff (1971), certainly has its merits.  Fig. 1. Architecture of public private enterprises.  
74  W.B. Rouse / Applied Ergonomics 45 (2014) 72e77  worked have found that the phrase ‚Äúpolicy Ô¨Çight simulator‚Äù makes sense to them. Multi-level simulations can provide the means to explore a wide range of possibilities, thereby enabling the early discarding of bad ideas and reÔ¨Ånement of good ones. This enables driving the future before writing the check. One would never develop and deploy an airplane without Ô¨Årst simulating its behavior and performance. However, this happens all too often in enterprise systems in terms of policies, strategies, plans, and management practices that are rolled out with little, if any, consideration of higher-order and un- intended consequences. This policy Ô¨Çight simulator focused on the Predictive Health Institute (PHI), a joint initiative of Emory University and Georgia Institute of Technology (Brigham, 2010; Rask et al., 2011). PHI is a health-focused facility that counsels essentially healthy people on diet, weight, activity, and stress management. The multi-level model focused on the roughly 700 people in PHI‚Äôs cohort and their risks of type 2 diabetes (DM) and coronary heart disease (CHD). We calculated every person‚Äôs risk of each disease using well accepted risk models based on national data sets (Wilson et al., 1998, 2007), using PHI‚Äôs initial individual assessments of blood pressure, fasting glucose level, etc. for each participant. Subsequent assessment data were used to estimate annual risk changes as a function of initial risks of each disease. The four-level model of Fig. 1 was implemented as a multi-level simulation. Separate displays were created to portray the operation of each level of the model. Runs of the multi-level simulation were set up using the dashboard in Fig. 2. The top section of the dash- board allows decision makers to test different combinations of policies from the perspective of Human Resources (HR). For instance, this level determines the allocation of payment to PHI based on a hybrid capitated or pay-for-outcome formula. It also involves choices of parameters such as projected healthcare  inÔ¨Çation rate, general economy inÔ¨Çation rate, and discount rate that affect the economic valuation of the outcomes of PHI‚Äôs prevention and wellness program. One of the greatest concerns of HR is achieving a satisfactory Return on Investment (ROI) on any in- vestments in prevention and wellness. Note that the notion of payer is different in the U.S. than in most other developed countries. The payer for the majority of people covered by health insurance in the U.S. is their employer. Payment is usually managed by the HR function in companies, often with assistance from the private insurance company that administers the company‚Äôs plan. Companies are almost always concerned that healthcare expenditures are well managed and provide ‚Äúreturns‚Äù in terms of the well being of employees and their families, as well as the performance of employees in their jobs (Rouse, 2010b). The concerns of PHI are represented in the lower section of the dashboard. These concerns include the organization‚Äôs economic sustainability e their revenue must be equal to or greater than their costs. To achieve sustainability, PHI must appropriately design its operational processes and rules. Two issues are central. What risk levels should be used to stratify the participant population? What assessment and coaching processes should be employed for each strata of the population? Other considerations at this level include the growth rate of the participant population, the age ranges tar- geted for growth, and the program duration before participants are moved to ‚Äúmaintenance.‚Äù Decision makers can also decide what data source to employ to parameterize the models e either data from the American Diabetes Association (ADA) and American Heart Association (AHA), or data speciÔ¨Åc to Emory employees. Decision makers can choose to only count savings until age 65 or also project post-retirement savings. This policy Ô¨Çight simulator was used to explore two scenarios: 1) capitated payment for services and, 2) payment for outcomes. Hybrids of these scenarios were also investigated (Park et al., 2012).  Fig. 2. Simulator dashboard for prevention and wellness.  
W.B. Rouse / Applied Ergonomics 45 (2014) 72e77  75  The goal was to understand the inÔ¨Çuence of capitation and pay-for- outcome levels on economic outcomes for both payer (HR) and provider (PHI). Fig. 3 illustrates the effects of these two variables. Since PHI delivers the same service to all volunteers, a pure capi- tated payment is essentially a fee for service. PHI can be very proÔ¨Åtable if the capitated payment is sufÔ¨Åciently large. On the other hand, PHI does only modestly well by comparison under a payment for outcomes system, in large part because it‚Äôs population is not pre-screened for people at risk. Emory HR‚Äôs results are virtually opposite, although it can still do relatively well under the right blend of capitation and pay for outcome. Fig. 3 presents the aggregate results for Emory as a whole and, in some sense, is a surrogate for ‚Äúsociety‚Äù and its overall gain under various health care payment systems. Here the results are far less intuitive and, in fact, a typical negotiation that Ô¨Ånds middle ground, e.g., by splitting the difference between HR and PHI, would not achieve anything close to the maximum potential overall so- cietal gain. In other words, when we compromise between the returns to HR and PHI, the aggregate returns to Emory are minimized. The best economic results are achieved when either PHI‚Äôs proÔ¨Åt is maximized or Emory HR‚Äôs ROI is maximized. There are a variety of reasons why one might choose either extreme. However, another possibility emerged from discussions while using the policy Ô¨Çight simulator. HR could maximize its ROI while providing PHI a very lean budget. At the end of each year, HR could then provide PHI with a bonus for the actual savings experienced that year. This could be determined by comparing the projected costs for the people in the program to their actual costs of health care, absenteeism and pre- senteeism. In this way, HR would be sharing actual savings rather than projected savings. The annual bonuses would free PHI of the fear of not being sustainable, although PHI would need to sub- stantially reorganize its delivery system to stratify participants by risk levels and tailor processes to each stratum. This policy Ô¨Çight simulator was used to explore a wide range of other issues such as the best levels of participant risk stratiÔ¨Åcation and the impacts of inÔ¨Çation and discount rates. The key insight for  PHI management was that they needed to redesign their processes and decision rules if they were going to provide a good return to HR and stay in business. They learned how best to redesign their of- ferings using the policy Ô¨Çight simulator. Now they are getting ready for Ô¨Çight tests.  5. People‚Äôs use of simulators  There are eight tasks associated with creating and using policy Ô¨Çight simulators:  the ap-  for and   Agreeing on objectives e the questions e for which the simu- lator will be constructed.  Formulating the multi-level model e the engine simulator e including alternative representations proaches to parameterization.  Designing a humanecomputer interface that includes rich vi- sualizations and associated controls for specifying scenarios.  Iteratively developing, testing and debugging, including iden- tifying faulty thinking in formulating the model.  Interactively exploring the impacts of ranges of parameters and consequences of various scenarios.  Agreeing on rules for eliminating solutions that do not make sense for one or more stakeholders.  DeÔ¨Åning the parameter surfaces of runs to map these surfaces.  Agreeing on feasible solutions and the beneÔ¨Åts of each feasible solution.  interest and ‚Äúproduction‚Äù  relative merits  and  The discussions associated with performing the above tasks tend to be quite rich. Initial interactions focus on agreeing on ob- jectives, which includes output measures of interest, including units of measure. This often unearths differing perspectives among stakeholders. Attention then moves to discussions of the phenomena affecting the measures of interest, including relationships among phenom- ena. Component models are needed for these phenomena and agreeing on suitable vetted, and hopefully off-the-shelf, models  Fig. 3. Net economic value as a function of payment model.  
76  W.B. Rouse / Applied Ergonomics 45 (2014) 72e77  importance are uncertainties including both structural and  occurs at this time. Also of great associated with these phenomena, parametric uncertainties. As computational versions of models are developed and demonstrated, discussions center on the extent to which model responses are aligned with expectations. The overall goal is to computationally redesign the enterprise. However, the initial goal is usually to replicate the existing organization to see if the model predicts the results actually being currently achieved. Once attention shifts to redesign, discussion inevitably shifts to the question of how to validate the model‚Äôs predictions. As these predictions inherently concern organizational systems that do not yet exist, validation is limited to discussing the believability of the insights emerging from debates about the nature and causes of model outputs. In some cases, deÔ¨Åciencies of the models will be uncovered, but occasionally unexpected higher-order and unin- tended consequences make complete sense and become issues of serious discussion. Model-based policy Ô¨Çight simulators are often used to explore a wide range of ideas. It is quite common for one or more stake- holders to have bright ideas that have substantially negative con- sequences. People typically tee up many alternative organizational designs, interactively explore their consequences, and develop criteria for the goodness of an idea. A common criterion is that no major stakeholder can lose in a substantial way. For the Emory simulator, this rule pared the feasible set from hundreds of thou- sands of conÔ¨Ågurations to a few hundred. Quite often, people discover the key variables most affecting the measures of primary interest. They then can use the simulator in a ‚Äúproduction mode,‚Äù without the graphical user interface, to rapidly simulate ranges of variables to produce surface plots such as shown in Fig. 3. The simulator runs to create this plot were done without the user interface of Fig. 2. Discussions of such surface plots, as well as other results, pro- vide the basis for agreeing on pilot tests of apparently good ideas. Such tests are used to empirically conÔ¨Årm the simulator‚Äôs pre- dictions, much as Ô¨Çight tests are used to conÔ¨Årm that an aircraft‚Äôs performance is similar to that predicted when the plane was designed ‚Äúin silico.‚Äù Policy Ô¨Çight simulators serve as boundary spanning mecha- nisms, across domains, disciplines and beyond initial problem formulations, which are all too often more tightly bounded than warranted. Such boundary spanning results in arguments among stakeholders being externalized. The alternative perspectives are represented by the assumptions underlying and the elements that compose the graphically depicted model projected on the large screen. The debate then focuses on the screen rather than being an argument between two or more people across a table. The observations in this section are well aligned with Rouse‚Äôs (1998b) Ô¨Åndings concerning what teams seek from computer- based tools for planning and design:   Teams want a clear and straightforward process to guide their decisions and discussions, with a clear mandate to depart from this process whenever they choose.  Teams want capture of information compiled, decisions made, and linkages between these inputs and outputs so that they can communicate and justify their decisions, as well as reconstruct decision processes.  Teams want computer-aided facilitation of group processes via management of the nominal decision making process using computer-based tools and large screen displays.  Teams want tools that digest the information that they input, see patterns or trends, and then provide advice or guidance  that the group perceives without the tools.  they would not have  thought of  Policy Ô¨Çight simulators do not yet fully satisfy all these objectives, but they are headed in this direction. It is useful to note that the process outlined in this section is inherently a participatory design process (Schuler and Namioka, 1993). This human-centered process considers and balances all stakeholders‚Äô concerns, values and perceptions (Rouse, 2007). The result is a better solution and, just as important, an acceptable solution.  6.  Conclusions  This article has discussed policy Ô¨Çight simulators that are designed for the purpose of exploring alternative management policies at levels ranging from individual organizations to national strategy. The focus was on both how such simulators are developed and on the nature of how people interact with these simulators. These interactions almost always involve groups of people rather than individuals, often with different stakeholders in conÔ¨Çict about priorities and courses of action. The ways in which these in- teractions are framed and conducted were discussed, as well as the nature of typical results. Current policy Ô¨Åght simulator projects include:   Chronic disease management at Vanderbilt University Medical Center e the focus is on scaling this successful program to millions of participants.  Secure communications for the Department of Defense e the focus in on alternative polices and technology strategies for securing communications.  Counterfeit parts in electronics and semiconductor supply chains e the focus is on both interdicting the intention to counterfeit and understand the operational implications of counterfeit parts being deployed in systems.  All of these projects are pursuing the eight tasks elaborated earlier and involve the types of discussions and debates outlined above.  References  through organiza-  Ackoff, R.L., 1971.

s0003687013000628,"  There should be few researchers or practitioners in ergonomics/ human factors (E/HF) who do not think of it being a systems discipline, and of themselves as taking a systems-oriented perspective. However, long acceptance that to be meaningful (E/ HF) is systems-oriented does not mean that there are widely accepted explanations of exactly what this means in principle and in practice (although see Siemieniuch and Sinclair, 2006; Waterson, 2009a for instance). This paper is written to redress, to an extent, this vacuum in E/HF thinking. At the outset it should be said that, to avoid sterile debate and any implications that ergonomics has to do with one kind of system and human factors another, and to avoid the complications of any confusion between ergonomics/human factors systems thinking and human systems integration or human factors integration (ref), the term ergonomics/human factors and the abbreviation E/HF will be used throughout, denoting the single nature of the discipline. Many of the early leaders in E/HF (Chapanis, Corlett, Singleton) saw it clearly as a systems discipline (e.g. Singleton, 1974 in a short but prescient book). Several leading authorities such as Sheridan (2013) and Sheridan and Ferrell (1981), Rouse (2007, 2013) and Rasmussen (1997) actually came into E/HF from a control and systems engineering background, and worked with many people from control engineering who brought systems-level models with them. Many examples of the work of others from this background can be seen in the proceedings of the periodic [hu]manemachine systems IFAC/IFIP/IFORS/IEA conferences of the 1980s and related  E-mail address:  john.wilson@nottingham.ac.uk.  0003-6870/$ e see front matter √ì 2013 Published by Elsevier Ltd. http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2013.03.021  NATO workshops on human control of systems and decision mak- ing (e.g. Hollnagel et al., 1985). Their interest in human capability and fallibility, when it became clear that apparently advanced process control systems would fail if these induced errors in op- erators and managers (and actually needed human expertise to work properly), spawned a movement in cognitive systems engi- neering and subsequently joint cognitive systems (Hollnagel and Woods, 2005; Woods and Hollnagel, 2006). It is not surprising that there is a systems design orientation to the work of those mentioned above, and many others in E/HF, since they were usually dealing with large and complex systems, with many interacting components, and where the cognitive interactions are intimately related to the physical ones through positioning and layout of in- formation displays for instance and the social (communications, co- ordination and collaboration with others). However, even within the classical ergonomics applied to industrial workplaces, physical work, and manual handling, and to devices and equipment used within them, leading ergonomists worldwide have clearly seen that we can only usefully address the relevant human factors concerns at a systems level, whether we call it systems ergonomics, or participatory ergonomics/design (Haines et al., 2002) or, as has become prevalent in North America at least, macroergonomics (Hendrick and Kleiner, 2001; Kleiner, 2006). Even with all this support for the primacy, indeed necessity, of a systems view, in some areas of ergonomics application it some- times seems that a single problem-single solution ethos still pre- vails (see Dul et al., 2012). My own work, as joint editor-in-chief of Applied Ergonomics and as an editor or board member for several other journals exposes me to reports of some E/HF which, far from actually analysing or investigating at a system-level, does not even acknowledge the importance of context, which inÔ¨Çuences the  
6  J.R. Wilson / Applied Ergonomics 45 (2014) 5e13  interactions between the researchers‚Äô focus and other parts of the system in practice. This may be for a number of reasons. Most acceptably, this may be because of the impracticality in some circumstance, given project or investigation remits and resources, to do more than concentrate upon a micro view of the human factors involved. A recent quote from a project team I audited was e ‚Äúyes we know there are larger systems issues which are relevant but we only have time, permission and access to address this small part of the problem‚Äù. Less acceptable are those cases where a narrow non-systems approach is taken because the investigators concerned are only competent or interested in a narrow channel of E/HF; the manual handling charlatans of a few years ago come to mind. It is tempting to be hard-nosed and suggest that any study, investigation, analysis or development which does not take a sys- tems view is, in fact, not E/HF at all. Rather such an initiative should be seen as a sub-set of E/HF, a biomechanical, cognitive psychology or physiology study, and possibly of limited practical value. So, a musculoskeletal disorders (MSD) investigation or improvement which does not account for psychological/emotional/social in- Ô¨Çuences, on MSD causation or success of solutions, is not properly E/HF. Likewise, any experimental study which assumes that cognitive task performance occurs in a vacuum away from emotional, motivational, supervisory and environmental inÔ¨Çuences and impacts means that Ô¨Åndings have less value. Taking such a hard-nosed position might be too extreme for some, but such a stance does start to more clearly delineate what is our discipline and what it is not. Why write this paper at this time, and indeed why is this special issue appearing now? Well, if the world of E/HF is to have a future then we have to accept that it is a systems discipline and that, to paraphrase Hal Hendrick, good ergonomics is systems ergonomics. However, it is all very well to espouse the systems viewpoint and approach but we need to be clearer what we mean. This paper, based on an earlier and shorter version published in the pro- ceedings of the IEA Triennial Congress 2012 (Wilson, 2012), brings together ideas from earlier efforts (e.g. Moray, 2000; Wilson, 2000), other sources from outside our discipline, and practical experience in different industries to move beyond the easy statement of E/HF as a systems discipline and to try to exemplify what we mean by this. In the next section the relationship between systems E/HF and systems engineering is explored. Following this, the heart of the paper is two sections the Ô¨Årst of which deÔ¨Ånes the fundamentals and components of systems E/HF and the second provides exam- ples for each through research and practice in rail systems E/HF over a number of years.  2.  Systems engineering and systems E/HF  So, what is systems ergonomics (or systems human factors)? A deceptively easy deÔ¨Ånition, if somewhat circular, is that systems ergonomics examines, accounts for and enhances the design of a system, and people‚Äôs interactions with it, rather than concentrating on an individual part of it. That system can be an artefact, facility, environment, building, work site, group, community, organization or society. This deÔ¨Ånition immediately begs the question of: what is a system? If we agree that the notion of systems E/HF is key to the ergonomics/human factors profession, then we need to understand what is agreed, or not, about ‚Äúsystem‚Äù (and by extension ‚Äúsystems engineering‚Äù). Singleton (1974) proposed that systems had related objects, changed over time and, for human-made systems, have a purpose (people nowadays from other sciences might argue with his contention that natural systems do not have a purpose or goal). From a central position within E/HF, Chapanis (1996) noted that the  term ‚Äúsystems‚Äù is used in many ways but he concentrated on what he calls ‚Äúequipment systems‚Äù, deÔ¨Åned as ‚Äúan interacting combi- nation, at any level of complexity, of people, materials, tools, ma- chines, software, facilities, and procedures designed to work together for some common purpose.‚Äù (p. 20). Extending the idea of a system as an organized whole, the interdependent components can only be deÔ¨Åned in relation to one another depending on their place inside this whole (Luzeaux and Ruault, 2008, p. 12, quoting de Saussure), and the technical and human components, and their attributes and relationships, are addressed towards a goal (Stasinopoulos et al., 2009). So a motor car is a system whereas a selection of car parts on a shelf is not; a book is not a system but a reader with a book is a system. So, based on these earlier deÔ¨Ånitions, at the outset of this paper it is proposed that:  A system is a set of inter-related or coupled activities or entities (hardware, software, buildings, spaces, communities and peo- ple), with a joint purpose, links between the entities which may be of state, form, function and causation, and which changes and modiÔ¨Åes its state and the interactions within it given circum- stances and events, and which is conceptualised as existing within a boundary; it has inputs and outputs which may con- nect in many-to-many mappings; and with a bow to the Gestalt, the whole is usually greater (more useful, powerful, functional etc) than the sum of the parts.  Any understanding of systems ergonomics must be related to the idea of systems engineering. And it is here that we have another problem because of the variety of viewpoints and opinions avail- able e not an unusual situation! From the general world of systems analysis and design rather than E/HF, Blanchard and Fabrycky (2011) accept that there is no commonly accepted deÔ¨Ånition of systems engineering. They identify Ô¨Åve different deÔ¨Ånitions which, they say, show the variations in viewpoint (p. 31) but do suggest systems engineering features as: topedown approach; life-cycle orientation; early concentration on deÔ¨Åning systems re- quirements; and an inter-disciplinary or team-based approach in the development process. The increasingly strong contribution of human factors within systems engineering is shown in modern textbooks on systems analysis and design which these days have whole chapters on this (e.g. Blanchard and Fabrycky, 2011; Luzeaux and Ruault, 2008) e although unfortunately these sources do report a fairly old-fashioned view on ergonomics/human factors. Rouse (2010) sees human system integration (HIS) as an element of systems engineering concerned with understanding, designing and supporting human roles and performance in com- plex systems. Chapanis (1996) provides a selection of deÔ¨Ånitions of systems engineering which tends towards ones which, with small changes, might also deÔ¨Åne a design-oriented human factors. He also suggested that, at that time, debate over the nature of systems engineering was not settled, but preferred a deÔ¨Ånition that involves understanding of (evolving) user needs, and incremental devel- opment of requirements and speciÔ¨Åcations. He also suggests that systems engineering includes integration of all disciplines throughout the system life cycle so as to assure that all user re- quirements are satisÔ¨Åed (which starts to sound like the modern approach in large infrastructure projects of Human Factors Integration). The antithesis of a systems approach to development was seen clearly in a recent proposal for a major international project reviewed and evaluated by the author. In this, some very clever use of future mobile and ubiquitous technology and wireless networks was proposed, in order to create a citizen participant movement for sensing environmental traces and communicating these to cen- tralised databases and knowledge management systems. The

But, no mention was made of issues such as motivation, privacy, acceptability to local government, unintended consequences of third parties using the information for commercial purposes etc. OK, so they had forgotten, or just not recognised, the human factors issues, and we are used to that from (some) systems developers. But they also made no mention of equipment robustness, maintainability, bat- tery life, replacement policy, spares availability, integration with other local and national community systems, and so on. In other words, there appeared to be little or no systems thinking within the proposal.  3. Notions in systems E/HF  The main aim of this paper is to establish a framework of what is included, even necessary in systems E/HF. The case made in this paper is that there are six overlapping deÔ¨Åning features e systems focus, context, interactions (including complexity), holism, emer- gence and embedding e each of which will be explored in general in this section and then examples given from rail E/HF in the next section.  3.1.  Systems focus  The Ô¨Årst component of systems E/HF may seem blindingly obvious, indeed even trivial, but needs stating all the same. That is, systems E/HF treats the focus of interest as a system e as an interacting combination of DNA, materials (organic and inorganic), bytes, functions/processes and ideas. These combinations may not be stable, indeed where systems are complex they will not, nor should, be stable as recognized by the resilience engineering movement, and our focus is on the inter-connections as much or more than the components. Our systems of interest used to be limited to human- (or man-) made at one time, but now we also have an interest in the investigation and ‚Äúdesign‚Äù of people‚Äôs interaction with or within natural systems if not design of the natural systems themselves. Certainly the natural system increas- ingly becomes a parent system or a sibling system to our socio- technical system domain e think of Hurricane Katrina and the Fukushima Nuclear Power plant in the tsunami (The National DIET of Japan, 2012) e where knowledge of how such natural events occur and escalate will aid our contribution to risk assessment and resilience engineering-based solutions or consequence manage- ment systems. As an example close to my own work, natural events concerned with climate, soil, microbiology, botany needed to be risk assessed in combination with human and organizational fail- ures in our work on grain inspection regimes in Australia (Wilson et al., 2009b). An interesting notion of relevance to the idea of parentechild or siblingesibling systems is ‚Äúsystems of systems‚Äù (e.g. Stasinopoulos et al., 2009). Where technology is concerned it is easier to draw clearer boundaries between systems, and thus the notion of sys- tems of systems is perhaps easier to grasp and explain in the context of purely technical systems than for the socio-technical or humanemachine systems of interest to E/HF. The people element of each system/sub-system crosses the boundaries and by doing so blurs distinctions. For instance, a bed in a hospital is a system, the patient monitoring equipment is a sibling system, the two together plus the patient‚Äôs room comprise another system, perhaps a parent system; whereas the radiology or scanning equipment, the drugs dispensary, the beds, the ambulances are all systems, but together can be seen as a system of systems when looking at maintenance and replacement regimes. However, for each of these when we look at the socio-technical system e including the patient being brought to hospital in the ambulance, monitored in the bed, being scanned,  having drugs administered, and the nurses monitoring the patient, administering the drugs, moving the patient in and out of the bed etc, the human elements cross all the boundaries and so the idea of a system of systems does not perhaps capture the integrated nature of the parent socio-technical system and all the child systems within it.  3.2.  Context  Moray (1994) amongst others proposed that all behaviour and performance takes place in a setting or a context, and E/HF must understand and account for this context, which increasingly is that of complex socio-technical or even social systems. What is useful for analysis of complex systems, parentechild or sibling systems is some form of systematic representation which shows where and how system boundaries operate and how each can provide context for others. Rasmussen‚Äôs (1990 and 1997) well known risk man- agement framework for instance has been used by several authors to explain the layers of complex systems (e.g. Waterson, 2009b). If everything that people do and everything that E/HF studies, improves and implements, takes place in a context, and is part of a system of goals, activities, means and artefacts, then we must deÔ¨Åne what elements within the system of interest are of proper interest to E/HF and to any particular analysis or development. By extension we need to decide what lies outside this remit, even though impacting on the work we do and the systems we critique or design. If we are working at a systems level then in deÔ¨Åning our system we need some version of the old task analysis stopping rule, but working outwards rather than inwards. In other words, where is the boundary of our system of interest, at what point does our system end and another e sibling or child or parent system e begin? Deciding on and being clear about this is the Ô¨Årst step in an analysis for a systems E/HF initiative. There are no real rules for deciding where to deÔ¨Åne the boundaries for the system of interest, other than being clear and sensible enough to acknowledge that the setting of the boundary must be useful for the purposes of the analysis, recognising that the boundary for one form or analysis of the system may be different than for another. An extension of the argument of the primacy of context is to suggest that few if any laboratory studies are properly ergonomics because they cannot account properly for the complexity and multiple factors found in real settings (see de Keyser, 1992; de Montmollin and Bainbridge, 1985). A key problem with laboratory work is that even the most statistically signiÔ¨Åcant of results in the best controlled experiments may only account for a fraction of the real variance in real practice (largely due to the issue of complexity as alluded to below). For example, an experiment might show clear statistically signiÔ¨Åcant differences in recognition and comprehen- sion performance for participants using two alternate colour codes for an alarms management system. However, in practice in an electrical control room, the better performance with one coding may only be responsible for a fraction of variance in humanema- chine systems performance, whereas the layout of the room, the lighting, relationships with colleagues, shifts worked, the quality of supervision, and the degree of control in the operators‚Äô role may actually explain almost all the variation in quality of alarms man- agement. My own view is that systems ergonomics should be car- ried out ‚Äúin the wild‚Äù except for where ethical or substantial pragmatic issues intervene. That is, laboratory research has its place but not a primary one.1  1  I do recognize that for some this may be a little extreme, and must point out to the reader that this may not be a universal view in E/HF.  
8  3.3.  Interactions  J.R. Wilson / Applied Ergonomics 45 (2014) 5e13  3.4. Holism  e  The basic nature of a system is that it consists of interacting parts. Or at least that is how a systems approach typiÔ¨Åes the object of interest. This very fundamental view lies at the heart of many of E/HF approaches and concepts e humanemachine sys- tems, socio-technical systems, joint cognitive systems etc. Our purpose is to optimise (or at least satisÔ¨Åce) the interactions involved with the integration of human, technical, information, social, political, economic and organisational components. Such integration takes place mainly within the development and implementation phases, but continues throughout the system lifecycle into operational use, maintenance, testing and decom- missioning (including sustainability). The argument that the most useful E/HF has a focus on the in- teractions themselves and not on the things interacting (Wilson, 2000) is basic to many approaches within E/HF such as joint cognitive systems for personeartefact interactions, or distributed cognition for people peopleework taskseorganization in- teractions. Since E/HF is about understanding and design for the interactions not the components in the system we analyse and design a ‚Äúpeopleebuilding‚Äù interaction not a building, a ‚Äúpersone deviceeperson‚Äù interactive network rather than an interface or device alone, and a personeteameorganization interaction not a team per se. In our world of E/HF the interactions we are interested in are purposeful. It is particularly interesting to view interactions from an ergonomics perspective in the light of studies, analyses and understanding of co-operation e e.g. McMaster and Baber (2012), and identiÔ¨Åcation of factors of collaboration e e.g. Patel et al. (2012). To take a systems E/HF approach means that we do not treat an equipment or workplace development say as if it were an island, separate from the end users, other stakeholders and the organisa- tion. Parallels may be found in other Ô¨Åelds: manufacturers must account for supply chain interactions and inÔ¨Çuences, on both local and international scales; train operating companies and infra- structure owners must account for the inter-operability of their operations with other modes of transport or railway in other countries; software engineering enterprises must integrate plan- ning for development across the product life-cycle and allow for integration with other software; procurement departments must account for the interface of new pieces of equipment (physically or in software) with existing systems; and manufacturers will examine the design and implementation of a production system with respect to its interaction with maintenance systems in a design for maintainability approach. The notion of interaction is strongly related to that of systems complexity. It is the very complexity of the world and of the social and socio-technical systems within it that is part of the rationale for a formal discipline and profession of E/HF. Wisner (1995) talked of the inapplicability of the linear model as the paradigm for ergo- nomics, in the context of recognizing the effects of complexity. The phenomena of interest in systems in respect of the nature of complexity, and by extension of great interest in human factors, are, according to Rouse (2007, p. 267): human and social behaviours (including human performance, mental models and social net- works); interdependencies across time and space and across do- mains; rapid change and uncertainties; and the location of system boundaries (broadly or narrowly drawn, or even non-existent) (see also Beguin, 2011). It is however the very complexity in many of today‚Äôs social and socio-technical systems, and the related un- certainties, which at one and the same time necessitates a clear E/ HF systems approach to understanding but also creates difÔ¨Åculties for E/HF analysis and understanding. Flach (2012) and Hollnagel (2012) provide interesting discussions of complexity.  Many early systems thinkers pointed out that systems should be seen as a whole, as holistic (e.g. Angyal, 1969). The discipline and profession of E/HF are holistic; that is we see the person ‚Äúin the round‚Äù, seeking to understand the physical, cognitive and social (and increasingly today emotional) characteristics of people in or- der to enhance the interactions they have with artefacts, informa- tion, environments and other people. Such a holistic perspective is the very raison d‚Äô√™tre for E/HF. However, for simplicity of expla- nation to the outside world and to rationalise the broad church of ergonomics, we may sometimes describe various technical branches of E/HF such as physical, cognitive, and organisational/ social ergonomics. At a level below this we may have branches such as forensic, macro, participatory ergonomics etc. But whilst this is understandable for convenience it is potentially dangerous if it leads us to think that the discipline can be so easily partitioned. In a holistic systems view the cognitive, physical and social must be combined to an extent which is appropriate to the project and system, the issues to be studied or improved, and the type of investigation, analysis and solutions involved. The above mainly concerns the holism of E/HF inputs, but out- puts should be addressed holistically also. These are the impacts of people on the performance of the humanemachine, socio-technical and social systems, and the impacts of systems design on the well- being of all stakeholders (i.e. all effected by, or coming into contact with, the system) e physically, mentally, emotionally. Being holistic means that a design change expected to produce safety beneÔ¨Åts should be speciÔ¨Åed so as to enhance, say, system efÔ¨Åciency and reliability as well, and that solutions to enhance physical health could be addressed to increases in mental health also.  3.5.  Emergence  The Ô¨Åfth signiÔ¨Åcant feature of a systems E/HF approach is the recognition of the emergent properties of systems (see Johnson, 2006), including the emergent properties of the human compo- nents. Emergence is central to E/HF in three closely related ways. First, all systems in real use, with real users and under the con- straints such as of time, space, management pressures, motivation that are found in practice, will display characteristics and operate in ways not expected or planned for by their designers. Every ergonomist working with real users in real companies will be familiar with the cry from the engineers e ‚Äúbut we didn‚Äôt expect them to do that!‚Äù The history of failure of grandiose ICT projects is littered with examples of end users who did not (and never had if the developers had troubled to Ô¨Ånd out) behave as the job speci- Ô¨Åcation, operating procedures or developers/managers‚Äô (or worse, ICT consultants‚Äô) idealisations had suggested (e.g. National Audit OfÔ¨Åce, 2011). Dysfunctional emergent properties of the humane machine system can be reduced through better human factors integration throughout the development lifecycle. The second type of emergent properties is intimately related to the Ô¨Årst, whereby the impact of poor designs in fact may be miti- gated through the well recognised ability of users to Ô¨Ånd a way to make the system work despite its shortcomings. As recognized by Bainbridge‚Äôs (1983) ironies of automation many years ago, people Ô¨Ånd ways to accommodate, avoid, overcome or work around sys- tem deÔ¨Åciencies in designs which were predicated on poor intel- ligence about the context, the tasks, the constraints, the users and their needs and contributions. Thus people may behave in non- speciÔ¨Åed and non-predicted (though probably predictable by E/ HF expertise) ways which are in fact beneÔ¨Åcial to system perfor- mance; many ways of working with a system emerge due to the intuition, creativity and ingenuity of people.  
J.R. Wilson / Applied Ergonomics 45 (2014) 5e13  9  Third, and again positively, there is the idea of emergence where people unexpectedly take advantage of capabilities in a product or role not dreamed of by designers, or Ô¨Ånd new system uses. We are all familiar with the child who Ô¨Ånds pleasure in using the box for imaginative games rather than the toy inside it, and the well known example of the possibility of widespread texting being little thought of by early mobile phone developers. This kind of emer- gence can be found in the increased inroads into large company or defence community use of COTS (commercial off the shelf tech- nologies) and, conversely where what starts out as a piece of capital equipment Ô¨Ånds its way onto the consumer market some time later. The E/HF practitioner, whilst not blessed with 20/20 predictive capability, should at least be alert to potential or actual changes e whether dysfunctional or functional e in use of products and sys- tems and the ways of working of people. E/HF analyses and eval- uations should allow for the possibility of emergence from the inter-connected economic, political, legal and other interactions as well as the physical, cognitive and social ones that we may have designed for.  3.6.  Embedding  The sixth feature of a systems approach is the way in which we as ergonomists carry out our work, and who we do this with. This means the way ergonomics Ô¨Åts within the organisational system and is embedded within practice (Wilson, 1994). Of course good ergonomics is participatory and so, as far as possible, we work with all key stakeholders and subject matter experts (Haines et al., 2002). However, all large companies with an E/HF function have to make a choice of where to place them within the organisation. This might be within operations, design, engineering, safety, training and so on. Some companies might try to distribute human factors across all these groups, or across product-based or regional sites, but unless the numbers of E/HF specialists are large this, in my experience, runs the risk of the small (sometimes single person) groups being isolated, being picked off or marginalised, or of them ‚Äúgoing native‚Äù and ceasing to offer an ergonomics view, and seeing things from the perspective of their host department or function.  4. Rail systems ergonomics/human factors  In this section practical examples of systems ergonomics are taken from work on a large number of projects in rail ergonomics/ human factors. This research has included fundamental develop- ment of new ideas, theory, tools and knowledge, and applied research to improve rail work systems (e.g. Wilson et al., 2005, 2007, 2012).  4.1.  Systems focus in rail E/HF  Without wishing to overstate the case there has been a shift in the approach of human factors in domains such as rail over the past few years, with human factors taking a holistic, socio-technical and root cause view on systems. This is partly in response to dealing with systems complexity and partly due to the human roles, functions and activities being often distributed e temporarily, spatially and functionally. Activity in a system may take place continuously or discretely over a period of time and we can ‚Äúfollow‚Äù the artefacts or people of interest through that system over time (an equivalent here is following the ‚Äúpatient journey‚Äù through a health system e e.g. Buckle et al., 2010). Action may also take place over a wide geographical area, for instance the work of a forest Ô¨Åre Ô¨Åghting crew as they carry out their work in a command centre, on the ground in the forest and from the air. Activity may also be functionally distributed, for instance an Olympic Games design and  development team containing planners, concept designers, engi- neers, architects, stylists, production engineers, systems engineers, marketing specialists and customer representatives. Fig. 1 provides a simple model of our contribution wider rail systems engineering work, capturing the holistic nature of E/HF and the contribution to people and humanemachine systems performance, the equipment and interfaces they use and the wider systems and organisations involved. We carry out or support analysis, design and integration activities, in order to understand people‚Äôs knowledge and competence (who they are), their tasks and functions as employees or customers (what they do), the ar- tefacts or equipment to support their work or tasks (how they do it) and the setting, culture and context they perform in (where they do it). The diagram was Ô¨Årst constructed to describe the apparently very different areas of activity undertaken by the Network Rail Ergonomics Team e from occupational psychology to design en- gineering and embracing culture, competence, cognition, equip- ment, environment, functions and tasks e as part of a coherent (systems-oriented) whole. We can see the trend to take a systems viewpoint when studying rail in a large number of instances. For instance very early work to examine how to support rail passengers through improved architectural design or information display carried out classical studies of design of signs and their placement in key positions within stations. More recently such studies have developed and deÔ¨Åned personas, and tracked passenger journeys (e.g. Pattison et al., 2007) from leaving home or at least arrival at the station through all aspects of access, information Ô¨Ånding and train boarding, and then subsequently alighting at the other end, and including interaction with other vehicles in a multi-modal trans- port system. Current concerns are with identifying and under- standing the siting, information density and updating needs for passenger decision points and conÔ¨Årmation points on their journey (Moncrieff, 2012, personal communication). An interesting example of the increased contribution of E/HF to understanding natural systems, and certainly in terms of their potential impact on people, can be found on the railways and in a drive to improve environmental sustainability. In classical E/HF terms, there has been a drive to develop information and other systems to aid fuel efÔ¨Åcient train driving. But moving more into the natural systems territory, an agenda setting exercise to establish human factors relating to environmental sustainability at an organizational level has also led to identiÔ¨Åcation of potential im- pacts on and of people under a variety of scenarios for serious and long-term climate change (Ryan and Wilson, 2012). Rail provides interesting conÔ¨Årmation of the argument advanced above, that it is more difÔ¨Åcult to be clear about system boundaries and systems of systems for socio-technical systems  Fig. 1. Representation of rail systems ergonomics/human factors.  
10  J.R. Wilson / Applied Ergonomics 45 (2014) 5e13  than for purely technical ones. A train traction unit (engine) or maybe a whole train including carriages etc can be deÔ¨Åned as a system but the whole transportation network e the train, the track, the electrical power system, the stations, car parks, the roads used to get to the station etc e as a system of systems. Wider still, the rail industry is a very large and complex system of systems, with at the top level individual interacting systems of the rail infrastructure owner, the rail operating company, the maintainers and contrac- tors, passengers, regulatory authorities etc. The road network can be typiÔ¨Åed in a similar fashion, and wider still road and rail together comprise an enormous complex system of systems with inter- modal carriage of people and freight the goal. When we examine the socio-technical system(s), a passenger sitting on a train, together with the seat, light, table, window etc, can be represented as a humanemachineeenvironment system. But, a whole carriage containing multiples of such HMES is not a system because there is little inter-connection (other than when someone talks loudly into a phone!) and no shared goals. However, when the context changes so does the notion of the system; in an emergency evacuation the whole carriage and the passengers in it become a system, with shared goals and interacting with each other and with the lighting, space (corridors), seats (as obstructions), any instructions in the carriage or over a PA system etc.  4.2.  Context of  the rail network and rail companies  As far as context is concerned, this is critical for the railway. At the top level government policy and strategies, especially in terms of the organisation of the industry (how it is divided up between infrastructure owners and rail operating companies for instance) and the consequent commercial and operating contracts, has a profound effect on meeting human factors requirements. Strongly related to this, the position of the railways in the public‚Äôs affection (in many societies) effects their perception of when things go right or wrong, including their perception of how much safety they can expect (as with other complex systems such as healthcare, they perhaps expect greater levels of safety than can possibly be deliv- ered). At another level we have the regulators, those concerned with health and safety as are found in any safety critical industry, and those concerned with commercial contracts and public value for money. Then, and the astute reader will realise that we are following Rasmussen‚Äôs (1997)stages of risk management in large systems, there are the layers of the organisation, its management, its supervisors, all direct and indirect staff, and the hardware and software systems they work with. Whilst it would be idle to pre- tend that in every piece of work we do on the railway we account explicitly for all these levels, we do so wherever possible. To take a number of examples, for study of the behaviour of control room operators (e.g. Balfe et al., 2012; Farrington-Darby and Wilson, 2009; Dadashi et al., 2012) with a view to the design of better information interfaces e then our focus of interest would be the roles and functions of the operators, the strategies they employ and the decisions they make, the collaborative work undertaken in the control centre and with remote agents, and the information interfaces used to support their work. Therefore we may be inter- ested in the position of electrical power points and desk di- mensions (for layouts to support high quality work behaviour) but certainly not in how the national electricity grid works. If our focus is the design of operating procedures and their inÔ¨Çuence on vio- lations then we could beneÔ¨Åt from knowing something about the workings and priorities of the national regulator but at a practical E/ HF level we are far more interested in organisation culture, in- Ô¨Çuences on errors, short-cuts and work-arounds, and the incidence and consequences of such behaviour in terms of incident reports. If we have as a central issue the choice between large shared screens  and personalised displays we may be interested in team in- teractions but, at the level of performance we are concerned with, not concerned about the font size and contrast on the displays; such issues and design choices would come into play at a later stage. What these three examples have in common is the need to decide early on what level of system we are gathering data at and what level we might be implementing changes for. Other system layers may be interpreted as contextual, and although we need to understand a certain amount about them we would not be working at a deep data collection level. For instance our work on the understanding of planning for engineering work (Wilson et al., 2009a) was strongly related to the impact of the regulator and unions in terms of acceptance of somewhat radical changes for provision of protection on track. Understanding of intra- and inter-organisation levels was vital because of the lead times and multi-agency cooperation required. Our function analysis leading to risk analysis was clear about the interactions between tech- nical supervisory, safety supervisory, planning and track workers levels.  4.3.  The railway is a distributed interactive system  In relation to interactions, in essence the railway is a large, complex distributed system of many technical, organisational, economic and human components. This distributed system is spread across regional, national and cultural boundaries, giving additional problems of inter-operability. Clearly this is a system of inter-connected parts, with multiple links, and very complex in functional, topographic, temporal and communication terms. The links are multiple and constantly changing. E/HF can only be successfully accounted for, and an E/HF function can only add value, if an integrated systems view is taken of activities and processes throughout the development and operational life of rail systems. This involves an integration plan with consideration of all operational modes (normal, abnormal, degraded and emergency), across technical (for example, lineside signals and in-cab information displays) and organisational (train and freight operating companies, projects and regions) systems. An extension of the inter-connectedness and complexity of the systems that we deal with is that all such systems will have multiple, and frequently competing, goals, meaning that the rail- way and the ergonomics support for it must continually make trade-offs. Work on planning and delivery risks in track engi- neering and maintenance identiÔ¨Åed these as being across E/HF goals (or criteria) of safety, reliability, efÔ¨Åciency, use of capacity, security, environmental sustainability and cost (Wilson et al., 2009a). Our research into track maintenance and engineering activities, including access and protections, investigated the roles and contribution of a number of inter-acting functions such as the person in charge of possessions, engineering supervisors, con- trollers of site safety, lookouts, signallers, drivers (of engineering trains and other network users), and machine controllers (Wilson et al., 2009a). From an E/HF perspective all aspects of rail engi- neering and the rail system are interconnected and a number of efforts have been made to typify the system involved, to establish how different parts interact, from planning through to delivery, and including how both safety as well as efÔ¨Åcient performance is propagated through the system. Amongst the means used to do this we have included social network and communications ana- lyses (Moncrieff, 2009), command/control graphics, models and metrics of resilience (Ferreira et al., 2011), visual scenario analysis (Schock et al., 2010), and span of control measures (White et al., 2013).  
J.R. Wilson / Applied Ergonomics 45 (2014) 5e13  11  4.4. Holistic approaches to railway ergonomics  The rail network is an excellent example of a complex socio- technical system e the health service, emergency services, off- shore gas and oil are others e where every kind of work and hu- man factor is present. The stakeholders include signallers and controllers (electrical, infrastructure fault and trafÔ¨Åc); drivers; station and on-train staff; planners, engineers and managers; track (maintenance) engineers and workers, lookouts and site safety controllers; passengers and the general public (the last both legit- imate e e.g. at level crossings, and illegitimate e e.g. trespassers). The rail system includes work in vehicle control, systems process control, monitoring, planning and physical work, occurring in set- tings such as vehicle cabs, control rooms, outdoors in all weathers, and large buildings and spaces. The artefacts used include VDUs, signals, paper, CCTV, hard wired controls, hand tools and large engineering plant and vehicles. Therefore the human factors contribution must be multiple, combining cognitive, physical and social theories, methods and knowledge. Linking the contextual and the holistic in our approach to sys- tems ergonomics, in the research addressing rail engineering we have examined the use of mobile computing (Dadashi et al., 2012). Clearly use of such devices involves examination of physical, cognitive and organisational interactions, and the way these are multiplely connected. The devices need to be usable in all outdoor conditions, robust yet easy to handle; the screens need to be able to present location maps and access routes, maintenance histories, technical advice and to do so in a meaningful and accessible manner given space constraints; and we need to understand the change in organisational relationships and communications links once more information access and thereby control is given in the Ô¨Åeld to ‚Äúremote agents‚Äù. To allow for context we developed a functional use assessment tool, EDARE, to understand what different functional needs, and thereby information access re- quirements, different job groups would have in the practice. This has been extended more recently into similar analyses of infor- mation needs, and development of a framework for relevant hu- man factors, for different functional groups as contemporary intelligent infrastructure systems begin to be implemented (Dadashi et al., 2013).  4.5.  Emergent properties of rail systems  Many of the aspects of emergence e both potentially dysfunc- tional and potentially beneÔ¨Åcial e are found in rail engineering. Two examples only are given here, both with implicit consider- ations of holism also. First of all, the advent of intelligent infra- structure will have a profound effect on how things are done in railway inspection, planned maintenance and reactive mainte- nance, and control of operations, and on who carries out the work. The aim of intelligent infrastructure is to move from Ô¨Ånd and Ô¨Åx to predict and prevent (Dadashi et al., 2012). Key decisions will have to be made about the degree to which the continual monitoring and diagnosis of the state and performance of assets is handled by people or automated systems, and how these will be integrated. A choice will also have to be made about the extent to which Ô¨Årst and second level alerting and decision making will take place on-site (with potential beneÔ¨Åts of immediacy, having local knowledge and decisions and actions being appropriate to location and cir- cumstances), or else off-site in remote control centres (with po- tential beneÔ¨Åts for cost, consistency and co-location of key expertise). Major E/HF contribution to intelligent infrastructure will also come through developing the means to reduce what will be millions even billions of bits of data from sensors down to manageable knowledge and intelligence to be used by people with  different roles and agendas. We will need the development of appropriate data screening/Ô¨Åltering routines, and conversion into intelligence via human-centred and ecologically valid displays, appropriate to, for instance, control centre operators, mobile staff on track, and business analysts. Given the needs to create effective working systems out of ‚Äúclever technology‚Äù of intelligent infra- structure, new human factors will certainly emerge over the next decade, which may be expected or unexpected, and which will profoundly alter the ways in which the rail socio-technical system delivers its objectives. Our system-based early work has at least prepared us for the likely challenges ahead. The second example of emergence is shown when we study how people‚Äôs jobs will change as their information sources and decision supports become more mobile and personal (Dadashi et al., 2012, 2013), and e with increased use of sensors e as information be- comes ambient. Although intended at Ô¨Årst as a convenient non- paper way of supervisors on track recording or down-loading required information, the advances in mobile computing will inevitably mean that people will work in different ways, commu- nicating with different people, and making decisions differently given the increased knowledge and interrogation facilities available to them. Therefore we will see the emergence of new roles, communication channels, relationships, power structures, sources of decision making and liaison/collaborations. Taking a systems- oriented view enables us to see that the socio-technical system will change far beyond the early expectations of the engineers and operational specialists. A major question to be addressed by a rail organisation is of the degree to which they want to restrict the span of control and decision latitude of their remote agents on-track or whether they want them to be able to use all the new information and processes available to them in order to behave as a true high- skill and high-knowledge operative.  4.6.  Embedding ergonomics/human factors in the rail  industry  As regards embedding, in our own case of the Ergonomics Team within Network Rail, we were for over 10 years based within the engineering function, and more recently within a wider asset management function. Given what was said earlier about systems ergonomics and systems engineering, engineering is seen by this author as the best home for an E/HF team. Certainly the impact of the Ergonomics Team on new systems and projects, and on main- tenance, renewal and enhancement activities has been facilitated greatly through close relationships with engineering, although the strategic relationships we have set up with operations as well have also proven very valuable, and the Team has at times worked closely with other functions such as safety and sustainability, corporate affairs and maintenance. The point is that wherever the E/HF function is situated it must collaborate with all other functions in order to do its job. It is often because a good systems-oriented E/ HF practitioner actually does work with all other functions, indeed has to do this in order to do their job properly, and must understand all stakeholder needs (including those of people managing or building the system as well as of end users), that they are invaluable for successful systems engineering.  5.  Conclusions  The widespread acceptance of need for and value of the systems orientation of ergonomics/humans factors is increasing. It is seen as one of the ways in which we can distinguish ourselves from other professions and deÔ¨Åne ourselves and our approach to potential clients (Dul et al., 2012). The debate over systems E/HF has in fact become more urgent as we seek to maintain and strengthen E/HF as a discipline and a profession. It is possible that we can recognise its  
12  J.R. Wilson / Applied Ergonomics 45 (2014) 5e13  absence better than we can deÔ¨Åne it, and so this paper has been an attempt to rectify that by explicitly deÔ¨Åning six features of systems E/HF, and illustrating these with examples from work in rail human factors. This is particularly important since this author believes that all education and training for E/HF practitioners and researchers should build from a systems engineering and systems E/HF basis. There are some dangers of course in taking a systems perspec- tive. In fact there might seem to be some irony in investigating and enhancing at a systems level, since the very descriptor ‚Äúsystem‚Äù can imply dealing with a number of constituent parts rather than being holistic. A study or implementation that starts out as manageable can become unwieldy and even impossible if layer upon layer of connected systems are brought into the remit; a clear danger is of micro-analysis where this is not needed. Even at a single sub- system level we have all seen analyses in which everything seems to connect with everything else, and the analysts appear to be unable to prioritise any groups of entities or links. Equally if an analysis is at too superÔ¨Åcial and high a level then nothing of any value may emerge. The spectrum from not seeing the trees for the wood to not seeing the wood for the trees is a wide one and E/HF systems practitioners have to make clear choices about levels of analysis and extent of concerns early on. Of course it is rare that any one ergonomics study, initiative or even programme can embrace every aspect of the system and hence all human factors. Resource availability and indeed logic dictate against this. In the author‚Äôs own work there have been times when the enormity of trying to analyse and address all aspects of a system became too much and we concentrated on particular sys- tem parts instead (e.g. Wilson and Whittington, 2001). But even then, the rest of the wider system was acknowledged as context. Nearly two decades ago Nigel Corlett said in an unpublished paper to the IEA Executive that ‚Äú[a systems view] does not mean dumping the linear concept, many of our problems can be solved via a linear paradigm and for many situations it is a powerful approach. But it is not enough .and we must take on board some of the more recent [systems] thinking if we are to keep up with need.‚Äù Even in projects which have been set up to have a narrow focus, perhaps because of sponsor and client constraints, there is a need to know what the wider system is, what the context and what the key interactions, and how all this can be accounted for in the interpretation and use of Ô¨Åndings. A beneÔ¨Åcial outcome of taking a systems-level perspective is that the right questions will be asked early on in the analysis programme, even if not everything can be addressed in development subsequently. At the start of this paper a deÔ¨Ånition of systems was given, but not explicitly one of systems E/HF. Subsequently six deÔ¨Åning fea- tures of systems E/HF have been discussed and illustrated in the body of the paper. Bringing together these different strands in the paper leaves us with a suggested deÔ¨Ånition of systems E/HF as:  Understanding the interactions between people and all other elements within a system, and design in light of this under- standing, a system being a set of inter-related or coupled ac- tivities or entities (hardware, software, buildings, spaces, communities and people) with a joint purpose; E/HF seeks to understand the links between the entities may be of state, form, function and causation; E/HF conceptualises any system of in- terest as existing within a boundary and thus a deÔ¨Åned context, having inputs and outputs which may connect in many to many mappings; E/HF treats the system as holistic with the whole usually greater (more useful, powerful, functional etc) than the sum of its parts; and E/HF explicitly recognizes that the system changes and modiÔ¨Åes its state and the inter-actions within it in the light of circumstances and events, thus showing emergent properties.

s0003687013000677,"  Law enforcement ofÔ¨Åcers have traditionally worn and carried various protective and functional equipment required in the discharge of their duties (Hooper, 1999; Stubbs et al., 2008). For the New Zealand Police, the duty belt and mandated appointments (equipment currently consisting of a duty belt, radio, extendable baton, pepper spray, handcuffs, a personal protection kit and a torch) weigh approximately 3.5 kg (Stab Resistant Body Armour  and Guidelines, 2007). Body armour (e.g. stab resis- tant body armour, SRBA) is used widely by law enforcement and other agencies internationally. In 2007, SRBA was introduced to all frontline New Zealand Police, purportedly in response to escalating crimes of violence, and to reduce ofÔ¨Åcer fatalities (Stab Resistant Body Armour  and Guidelines, 2007; Wallwork,  * Corresponding author. E-mail addresses: paddy.dempsey@otago.ac.nz (P.C. Dempsey), phil.handcock@ otago.ac.nz (P.J. Handcock), nancy.rehrer@otago.ac.nz (N.J. Rehrer).  2010). While the SRBA (2.7e3.8 kg depending on size) provides protection from stabbing, blunt trauma, and small calibre bullets, it has been suggested that the SRBA and belt unit negatively affect police physical performance (Hooper, 1999; Stubbs et al., 2008). Although there is a wealth of literature exploring the impact of added load (backpacks) on human performance (Knapik et al., 1996), few studies have been designed to assess the effect of body armour on task elements typically encountered in policing. Most research involves analysis of military based tasks using heavier specialised military body armour, Ô¨Ånding that it adversely affects mobility, strength, speed, balance and physiological strain (Dorman and Havenith, 2009; Larsen et al., 2011; Ricciardi et al., 2008). The weight and rigidity of SRBA along the length of the torso may also hinder an individual‚Äôs ability to move efÔ¨Åciently and correct loss of balance (Hooper, 1999; Stubbs et al., 2008). Anec- dotal police reports and ofÔ¨Åcer interviews within New Zealand and the United Kingdom suggest that SRBA and appointments restrict job related mobility during a number of work related tasks. Tasks cited were running, pursuing, rapidly exiting vehicles and scufÔ¨Çing or grappling with an offender.

The purpose of this study was to explore and provide informa- tion on the inÔ¨Çuence that the wearing of SRBA and mandated ap- pointments has on physiological markers of effort and performance during the completion of simulated mobility tasks. We hypoth- esised that wearing the SRBA and appointments would negatively impact all mobility tasks and increase the physiological effort of movement. Given that failure to complete critical tasks in police work could have potentially fatal consequences for police ofÔ¨Åcers, their work colleagues, and the public they serve, this research is timely and necessary.  2.

s0003687013000689,"  The inanimate bicycle symbol has long been used to indicate the animate activity of bicycling facility signs. In contrast, either the inanimate bicycle symbol or the animate bicycle symbol has been used interchangeably for the standard pavement symbols in bike lanes. This has led to confusion among pedestrians and cyclists alike. The purpose of this study was to examine two different designs (inanimate symbol vs. animate symbol) involved in the evaluation of perceived preference and glance legibility, and investigate sign design features on bicycle pictorial symbols. Thirty-Ô¨Åve participants compared current bicycle signs (inanimate symbols) to alternative designs (animate symbols) in a controlled laboratory setting. The results indicated that the alternative designs (animate symbols) showed better performance in both preference and glance legibility tests. Conceptual compatibility, familiarity, and perceptual affordances were found to be important factors as well. √ì 2013 Elsevier Ltd and The Ergonomics Society. All rights reserved.  Bicycling is one of the most popular recreational activities and is also an important method of transportation for local commuting. Compared to the use of motor vehicles, bicycling has many ad- vantages such as low cost and signiÔ¨Åcant health beneÔ¨Åts. Impor- tantly, bicycling also produces zero pollutants and helps reduce trafÔ¨Åc congestion. However, increasing numbers of bikes on the road have heightened the need to make bicycling safer and more accessible. The national government‚Äôs Federal Highway Adminis- tration (FHWA) has promoted various programs to increase bicy- cling safety and accessibility, including shared-use paths, pedestrian and bicycle information centers, and via the establish- ment of the National Center for Safe Routes to School. In particular, the ‚Äúshared-use paths program‚Äù is expected to increase bicycling opportunities through the more than 11,000 miles of paths super- imposed on railroad corridors that continue to expand across the nation (Pedestrian and Bicycle Information Center, 2010). In 2009, 630 bicyclists were killed and an additional 51,000 were injured in motor vehicle trafÔ¨Åc crashes (NHTSA, 2009). Although these numbers have decreased from a 2005 high of 786 fatalities, and given the underreporting of bicycle accidents and injuries  * Corresponding author.

Since bicycle- related signage plays an important role in providing trafÔ¨Åc infor- mation, the current standards should be assessed and validated for their efÔ¨Åcacy. Up to now, roadway signs have featured the inani- mate bicycle symbol (the ‚Äúriderless‚Äù bicycle) for portraying the animated and vigorous activity of bicycling. In the case of standard pavement symbols in bike lanes, both the inanimate bicycle symbol and the animate bicycle symbol (bicycle with a rider) have been used interchangeably. This variability has led to a lack of cohesion and consistency in bicycle-related signs, which could result in a failure to communicate the desired information. TrafÔ¨Åc signs are one of the most important components of a transportation system in that they help guide, regulate and warn road usersddrivers, bikers, and pedestriansdof possible hazards. Pictorial symbols have been widely used in trafÔ¨Åc signs since they can effectively convey complex information using limited re- sources, for example, shape, size, and color. Moreover, as research has conÔ¨Årmed, pictorial symbols are more easily identiÔ¨Åable than words from a greater distance (Collins and Lerner, 1982), and support better performance of memory tasks compared to text (Paivio, 1986). Pictorial symbols also provide safety and risk infor- mation that is more inclusive, providing cyclists with graphical cues rather than verbal cues (Smith-Jackson et al., 2010). Similarly, well- designed pictorial symbols convey hazard information rapidly and with less mental workload on recipients (Smith-Jackson, 2006). However, pictorial symbols are not always designed to be easily understood and recognized (Collins et al., 1982; Wolff and  0003-6870/$ e see front matter √ì 2013 Elsevier Ltd and The Ergonomics Society.

K. Oh et al.  / Applied Ergonomics 44 (2013) 990e995  991  Wogalter, 1993). In fact, pictorial symbols that are poorly designed can actually convey misleading information, resulting in frustration or even more serious consequences such as threats to safety and health (Laughery and Wogalter, 2006; Rogers et al., 2000). A number of studies of these symbols have investigated issues of comprehension and legibility, particularly with respect to the ef- fects of various factors, e.g., driver characteristics, sign design fea- tures, cultural differences, and the ergonomic principles of the design (Ben-Bassat and Shinar, 2006; Ng and Chan, 2008; Shinar et al., 2003; Young and Wogalter, 1990). With regard to current problems in bicycle-related signs, the most critical aspect is that the pictorial symbols in use today do not always correspond to the intended message of the sign. In other words, a bicycle symbol depicting a bicycle without a rider could be interpreted in several ways depending on the symbol used and the location. While it could indeed convey the intended messagedthat a driver should expect to share the road with bicyclistsdit could also be interpreted as a location for a bicycle parking place, or a bicycle store or repair shop. Several studies have explored the importance of context in pictorial symbol design. Bazire and Tijus (2009) proposed a framework for understanding road signs, and showed that natural categories (categories used by drivers) are not consistent with legal categories (categories deÔ¨Åned in legal texts about driving), thus pointing to the confusion that can result from context-related issues. Wolff and Wogalter (1998) also emphasized the effect of context in the evaluation of pictorial symbol compre- hension, with the primary variable being either the absence or presence of photographs depicting the probable environments where a symbol would be seen. Their study conÔ¨Årmed that context is important for providing important cues that result in increased comprehension. Therefore, given the rising popularity of bicycling, it is imperative to assess current bicycle pictorial symbols to ensure the efÔ¨Åcacy of these signs. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of sign design features that comprise bicycle pictorial symbols for bicycling facility signs. Current bicycle signs were compared to alternative designs regarding perceived preference in a controlled laboratory setting. Glance legibility was also examined. These Ô¨Åndings are expected to provide useful information and recom- mendations to design more effective bicycle signs.  2. Method  2.1. Design  Laboratory experimentation was used to determine the effects of sign designs on participants‚Äô preferences, using a within-subjects design. Quantitative values were obtained using preference rank- ings, and, following the preference test, open-ended questions were administered to gauge the participants‚Äô opinions of most/least preferred signs. In the glance legibility test, the effects of symbol (10), size (5), and color (2: positive and negative contrast) on the percentage of correct answers in each condition were examined using a within-subjects design.  2.2.  Participants  Thirty-Ô¨Åve participants were recruited for this study. Of these, 21 were male and 14 were female. The mean age of the participants was 19.7 years (SD ¬º 1.41; Min ¬º 18, Max ¬º 23). Participants were recruited through the experiment management system of the Psychology Department at Virginia Tech. All participants received one research credit for participation. The participants were limited to individuals who (1) were greater than 18 years of age, (2) had minimum visual acuity of 20/  20 or better in both eyes with or without correction, and (3) had normal color vision (self-report of no color blindness or cataracts). Prior to beginning the experiment, participants‚Äô visual acuity was tested by using the Snellen Eye Chart. All participants were licensed automobile drivers. Sixteen participants (46%) self-identiÔ¨Åed as frequent drivers (daily), and 19 participants (54%) as occasional drivers (two times a week or less).  2.3. Materials  The current bicycle-related signs were Ô¨Årst seen in a 1979 manual produced by the FHWA, known as the ‚ÄúManual on Uniform TrafÔ¨Åc Control Devices.‚Äù The symbol, seen in Fig. 1(a), is a stand- alone bicycle image with signiÔ¨Åcant details (e.g., handlebars, implied frame-lines within the wheels, and seat). For comparison purposes, this study reviewed existing bicycle-related signs and selected national recreation signs developed by the Society for Environmental Graphic Design (SEGD) as the alternative bicycle signs since signs‚Äô design features were compatible with the purpose of this study. The three images, shown in Fig. 1(b), feature a simpler bicycle design, but include a helmeted rider. A 17-in. LCD monitor with 1280  1024 resolution was used to present the stimuli (signs) for both preference and glance legibility tests. The images of the signs were developed as precisely-sized vector Ô¨Åles using Adobe Illustrator software. The images were shown to the participants using Adobe Acrobat 9 Pro to maintain Ô¨Ådelity while controlling size, timing and intermediate images between stimuli projections. In the preference test, participants were asked to compare the current bicycle sign with three alternative designs by identifying the most preferred sign. Three major bicycle-related sign applica- tions were tested: bicycling, bicycle warning, and no bicycling. Two motorcyclist signs were included to serve as distracters. In terms of four other bicycle-related applications (i.e., pedestrian and bicycler crossing, hill, and bicycle surface conditions), an alternative design was designed and tested with the current bicycle signs. Participants were asked to give preference rankings for each question based on perceived preference. In addition, the participants‚Äô reasoning was solicited via open-ended questions regarding most/least preferred symbols. In the preference test, participants were required to sit in front of the LCD monitor. The distance between the LCD monitor and a participant‚Äôs position was approximately 2 ft (60 cm) with image frames containing symbols that were 1.500 (38 mm) across and above the visual threshold. In the glance legibility test, 10 symbols, 5 sizes, and 2 colors were examined. Among the 10 symbols utilized, two were current bicycle signs and 3 alternative designs. The remaining 5 symbols were not bicycle symbols but were included as distracters in order to prevent participants from memorizing the bicycle symbols.  2.4.  Procedure  Upon entering the lab, participants completed an informed consent document and demographic questionnaire, which included visual acuity, color vision deÔ¨Åciency, and driving experi- ence. Prior to beginning the study, participants‚Äô visual acuity was  Fig. 1. Current bicycle signs (a) and alternative bicycle signs (b).

Those who met the mini- mum visual acuity standard (20/20) were allowed to continue on to the experiment. Participants participated in both the preference test and the glance legibility test. The preference test was always performed Ô¨Årst. Participants were not timed; they were given sufÔ¨Åcient time to determine their preferences and describe their reasoning. In the glance legibility test, participants were required to sit in a Ô¨Åxed position. The distance between the LCD monitor and the participant‚Äôs position was 20 ft (600 cm), which was designed to replicate 20/20 visual acuity with mid-sized symbols in the 5 sizes. To remove potential distractions, all non-related objects in the experimental space were covered with white sheets. Each symbol was displayed for one second on the LCD monitor, and between displays, an abstract roadway image was displayed in order to remove any iconic memory within the eye. After projection of each display, participants were asked to identify the same symbols using reference card. The order of the 10 symbols was randomized pro- gressively by size, beginning with the smallest series of 10 symbols, and transitioning to the next series of larger symbol size. Half of the participants examined the positive contrast format Ô¨Årst (white on green), while the other half tested the negative contrast format Ô¨Årst (black on yellow). The average time required to complete the experiment was approximately 60 min.  3. Results  3.1.  Preference  The mean rankings for all conditions are shown in Table 1. A lower mean ranking indicates higher preference. In all conditions, one of the three alternative designs (the bicycle symbol with a rider, handlebars, and implied bicycle frame within the wheels) was preferred to the current ‚Äúriderless‚Äù bicycle sign. A ShapiroeWilk test of normality was conducted to determine the distribution of the dependent variables. All distributions were  non-normal. Consequently, non-parametric tests were conducted for subsequent analyses. A Friedman test (two-way non-parametric ANOVA) was used to determine whether there were signiÔ¨Åcant differences between rankings of symbols in each question. Results indicated that there were signiÔ¨Åcant differences among the rank- ings of the six signs in three applications, p < 0.0001. Additional post-hoc paired comparisons using Z tests showed that there were signiÔ¨Åcant differences between the current bicycle sign and the alternative sign only in the bicycling warning application (Fig. 2). Apart from that single application, no signiÔ¨Åcant differences be- tween the current bicycle sign and alternative designs in bicycling and no-bicycling applications were observed. Participants‚Äô opinions on most preferred signs from the open- ended question were qualitatively analyzed using thematic anal- ysis to identify the common reasons of participants‚Äô preference. The qualitative results in Table 2 represent participants‚Äô responses and redundant responses were emitted. Participants‚Äô responses, such as ‚Äòmost representative of a person riding a bike‚Äô were based on the actual words reported by participants to describe the reason of their preference. In addition, the percentage and number of par- ticipants choosing each sign were noted. For example, in the bicy- cling application, 13 participants preferred the current bicycle sign, whereas 19 participants preferred one of alternative bicycle designs (the one featuring a handlebar and implied bike frame) and 3 participants preferred the other alternative bicycle designs among total 35 participants. With respect to sign applications for pedestrian and bicycler crossings, hills, and bicycle surface conditions, participants also preferred the alternative design. The qualitative results from participant responses are shown in Table 3.  3.2. Glance legibility  The percent of correctly-chosen symbols in each condition was calculated to use as the legibility fraction (Table 4). A mixed model ANOVA with symbol, series, and color was used to test differences in the model, as well as group differences accounting for variance in legibility. Two effects were found to be statistically signiÔ¨Åcant: symbol, F(9, 306) ¬º 44.74, p ¬º 0.0001 and series, F(4, 136) ¬º 49.15, p ¬º 0.0001. With regard to color (positive or negative contrast), there was no signiÔ¨Åcant effect. To determine which of ten symbols were signiÔ¨Åcantly different, post-hoc paired comparisons were conducted using a least squares difference test. The results revealed differences in alternative designs and the current bicycle symbol. In terms of the series, responses were signiÔ¨Åcantly different from each other, which describes decreased legibility along with decreased symbol size. In particular, the results showed that the current bi- cycle symbol has greater detrimental effect on legibility than the alternative designs. For example, the current bicycle symbol (sign 1) showed 14% (green: series 1) and 57% (green: series 2) of correctly answered results, while the alternative design (sign 2) had 71% (green: series 1) and 80% (green: series 2) of correctly answered results on Table 4.

Discussion  In general, the results of this study indicate that the alternative design (the bicycle symbol with a rider, handlebars, and implied frame within the wheels) performed better in both the preference test and the glance legibility test. Several interesting trends were also identiÔ¨Åed. In the preference test, the alternative bicycle design (the bicycle symbol with a rider, handlebars, and implied bicycle frame within the wheels) was the most preferred (Fig. 3), with the current bicycle sign (the riderless bicycle symbol) the next most preferred in all  three applications (bicycling, bicycling warning, no bicycling). Although the difference between the alternative symbol and the current symbol was statistically signiÔ¨Åcant only with the bicycling warning application among three applications (bicycling, bicycling warning, no bicycling), the fact that the alternative symbol was the most preferred across all applications has important implications. The qualitative results from the open-ended questions also vali- dated that the alternative design (the bicycle symbol with a rider, handlebars, and implied bicycle frame within the wheels) helped participants clearly understand the fundamental meaning of bicy- cle signs.  Table 3 Response results from the pedestrian and bicycler crossing, hill and bicycle surface condition applications.  Application  Pictorials  Pedestrian and bicycler crossing  % (Number) of participants  72% (25)  Representative responses  Simple, clear, has enough space between the bicycle and pedestrian to easily distinguish between the two; presence of the dotted line gives drivers clear notice of pedestrian crossing  28% (10)  Descriptive, easy to identify, better description of what is going on, clear illustration  Pedestrian and bicycler crossing  100%(35)  Both pedestrian and bicycle are separately illustrated, easier to infer the two pictures.

There are several possible explanations for this Ô¨Ånding. First, the pictorial symbol of a rider on a bicycle allowed participants to grasp the essential meaning about the action of bicycling, which is the fundamental communicative intent of bicycle-related signs. In comparing participant responses about the current bicycle sign vs. the alternative design, participants who chose the alternative design suggested that it resembled a bike rider; those who chose the current sign said it depicted a bike more realistically. Therefore, the bicycle sign with a rider is suggested to have better conceptual compatibility with the intended information to be conveyed.  Conceptual compatibility refers to the extent to which codes and symbols are meaningful to those who must use them (Ben-Bassat and Shinar, 2006; Shinar et al., 2003). Second, the fact that the current bicycle sign was the second most preferred symbol may have something to do with familiarity. To reiterate, there were no signiÔ¨Åcant differences in mean rankings between the current bicycle sign and the alternative design (the most preferred one) except in the bicycling warning application among the three applications (bicycling, bicycling warning, no bicycling). Since the current bicycle signs have been in use since  Table 4 The percentage of correctly answered in each condition.

s0003687013000707,"  Despite the availability of humanoid robotic platforms, their social acceptance is still a challenging open issue. First studies like the so-called ‚Äúuncanny valley‚Äù proposed in (Mori, 1970) (see Fig. 1) or the one proposed in (Kaplan, 2004), agree in classifying the social integration of robots in human environments as a non-trivial task. In industrial environments, where humanoid robots might be adopted to complement human labor, the problem of integrating humans and robots in the same workspace might turn to be even more challenging. Human-robot cooperation should not just be physically safe, (De Santis et al., 2008), but also psychologically comfortable to the humans. Beside the human-like appearance of robots, which is discussed e.g. in (Hwang et al., 2013), a better and natural cooperation could be achieved if humans are, at all times, assured that they understand what the robot‚Äôs intentions are, and that the robot executes its tasks with motion proÔ¨Åles that humans perceive as safe, (Kulic and Croft, 2007a). This requirement must comply with the production constraints, which require an accurate task execution. The availability of many degrees of freedom (DOF) might facil- itate the achievement of all these requirements. Humanoid robots  * Corresponding author. zanchettin@elet.polimi.it (A.M. elet.polimi.it (L. Bascetta), rocco@elet.polimi.it (P.

In fact, since the same task can be performed in several ways without any task performance degradation, redundant manipulators offer a wide range of Ô¨Çexibility in motion planning. Besides optimizing some performance criteria (energy consumption, manipulability, dis- tance from joint limits, etc.) redundancy can be exploited to syn- thesize (i.e. reproduce with an articulated manipulator) the motion of human arms. The motion of the human arm has already been investigated in several prior works, ranging from pure kinematic approaches to more complicated neuromuscular analyses, often with focus on redundancy resolution. A brief review of related studies will be given in the Section 2. From an ergonomics standpoint, in view of the layout of new production lines populated by both robotic manipulators and hu- man operators, it is important to assess in an objective way the impact of different redundancy resolution techniques to the psy- chological state of nearby humans. Assessment of the quality of the HRI by measuring the affective state of humans is an interesting and emerging topic. A survey of physiological methodology to assess the quality of the HRI is given in Section 2. This paper contributes to these issues by discussing a method- ology which has been used to analyze the affective state of humans working side-by-side with human-like robotic manipula- tors, as a function of the strategy used for redundancy resolution.  0003-6870/$ e see front matter √ì 2013 Elsevier Ltd and The Ergonomics Society.

A .M. Zanchettin et al.  / Applied Ergonomics 44 (2013) 982e989  983  and biomechanics, are very active in the Ô¨Åeld, as well. In this context, the pioneer work (Hogan, 1984) presented the Ô¨Årst results in modeling natural trajectories for the human arm as resulting from a jerk minimization criterion. Further research led to more detailed objective functions. Recently, in (Khatib et al., 2009), a biomechanics-based inves- tigation has been performed, where the muscular redundancy has been explicitly taken into account. It was argued that in a static conÔ¨Åguration, among all the possible muscular activations, the optimal posture can be predicted using a weighted least-square approach. Finally, from ergonomic studies on the arm posture, in (McAtamney and Corlett, 1993) an index called RULA to measure the discomfort of a particular arm posture has been proposed. The same index has been recently exploited to obtain a shorter and more natural-looking motion for the dual-arm anthropomorphic robot JUSTIN developed at the DLR (German Aerospace Center), see (Zacharias et al., 2011). In previous works from the same authors of the present paper, see (Zanchettin et al., 2011), a model describing the natural way humans adopt to resolve arm redundancy has been identiÔ¨Åed. Based on motion capture experiments, we performed a nonlinear correlation analysis between the hand pose (position and orienta- tion) m and the elbow swivel angle a, see (Kreutz-Delgado et al., 1990), resulting in the following model  a ¬º p√∞m√û  ¬º 0:88cos√∞q √æ 2:30√û   0:40cos√∞r √æ q√û √æ 0:49cos√∞q √æ f √æ 2:98√û   1:39   0:21atan2√∞z; y√û   0:64sin√∞r√û   0:50atan2√∞y; x√û   0:22cos√∞r √æ q √æ f√û √æ 0:47cos√∞f √æ 0:60√û   0:15atan2√∞z; x√û √æ 0:34cos√∞r √æ f √æ 1:07√û  (1)  which relates the right elbow swivel angle with the Cartesian co- ordinates of the right hand x; y; z and the Euler angles respectively. While the analysis of the human motion was inten- tionally performed for future used in a robotic controller, as dis- cussed in (Zanchettin et al., 2012), the quality of the HRI arising from these particular motion primitives had not yet been addressed.  r; q; f,  2.2. Affective state assessment  In this Section, a short survey1 of existing methodologies to measure the affective state, with particular emphasis on quality of the HRI, is presented. Although a well-established methodology to analyze emotions is not yet available, a commonly adopted framework to represent the emotional state of individuals has been presented in (Lang et al., 1993). The author proposes a characterization of affective experi- ences in terms of two main categories: valence and arousal. Valence represents the pleasantness of stimuli, with positive (or pleasant) at one end and negative (or unpleasant) at the other end. The other dimension is called arousal (activation level) which corresponds to the state of being awake or reactive to stimuli. The different emotional labels can be plotted at various positions on a 2D plane spanned by these two axes to construct a 2D emotion model, see e.g. (Lang, 1995), as sketched in Fig. 2. Statistical correlations of different physiological signals ranging from the heart or respiration rates to the skin conductance or the  1  The reader is referred to (Mauss and Robinson, 2009) survey.  for a more exhaustive  Fig. 1. The so-called ‚Äúuncanny valley‚Äù (source Wikipedia), an intuitive correlation between robots‚Äô human-likeness and their social acceptance; this correlation is posi- tive until a certain thresholds, called the uncanny valley where such correlation be- comes negative.  Experiments have been performed on 18 volunteers whose physi- ological response to different motions of the robot has been measured using a dedicated instrumentation and a well-deÔ¨Åned protocol. Data have been analyzed using statistical tools. As a result, it is shown that there is a clear correlation of the emotional state of the volunteers with the adopted redundancy resolution criterion. We believe that the methodology described in this paper and the related outcome represent a signiÔ¨Åcant contribution in the Ô¨Åeld of assessment of humanerobot interaction, and may open the way to more articulated methodologies to study ergonomic issues of the envisaged future production lines, populated by both humans and robots. The remainder of this work is organized as follows. In Section 2 some background material on human motion analysis and syn- thesis, as well as on state of the art methodologies to assess the affective state of human volunteers is presented. Section 3 de- scribes the experiments performed to gather all the physiological data needed for subsequent analyses as well as the methodology adopted to post-process the acquired data. Section 4 describes factual results from the statistical analysis, while Section 5 Ô¨Ånally discusses their interpretation.  2. Background  This Section presents a brief overview of state of the art meth- odologies to analyze and synthesize human-like motion proÔ¨Åles. Current methodologies to measure the affective state of humans are also described.  2.1. Human motion analysis and synthesis  Pioneers of neurophysiological studies proposed the existence of neural strategies to explain human motion control, (Bernstein, 1967). These concepts, well-known nowadays and referred to as synergies, were later reÔ¨Åned and exploited in different works to explain natural grasping postures (Santello et al., 1998), reaching movements (Sabatini, 2002), whole body postures as in (Terres- Oviedo and Ting, 2007), etc. Apart from the neuroscience literature, the research commu- nities of information technology, automatic control, optimization,  
984  A.M. Zanchettin et al.  / Applied Ergonomics 44 (2013) 982e989  brain electrical activity with an individual‚Äôs arousal/valence state have been intensively studied, see e.g. (Lang, 1995; Jacobs et al., 1994; Bradley and Lang, 2000b; Kim and Ande, 2008). To some extent, the ‚Äúuncanny valley‚Äù sketched in Fig. 1 was the Ô¨Årst attempt to throw a bridge between robotics and psychology. Pioneers of this Ô¨Åeld were Kulic and Croft, whose studies laid the basis to the robotics community on the measurement of the af- fective state of individuals working side-by-side with robots using physiological devices, see (Kulic and Croft, 2007a). This concept has been further addressed e.g. in (Bartneck et al., 2008) or (Dehais et al., 2011). In studies aimed at measuring the robot-induced stress on humans during coexistence, see e.g. (Kulic and Croft, 2007b), three physiological signals are usually acquired: HR (heart rate), EMG (electromyography), and SC (skin conductance). The typical use of such physiological signals in the Ô¨Åeld of affective state assessment is brieÔ¨Çy reviewed in the following, see also (Bethel et al., 2007).  2.2.1. Heart rate  The absolute value of the heart rate is strongly inÔ¨Çuenced by several factors such as, for instance, physical Ô¨Åtness and posture. Its variability (HRV) is widely used in the medical literature and can be addressed either in time- or frequency-domain. The time-domain analysis typically reveals the arousal state related to hear rate ac- celerations or decelerations, see (Bradley and Lang, 2000b). The frequency-domain analysis of the HRV is typically based on spectral decomposition, see (Malik, 1996; Cohen et al., 1999). Compared with the time-domain analysis, the frequency-domain analysis of the HRV can reveal a more detailed information about the ongoing neural activities. In fact, the heart rate is modulated in response to a variety of stimuli by both the parasympathetic and the sympathetic nervous systems. While the former is responsible for a physiolog- ical response to normal situations, the latter is more related to re- actions to external stimuli producing anxiety, stress and warnings. Several scientists agree on the well-deÔ¨Åned frequency separation between the sympathetic- and the parasympathetic-related activ- ities on the HRV power spectral density (PSD), see e.g. (McCraty et al., 1995; Delaney and Brodie, 2000). In particular, LF (Low Fre- quency) bandwidth of the HRV PSD, approximately in the range 0:04   0:15 Hz, are related to the sympathetic activities, while the HF (High Frequency) bandwidth, between 0.15 and 0.5 Hz, are dominated by the parasympathetic nervous system. As for the correlation of the HRV with the affective states, scientists somehow  agree in relating physiological stress and negative valence with an increased LF to HF ratio, see (McCraty et al., 1995; Delaney and Brodie, 2000).  2.2.2.  Surface electromyography  Surface facial electromyography is a non-invasive technique to assess the affective state of individuals subject to external stimuli of different nature, ranging from visual, (Lang et al., 1993), to acoustic, (Bradley and Lang, 2000a), ones. More recently, it has been also adopted to analyze the emotional state while playing at computer games, as in (Ravaja et al., 2008), or to address the quality of the humanerobot interaction (Kulic and Croft, 2007a). The analysis of the EMG signal is deÔ¨Ånitely less involved than the one adopted for the ECG signal, however a variety of different methods exist, ranging from the integrated EMG signal, as explained in (Jorge and Hull, 1986), to spectral analysis, see e.g. (Lindstrom et al., 1970). As for the correlation with the affective state, it is agreed that facial EMG activities are related to unpleasant emotions, (Bradley and Lang, 2000b; Codispoti et al., 2001; Larsen et al., 2003).  2.2.3.  Electrodermal activity  used  for  affective  (SC)  state  is widely  Skin conductance estimation. The SC signal includes two types of electro-dermal activity: the DC level component and the skin conductance response (SCR). The DC level in the SC signal, or skin conductance level (SCL), indicates the general activity of the perspiratory glands inÔ¨Çuenced by body temperature or external temperature, (Kim and Ande, 2008), while Ô¨Çuctuations around the average level are due to sweat secretion initiated by distinct bursts of sudomotor nerve activity, which result from the liberation of acetylcholine by the sympathetic nervous system, (Boucsein, 1992). In turn, SCR is usually adopted as an indicator of the activation level in response to stimuli (Bach et al., 2010b; Khalfa et al., 2002). Usually, the SC exhibit a signiÔ¨Å- cant drift and several researchers prefer to account for its variability by high-pass Ô¨Åltering the acquired signal, (Kulic and Croft, 2007a). Temporal characteristics of the SCR signal (latency, rise time, amplitude, recovery time, etc.) and their analysis, see e.g. (Bach et al., 2010a), are usually adopted to analyse discrete or short events, (Boucsein, 1992; Khalfa et al., 2002; Dawson et al., 2007). In turn, tonic levels of electrodermal activity over long-duration (e.g. > 1 minute) and persistent stimuli, see e.g. (Krumhansl, 1997).  3. Materials and methods  We here conjecture that making robots not only kinematically similar, but also able to move and act in the same way as humans do, might facilitate their social acceptance. The experiments described in the following were aimed at capturing the physio- logical comfort/discomfort of humans working side-by-side with the robot. No physical interaction or cooperation with the robot was expected. In the following a detailed description of the experiments (participants, equipment, protocol and data processing) is given.  3.1.  Participants  age 26:7  4:6 have been Eighteen healthy male subjects of selected within master students and the research personnel at Politecnico di Milano. They have been recruited without any remuneration using the Department mailing list. All participants were right-handed.

A .M. Zanchettin et al.  / Applied Ergonomics 44 (2013) 982e989  985  3.2.  Experimental setup  A workspace resembling a working environment has been assembled. The dual-arm prototype robot ABB FRIDA, see e.g. (Kock et al., 2011), has been placed in the middle of the table and a working station has been setup on the left, next to the robot. The overall setup is shown in Fig. 3. In order to test the physiological response to different robot trajectories, three redundancy resolu- tion criteria have been designed and implemented within the ro- botic controller, using the native programming language. The Ô¨Årst one corresponds to the human-like (HL) kinematic control strategy, derived from (1) and extended to the left arm by exploiting the symmetry of the human body (and of the robot prototype). The second one (non human-like, nHL) has been selected in order to enforce a different correlation between the hand pose and the In other words, two functions p√∞,√û, one for the right elbow angle. arm, the other for the left arm, different from the identiÔ¨Åed ones in (1), have been selected. The last one corresponds to a non human- like time varying (nHLTV) redundancy resolution criterion which has been designed by assigning (without any speciÔ¨Åc criterion) a time-dependent value to the elbow angle. Figs. 4 and 5 report snapshots from the three motions and the time histories of the left elbow swivel angle, respectively. As one can see from Fig. 5, the nHLTV motion is characterized by a more jerky proÔ¨Åle, whilst the nHL is in turn characterized by higher elbow elevations. The three different trajectories were covered in exactly the same time interval, since the only difference is the redundancy resolution criterion. Moreover, during the three motions, the robot performed exactly the same task, i.e. with the same end-effector movements at the same speed. The task was designed to resemble typical as- sembly operations, with typical human-like velocities. The only difference between the three executions was only in the so called the task, i.e. in the portion of the joint space which does not entail motion of the end-effector. The PROCOMP INFINITI system from THOUGHT TECHNOLOGY was used to acquire the physiological data. The heart muscle activity was measured via ECG (ElectroCardioGraphy) measurement using EKG Flex/Pro sensor. The SCR (Skin Conductance Response) was measured using the SCFlex-Pro sensor. The activity of the corru- gator muscle was measured with the MyoScan Pro surface EMG (ElectroMioGraphy) sensor. The sampling frequency was 2048 Hz for the ECG signal and 256 Hz for both the SCR and EMG signals. The EMG electrodes were arranged in the abdominal placement and Ô¨Åxed with steucoplastic tape to limit the effects of artifacts. The  null-space of  Fig. 3. Setup for the physiological experiments.  EMG tripolar electrode has been placed on the frontalis muscle, with the reference electrode on the sagittal plane and the two measurement electrodes to measure the activity on the muscle Ô¨Å- bers closest to the robot, just above the eyebrow. The SCR probes have been placed on the Ô¨Årst phalanges of the digitus secundus (pointer Ô¨Ånger) and of the digitus annularis (ring Ô¨Ånger), respec- tively, of the hand closest to the robot.  3.3.  Procedure  Before the experiments, volunteers were asked to sign a form where they agreed to allow the researchers to collect physiological data. Each volunteer was assigned a coded identity label, which was used to mark these data. Their actual personal details, except from the age, were not recorded. The researchers then explained the purpose of the experiments reading the following text:  This experiment is part of the EU FP7 project ROSETTA. We orga- nized this experimental campaign to address the problem of physio- logical stress during humanerobot coexistence. The experiments are aimed at investigating the reactions of subjects to robot trajectories. During the experiments no physical interaction with the robot is ex- pected. Please stand relaxed and possibly avoid strong voluntary movements. Physiological data (ECG, EMG and SCR) will be acquired with medical instruments.  The researchers prepared the volunteer attaching ECG, EMG and SCR probes and checked their correct behaviour by asking the volunteer to contract three times the corrugator muscle. The re- searchers then checked the correct alignment of the volunteer to the table and asked him to place his hands on the table and to get a comfortable and relaxed position. Approximately 180 s of physiological data have been acquired before triggering the robot motion, of which the last 10 s will be regarded as baseline for subsequent analyses. Then, the assembly- like task and the corresponding redundancy resolution were acti- vated. The robot performed three cycles (one for each type of redundancy resolution). During each cycle the assembly task was repeated twice with the same redundancy resolution scheme. The total duration of the motion was approximately 120 s, while the total duration of one session (including instructions, sensors arrangement, and setup) was about 10 min. Notice that each subject experienced the three redundancy resolution methods in different sequence in order to remove the possible effects of prior experiences of the robot motion, which may inÔ¨Çuence and bias the measurements, as pointed out in (Bartneck et al., 2008). A short interview was Ô¨Ånally taken to collect subjective im- pressions from the volunteer, concerning the perceived safety, naturalness of the robot motion and an estimate of the emotional state (boredom, anxiety, etc.).  3.4. Measurements and post-processing  This Section describes the procedure adopted to extract relevant features from the raw acquired signals. Particular attention was paid to minimize the effect of artifacts, which might invalidate subsequent analyses.  3.4.1.  Processing of  the ECG signal  From raw ECG data, a Ô¨Ålter was applied in order to recognize QRS complex and estimate the time instant corresponding to the R peak. Therefore, the output signal is simply a train of pulses, cor- responding to the depolarization of the left ventricular, which is responsible of the R peak in the ECG waveform. Then, the time interval between the subsequent R peaks (called RR interval) was

The resulting discrete time signal, updated at the end of each RR interval, is usually called tachogram. Spline interpolation has been Ô¨Ånally applied to increase the time resolution of the tachogram. The HRV was then computed using a frequency domain analysis, by means of the estimation of its PSD.  Fig. 5. Left elbow swivel angle during the three motions (HL: solid black, nHL: dashed black, nHLTV: solid gray).  Since the portion of each experiment related to a particular redundancy resolution scheme is very short in time, the tachogram was Ô¨Årst re-sampled at 4 Hz, and the overall linear trend, corre- sponding to the VLF (Very-Low Frequency) bandwidth < 0:04 Hz, was removed. Then, following modern approaches in the analysis of the HRV signal, see e.g. (Carvalho et al., 2003), an AR (Auto Regressive) model of order 15 was identiÔ¨Åed using the well-known YuleeWalker equations. The PSD of HRV signal has been therefore estimated directly from the AR model coefÔ¨Åcients, (Akaike, 1969), rather than applying the FFT (Fast Fourier Transform) to the HRV signal. This way a smoother PSD with a higher frequency resolution was obtained. Fig. 6 shows the frequency domain analysis of the HRV related to one of the experiments.  3.4.2.  Processing of  the EMG signal  While most of the existing methods to analyse EMG signals are related to muscular force estimation, this work is rather focused on stress assessment. For this reason, an accurate estimation of the intensity and of the total duration of each contraction is not considered here. The analysis of the muscle activity developed in this work is based on the detection of the so called onsets and offsets, (Hodges and Bui, 1996). An onset is deÔ¨Åned as the time interval during which the muscle is contracted, whereas an offset corresponds to a negligible muscle activity. In order to estimate whether the cor- rugator muscle was contracted (onset) or not (offset) a windowing approach was introduced. It was Ô¨Årst noticed that the level of noise  
measured during the baseline acquisition was signiÔ¨Åcantly lower with respect to the one measured during the actual experiment. Therefore, in order to remove the noise, the median of the entire acquisition was Ô¨Årst measured and then removed from the acquired signal. Then, the IQR (Inter Quartile Range) was computed and used as an estimate of the noise amplitude. Finally, a candidate onset was recognized when EMG activity was greater or equal to 2.0 IQR for at least Dt ¬º 40 ms. The onset recognition was then conÔ¨Årmed if the maximum level of the EMG signal was greater or equal to 3.0 IQR. The resulting onsets/offsets signal is shown in Fig. 7.  3.4.3.  Processing of  the SCR signal  The measured skin conductance has been Ô¨Årst re-sampled at 16 Hz and then Ô¨Åltered with a Butterworth high-pass Ô¨Åler of order 6 with a cut-off frequency2 of 0.04 Hz. This way, the DC level of the SC signal, which turned out to contain a signiÔ¨Åcant drift, has been removed.  3.4.4. Derived statistics from post-processed data  In the following, the Ô¨Ånal analysis of the post-processed experimental data is reported. In particular, the deÔ¨Ånition of sta- tistics aimed at quantifying the robot-induced stress is explained. For the ECG signal, a common way to assess the dominance of the sympathetic nervous system with respect to the para- sympathetic one, is to measure the ratio between the power associated to the two corresponding bands of frequency, (McCraty et al., 1995). Therefore, the following statistics was computed  ECG ¬º LFi;RR si;RR HFi;RR  (2)  where  LFi;RR ¬º  Z0:15Hz  0:04Hz  PSDi;RR √∞f √ûdf  HFi;RR ¬º  ZN  0:15Hz  PSDi;RR √∞f √ûdf  (3)  while i ¬º 1; .; 18 and RRÀõfHL; nHL; nHLTVg.  As for the EMG activity of the corrugator muscle, the number of contractions per minute, regardless their duration and intensity, was counted:  si;RR EMG ¬º  60  tf   t0  Ztf  t0  edge    onsetsi;RR √∞t √û    dt  (4)  where edge√∞,√û is a function returning a unit Dirac pulse corre- sponding to rising edges of the input. For the analysis of the skin conductance, the following statistics has been considered:  si;RR SCR ¬º  1  tf   t0  Ztf  t0    SCR i;RR HighPass √∞t √û  2  dt  (5)  which, apart from some scaling factors, corresponds, from Parsev- al‚Äôs theorem, to the integrated PSD of the SCR over the frequency ¬Ω0:04 Hz; N√û. Notice range that the statistics introduced in (5) captures all the phasic SC features, i.e. the number of SCR (onsets), their intensity and duration, regardless the SCL and slowly-varying Ô¨Çuctuations which typically characterize tonic electro-dermal activity. We Ô¨Ånally introduce a robot-related average elbow elevation statistics:  statistics  deÔ¨Åning  the  sRR elbow ¬º  1  tf   t0  Ztf  t0  zi;RR  elbow √∞t √ûdt  (6)  where zRR elbow represents the instantaneous elevation of the elbow during the experiment.  4.  Facts and results  For each statistics (EMG, ECG, and SCR) the KruskaleWallis ranking test was Ô¨Årst performed to exclude possible correlation between the three groups (HL, nHL, and nHLTV). Figs. 8 and 9 report the boxplots of the normalized ECG and EMG statistics, respec- tively. At Ô¨Årst glance, the ECG and the EMG statistics agree in pre- dicting a clear trend. In order to obtain a more rigorous veriÔ¨Åcation of this conjecture, the Page‚Äôs L-test and the Jonckheere‚Äôs trend test were computed for both the ECG and the EMG statistics.  0  20  40  60  80  100  120  140  160  0.8  0.85  0.9  0.95  1  1.05  1.1  0  0.1  0.2  0  4  8  0  0.1  0.2  0  2.5  5  0  0.1  0.2  0  0.5  1  Fig. 6.

For the SCR analysis, we here make use of a different ordering of the three robot trajectories by using the average elbow elevation statistics selbow , which results in the following order elbow . Using this alternative order of the three motions, the resulting boxplot of Fig. 10 lends itself to a meaningful trend analysis. In fact, a positive trend of this statistics with respect to the average elbow elevation can be now reported. The Page‚Äôs L- test and the Jonckheere‚Äôs trend test were computed. The results of the two trend tests, as well as of the KruskaleWallis correlation analysis, are reported in Table 1.  5. Discussion  All the acquired physiological signals agree in highlighting perceived differences between the three groups of motions (Krus- kaleWallis test: EMG p < 0:01, ECG p ¬º 0:097 and SCR p < 10 5 ). This was somehow conÔ¨Årmed during the short interviews where  Fig. 9. Boxplot of the normalized EMG statistics.  the majority of the volunteers admitted to have noticed slight dif- ferences in the robot motion throughout the measurements. As for the trend analysis, EMG and ECG signals produce the same increasing trend with respect to ordered groups (HL, nHL, nHLTV) with high signiÔ¨Åcance (Page-L test: EMG pz0:05 and ECG pz0:01, Jonckheere‚Äôs test: EMG p < 0:01 and ECG p ¬º 0:014) meaning that there is an increased physiological activity during both the nHL and the nHLTV motions with respect to the HL motion, with higher values corresponding to the nHLTV scheme. The positive trend is more pronounced for the ECG signal with respect to the EMG signal, as also conÔ¨Årmed by the two p-values. Evidence that the HL motion is responsible of less pronounced physiological activity can be re- ported. Moreover, the jerkyness of the nHLTV trajectory seems to be responsible for an increased value of the LF/HF ratio, as well as a slightly observable intensiÔ¨Åcation of facial muscular activity. Concerning the SCR signal and the alternative order (HL, nHLTV, nHL), the increasing trend can be observed with statistical signiÔ¨Å- Jonckheere‚Äôs test: p < 10 4 ).

An increased level of awareness can be reported for increasing value of elbow elevation, with maximum values corresponding to the nHL motion, characterized by the highest level of elbow elevation selbow . This fact was also reported during the interview by some of the volunteers, who declared to be sur- prised/uncomfortable due to the vicinity of the elbow to their face.  6.  Conclusions  For the same assembly-like task performed by a dual-arm robot, the effects of three redundancy resolutions on a human fellow co- worker were compared by means of physiological signals. The human-like redundancy resolution strategy, characterized by lower elbow elevations, induced a quantiÔ¨Åed reduction of the emotional arousal and was responsible for reduced EMG activity and LF to HF ratio on ECG signal. For these reasons, human-like motion proÔ¨Åles are the candidate to effectively reduce the robot-induced stress in human fellow co-workers, resulting in a more ergonomic interac- tion. Further and deeper investigations are still needed to address the effect of long-lasting exposition to robot motions.

s0003687013000732,"  For industries in complex and often safety critical environments the human factors contribution to safety is increasingly at the socio-technical systems and safety management level. It is perhaps easy to assume that all or most physical ergonomics concerns are by now fully understood in such systems and industries. Their physical health and safety potential problems may not have been entirely designed or managed out but we possibly assume that at least all the research needed to address problems of manual handling (in all its senses) has been completed. This paper concerns just such a particular physical health and safety problem which emerged whilst a rail infrastructure company was largely concerned with human error and organisational failure at a systems and safety management level.

The physical health and safety problem covered in this paper exists due to the continuing use, for good operational reasons, of legacy signalling technology alongside much newer and more sophisticated operating systems. In the UK and other countries, rail network control is moving into larger, computer-based and centralised control centres and using advanced train control and trafÔ¨Åc management systems. However, for now the signal boxes in the UK are a mix of NX (entryeexit) control panels and VDU-based systems, but also with many me- chanical lever operations. Levers are used in more than 500 of Network Rail‚Äôs signal boxes and centres, with between 8 and 200 levers in each. Levers are used for two main operations e setting signals and changing points. The Ô¨Årst author (BM), an operations expert with ergonomics training, had been called to a mechanical signal box as part of a rolling programme of assessment of mental workload, irregular working and human error.

Over the next three years, in large part because of the investigations reported here, increasing numbers of reports of difÔ¨Åculty, discomfort and injury, claimed as the consequences of working with levers, were identiÔ¨Åed across the UK network. DifÔ¨Åculty in operating rail signal box levers is not a new phenomenon as seen from a report of early last century (and see Fig. 1):  ‚ÄúMrs Kathleen Willingham, 36 years old and married with children, worked from 9 a.m. until 10.30 p.m., a 91-hour week, at a level crossing near Colchester. She had to pull a very heavy lever 144 times a day. The LNER provided a stand-in for only seven hours a week ‚Äòshopping leave‚Äô. Her application for a pay rise to compensate for taking over her husband‚Äôs duties was declined. She asked to get her hours reduced but the LNER treated her as a part-time employee because she could ‚Äòrun home between trains‚Äô. They argued further that she knew the duties of the job when she accepted employment.

The paper Ô¨Årst of all explains the background to rail signal box lever operations, reports any related literature and attempts to interpret some relevant guidance from this. Then the methods of the study are described, consisting of Ô¨Åeld observation, direct measurement, interviews and self-rating, analysis of injury and lost work time statistics, and some limited computer biomechanical modelling work. Details are then given of the management pro- gramme which Network Rail will initiate as a result. The main objective of the research and of this paper is to detail and support the development of the feasible risk management programme rather than focus on the more narrow issues of lever weights and consequent forces in the human body. It is emphasised that the risks referred to are ones of personal safety through the actions of pushing and pulling levers. Although the railway has many areas of systems safety concern, this is not one of them since the secondary safety back-up will prevent safety problems from train routing even in the event of sudden signaller injury.

Background  This paper reports research initiated by the Network Rail Ergo- nomics Team to understand the level of physical injury risk from operating in lever frame signal boxes. This was a study to decide on whether there is a problem, the extent of it, and to set a management strategy to go forward in mitigating any risks in future. Initial obser- vations generated research questions, the most important of these being: What is the safest method of pulling levers? What are safe limits to the weight to be operated? And what methods could be used to limit and manage any risks? The lever frame technology is particular to the railway, has been in place for a long time, and is therefore not compliant to modern standards. Moreover, there was nothing in the established literature to help in answering the ques- tions. A project was set up to include observation and analysis of methods of lever operation, measurement of the weights being moved, and recording of environmental and other inÔ¨Çuences on the methods of operation. Data collected were to support recommenda- tions for a programme of maintenance and modiÔ¨Åcations to those levers and frames where risk is assessed as the greatest, and of training in improved pulling techniques. It is recognised however that without a substantial longitudinal study it might be difÔ¨Åcult to categorically attribute any signaller‚Äôs injury to their work, as activities  2.1.  Types and operation of signal box levers  Although rail signal box levers and frames all work on the same basic principles, there are a large number of different frame and lever designs. This has come about due to them being often designed and built local to the area where they were installed, many over 100 years ago. The levers are used within the mechanical form of signalling which was developed during the 19th century to control the movement of trains. Although dated, lever frame sig- nalling is likely to be with us for a good while longer yet. Me- chanical signal boxes (e.g. Fig. 2) have their connection to external devices e such as signals and points e by wire and channel rodding attached to the levers within a metal frame. There are many vari- ants of frame and lever types, along with different release types (triggers and stirrups). The connectivity between lever and the object to be moved gives some clue as to the differences in lever pull weights.  Fig. 1. Operation of a very early rail  lever.  Fig. 2. Typical mechanical rail signal box.  
B. Muf fett et al.  / Applied Ergonomics 45 (2014) 221e233  223  For signals, the standard design is a wire connection from the tail end of the lever through a system of pulleys and detectors to a counter balanced weight Ô¨Åtted to the bottom of the signal post (Fig. 3a). Signal operation through the wire pull has inbuilt slack and elasticity in order to facilitate temperature changes. This therefore allows the signaller to ‚Äòtake up‚Äô the slack in the Ô¨Årst part of the lever pull and so giving the opportunity to use the mo- mentum and their body weight to move the object. For points the design and operation are connected up through a solid rodding system (Fig. 3b). Point operation is through connec- tivity of solid rodding bars (to maintain gauge allowance for point ends) and so there is no ‚Äòslack‚Äô in the system when pulling the lever. This means that the full weight is experienced by the signaller from the start and throughout the entire pull. Whilst the weight to be pulled (and pushed) is the major factor examined in this study there are other potential hazards in the operation of the levers. Being a mechanical system the connections are prone to sudden failure, often unexpected despite inspection routines, and which could result in acute injury. Also, the long runs of the rods or chains through varying terrain means that they are prone to blockage through bank slides and the operator would have no way of knowing this until trying to take up the weight.  2.2.  Previous relevant research  The industry assessment of operability of levers with respect to their manageability is currently by reference to the length of the connection, with no consideration given to weight of pull. This does not appear to follow recognised health and safety thinking and guidelines and regulations (such as those for manual handling), but the lever systems have been around since long before current guidance was developed. The rail industry does work to a number of Railway Group (mandatory) Standards, and Network Rail itself has standards and guidance which may go beyond the legal re- quirements. Relevant guidance states that: ‚ÄúThe maximum rec- ommended distance at which signals can be mechanically operated is 1000 yards which minimises the effects of temperature change on wire routes‚Äù, and elsewhere that ‚Äúwire operation of mechanical signals should be limited to 1000 m‚Äù. Thus there is some discrep- ancy in the various documents which make it difÔ¨Åcult to determine which distance is most appropriate to use as a reference. Originally signal boxes tended to be close to points in an attempt to lighten the weight of the pull, but this is not always achieved. Current codes of practice state that ‚Äú200 yards satisfy the Health and Safety Executive‚Äù and ‚Äúmanually worked points should not exceed 320 m rodding run from lever to furthest point end‚Äù. The requirements are in the company‚Äôs own code of practice, to which signalling engi- neers generally work, but may be challenging and restrictive to achieve from an engineering point of view. The question that arises is; what is a safe lever weight or effort that an operator can exert given the nature of the task? There is literature on lever pulling but not for full length levers; Page et al. (1990) and Attebrant et al. (1997) examined loads working with hand levers. The former was at railway point switches, but due to the much smaller size of levers this US work concentrated upon hand forces not on whole body movement, and there are no lever frames nor other levers in close proximity to inhibit access; their measured actions also start with the lever parallel to the ground with a lifting movement from a static position and no connectivity through wires or rodding. In a more general description, Kroemer et al. (2001) suggest that large levers used occasionally should have an operational force requirement of less than 190 N. They also Ô¨Ånd that improved pulling force is achieved with one foot off the ground. Resnick and ChafÔ¨Ån (1995) found peak push forces of 500 N for men and 200 N for woman in pushing of carts of between 45  Fig. 3. Connections from levers to (a) signals with a wire running through a system of pulleys and a counter balance weight at the signal; and (b) points, with solid rodding running from the tail end of the lever through a system of cranks.  and 450 kg, and found consistent results for static compression forces at L5/S1 above the NIOSH action limit of 3400 N with stronger participants and loads of above 225 kg. Nothing more speciÔ¨Åc was found in the literature and so the general ergonomics guidance on pulling/pushing was examined. Much of the manual handling literature is concerned with lifting and related manual handling tasks. The maximum pulling and pushing forces of the hand during standing work have long been studied, for example by Rohmert (1966) and Rohmert and Jenik (1971) (both quoted in Kroemer and Grandjean, 2000). Pulling forces are greatest in the vertical plane and lowest in the horizontal plane. Pulling and pushing forces are of the same magnitude whether the arms are held out sideways or forwards (in the sagittal plane). Maximum pulling force depends on height and distance of the pulled element, and body weight and posture are of critical importance especially the stance for pulling (Ayoub and McDaniel, 1974). The same authors generate design guidelines around limits on pull height and distance e a maximum pulling force for men of between 40 lb and 150 lb, and for women of between 50 lb and 90 lb, depending on height and distance. They also Ô¨Ånd that improved pulling force is achieved with one foot off the ground. Review papers covering a wide range of contributions to do with pull/push forces include Gallagher and Heberger (2012) and Hoozemans et al. (1998), but these do not cover material to do with pulling or pushing large levers These papers identify risk factors of weight, distance, foot stance, one-handed or two-handed opera- tion, force at the hand, symmetry of pull/push and static or dynamic

They do say that the risks from pulling are harder to predict than those from pushing, interesting given our greater concern with pulling (see below). The amount of force a user can exert on a control depends on posture, position, and the length of time the force is applied. ‚ÄòJerk‚Äô forces used to loosen tight controls may be two or three times larger than the corresponding maximum steady forces; forces which must be applied over a long period should, it has been suggested, not exceed 15% of the corre- sponding maximum force over 5 s, although some continuous application may last for much longer without rest (Galer, 1989). In a variety of other studies risk factors have been identiÔ¨Åed e none for full length levers and mostly for cart or other moveable object pulling/pushing or else from biomechanical modelling work (for example Boyer et al., 2013; Lin et al., 2012; Seo et al., 2010). The restricted space found in some signal boxes is likely to have some effects e for instance Lee (2007) showed that restricting their space in front of the task reduced pushing strength by about 25%. Cart pushing and pulling is perhaps one of the tasks closest to lever operation in terms of the techniques used. Lee et al. (1991) showed that pulling forces (98, 196 and 294 N) resulted in the greatest loading, with Ô¨Åndings depending on body weight, and that a pulling height of 1520 cm was better for force application than 660 or 1090 cm. In other work, peak pushing forces of 200 N for women and 500 N for men were reached when pushing carts of between 45 kg and 450 kg with consistent compression forces about 3400 N for the strongest participants at weights of over 225 kg. The government guidelines and regulations of a number of countries were reviewed (eg the Health and Safety Executive in the UK, the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (in the USA) and the Work Safe Commission in Australia. A range of limits and guidelines are available, according to the task and other work factors, for instance in the UK the guideline for starting or stopping a load is 20 kg for men and 15 kg for women (Health and Safety Executive, 2004, clause 23). However, there are considerable dif- ferences between lever pulling and the lifting and lowering tasks on which guidelines appear to be based and which are used as examples in the documentation. Furthermore, the manual handling literature is mainly concerned with maximum voluntary weights and forces, and the regulations and guidelines generally are rele- vant to the lifting of free weights. With levers, the operator is pulling or pushing something which is supported by a super- structure and is only free to move in a single plane and in a Ô¨Åxed arc of motion. Finally, the types of additional risk factors concerned with the load e eg being bulky or unwieldy, difÔ¨Åcult to grasp, not stable or rigid (HSE, 2004, clauses 131e144) e do not really apply to levers. Therefore it was considered that any acceptable weight limits for lever pushing and pulling are likely to be different to the existing manual handling guidelines, and are likely to be higher, requiring original work to understand where to place guidance limits for a pragmatic management programme. Looking beyond the weight of a load, the content of the litera- ture that was certainly relevant to our levers study and to a sub- sequent management plan, was identiÔ¨Åcation of risk factors such as space to move, the quality of the work environment, presence of any obstructions, sudden changes in weight (due to friction, snag- ging or jamming in the case of levers, or just overcoming inertia at the start of a pull), and stability and slipperiness of footing.  3.

s0003687013000744,"  Physical activities involving trunk Ô¨Çexion are common among occupational and daily living tasks, particularly lifting, forward reaching and squatting. Epidemiologic studies have reported that tasks involving lifting with repetitive trunk bending and heavy loads pose risk factors for low back pain (LBP) (Hoogendoorn et al., 2000; Widanargo et al., 2011). Recent research has found LBP in adolescents to be more frequent than previously suspected (Burton et al., 2006). In Thailand, the prevalence of LBP among adolescent workers attributed to bending and reaching tasks was approxi- mately 77% (Keawduangdee et al., 2012). These Ô¨Åndings are in accordance with high LBP prevalence rates for workers in the USA  * Corresponding author.

Trunk bending requires multi-joint coordination for lumbo- pelvic and hip movements as well as trunk muscle activation (Lee and Wong, 2002; Wong and Lee, 2004). However, if there is re- striction of one of the multiple joints in the lumbo-pelvic and hip regions, this can result in altered movement and biomechanics of the remaining unrestricted joints (Yoo and Yoo, 2012). Tight pants, speciÔ¨Åcally sizes smaller than Ô¨Åt to a wearer‚Äôs anthropometry, may restrict hip movement and alter trunk muscle activity during work tasks and leisure (Anders et al., 2005). Such clothing has become a popular clothing choice for Thai adolescents. Previous research observed reduced hip mobility in association with increased spinal Ô¨Çexion and extension. This mobility limita- tion and spinal motion may be factors contributing to development of LBP (e.g., Dolan and Adams, 1993; Lee and Wong, 2002; Wong and Lee, 2004). In addition, based on the Ô¨Çexionerelaxation phe- nomenon (FRP), compensatory responses to hip mobility  0003-6870/$ e see front matter √ì 2013 Elsevier Ltd and The Ergonomics Society.

With respect to the FRP, McGill and Kippers (1994) reported apparent electromyographic silencing of lower back muscles during a standing to full trunk Ô¨Çexion maneuver. On this basis, it is hy- pothesized that lower back muscles decrease their supporting role (activation level) during full trunk Ô¨Çexion resulting from reÔ¨Çexo- genic stimulation of stretch receptors in passive structures, spe- ciÔ¨Åcally the posterior spinal ligaments (Solomonow et al., 1999; 2003a,b). Beyond this, with reference to the lengthetension rela- tionship theory, Aratow et al. (1993) reported that elongation of a muscle (with a focus on the lower back) can decrease the number of actin and myosin cross-bridges and subsequently decrease active force output. Therefore, EMG measured muscle activity decreases with elongation. Changes in spine and hip mobility, and trunk muscle activations can lead to stresses at the lumbar motion segment, including altered loads and forces on spinal joints and the posterior spinal ligaments (Dolan and Adams, 1993; McGill and Kippers, 1994). Restricted and altered movement patterns of the hip and lumbar spine, respectively, may lead to low-back discomfort, which can ultimately be a cause of low-back pain and disability (Anders et al., 2005). Historical workplace safety guidelines and regulations have addressed workers wearing loose clothing while operating ma- chines and the potential for garments to become entangled in moving machinery parts (OSHA, 1992). Conversely, little, if any research, has focused on the impact of wearing excessively tight clothing at work, such as tight pants, on occupational illnesses for workers, such as LBP. The objective of this research was to investigate the effect of wearing tight pants (smaller than Ô¨Åt sizes) on hip and lumbar spine movement, trunk muscle activity and perceived low-back discomfort in young adults. The study examined wearing tight garments as a cause of hip movement restriction in simulations of realistic work tasks in a lab environment. SpeciÔ¨Åcally, we compared young adult lumbar range of motion, associated trunk muscle ac- tivity and low back discomfort (LBD) during box lifting, manual material handling (MMH) while squatting, and forward reaching while sitting on a chair. All tasks were performed by participants when wearing tight vs. Ô¨Åt (i.e., the correct size according to anthropometry) pants. The study was expected to complement prior research in the safety area by focusing on risks associated with wearing restrictive garments in work tasks vs. loose Ô¨Åtting clothing hazards. We previously reported on a preliminary study (Eungpinichpong et al., 2012) of a similar nature involving a smaller sample size and no assessment of trunk muscle activity. The results of that study revealed an effect of restrictive garments on hip mobility and increased spinal Ô¨Çexion/extension. Preliminary discomfort ratings also revealed increases for the tight pants con- dition over Ô¨Åt pants. The research motivated the present investi- gation with a larger sample and assessment of muscle activity in conjunction with spinal motion and perceived discomfort.  2. "
s0003687013000756,"  Facing TrafÔ¨Åc, or Bidirectional TrafÔ¨Åc, indicates the roads that allow two or more pedestrians to face each another while walking in opposite directions. The opposite of Facing TrafÔ¨Åc is One-way TrafÔ¨Åc. Facing TrafÔ¨Åc encompasses two types of rules, Right-hand TrafÔ¨Åc (RHT) and Left-hand TrafÔ¨Åc (LHT), which depends on the trafÔ¨Åc regulations of the sovereign country. According to Lucas (2012) and McGregor (2011), 66% of the world‚Äôs population has adopted Right-hand TrafÔ¨Åc, while 34% observes Left-hand TrafÔ¨Åc. Of all the existing roads around the world, 72% of them have adopted the Right-hand TrafÔ¨Åc rules, while 28% employ the Left- hand TrafÔ¨Åc rules. It was not until 2010 that the Ministry of Land, Transport and Maritime Affairs of Korea (MLTMAK, 2011) amended walking reg- ulations from Left- to Right-side TrafÔ¨Åc rules in order to increase pedestrian safety and convenience and to be inline with global walking customs. Before the amendment, Article 13 Section 3 of the Korean Road TrafÔ¨Åc Act stated that ‚ÄúYou must operate your vehicles and horses on the right side of the center of the road (on the right  * Corresponding author.

After careful consideration of information acquired through survey responses and research results conducted by experts from various Ô¨Åelds, including the Ô¨Åndings from the current study, the MLTMAK decided to amend the walking regulations on 1 July 2010. As 34% of the world‚Äôs population resides in countries that still stipulate Left-side TrafÔ¨Åc rules (Lucas, 2012; McGregor, 2011), the current study on walking directions prospects to serve as a land- mark for other countries to take into account. Reports have shown different transport directions of pedes- trians and transportation modes regulated by different countries. Table 1 indicates that pedestrians in Korea and Germany abide by the Left-hand TrafÔ¨Åc rules while the rest of the countries have adopted the Right-hand TrafÔ¨Åc rule. Additionally, it is shown that transport directions of pedestrians and automobiles remain different in some of the listed countries. Although countries including the United States, China, Sweden and Taiwan stipulate for a uniÔ¨Åed transport direction, countries such as Korea, Great Britain, Germany, Japan and Singapore appear to encompass inconsistent transport directions.

Regarding revolving doors, the countries that require driving on the right side generally have doors revolving counterclockwise (access on the right side) and vice versa, although this has not been shown to be universally applied (Beadmore, 2000; Lucas, 2012). According to Article 9 Section 1 of The United Nations Convention on Road TrafÔ¨Åc (Geneva, 19 September 1949), ‚ÄúAll vehicular trafÔ¨Åc proceeding in the same direction on any road shall keep to the same side of the road, which shall be uniform in each country for all roads‚Äù, stressing the necessity for consistency in moving direction. In some countries such as the United States and Canada, where each state or province has its own legislature, different states may have different road rules, but in general they tend to not differ much. For example, no signiÔ¨Åcant discrepancies across the states have been shown in the U.S. since trafÔ¨Åc-related state rules and laws conform to the Uniform Vehicle Code (UVC) stipulated by the National Committee on Uniform TrafÔ¨Åc Laws and Ordinances. However, certain areas in Canada, France, Island, Italy, Portugal, Great Britain, Spain and the United States have also shown excep- tional cases where such laws were not properly regulated (Kincaid, 1986; Lucas, 2012). Cases in Korea have shown to be even more complicated. While the national railroads built during the Japanese colonial period stipulate Left-hand TrafÔ¨Åc rules, subways that have been constructed since the modernization period under the heavy inÔ¨Çuences from Western cultures, especially the United States, have adopted the Right-hand TrafÔ¨Åc rules. The inconsistent trafÔ¨Åc di- rection rules across transportation modes have caused public confusion, indicating potential problems emerging amidst the effort to construct a connecting line between the Right-hand sub- ways and the Left-hand railroad systems. There has been little research on the effects of pedestrians‚Äô walking directions. Reviewing the scant research on such subject, Gipps and Marksjo (1985) presented a model for the interactions between pedestrians, which was intended for the use of graphical computer simulation. Helbing (1991) simulated on computers that the movements of pedestrians are supposed to show certain reg- ularities, which can be best described by an algorithm for the in- dividual behavior. This behavior is assumed to be determined by an intended velocity, by several attractive and repulsive effects and by Ô¨Çuctuations. The movement of pedestrians is dependent on de- cisions, which have the purpose of optimizing their behavior and can be explicitly modeled. In other words, previous studies have focused on pedestrians‚Äô behaviors and interactions between pe- destrians based on computer simulations or a mathematic model. Ergonomics studies, such as those conducted by Johansson and Rumar (1968), Owens et al. (1994), and Shinar (1984, 1985), have especially focused on the visibility. Finnis and Walton (2008) and Kretz et al. (2006) have focused on the effects of pedestrian walking speeds. Kretz et al. (2006) conducted a pedestrian counterÔ¨Çow  experiment in a corridor. The participants were divided into two groups of varying size and walked in opposite directions through a corridor. The video footage taken during the experiment was used to evaluate the passing times, walking speeds, Ô¨Çuxes and lane formations, and symmetry breakings within a corridor. Their re- sults included that the increment of counterÔ¨Çow percentage affected the time, speed and Ô¨Çux factors in various experimental situations. Although some research has been conducted in relation to pe- destrians, studies have lacked in examinations of walking di- rections and pedestrians‚Äô natural preferences. Lucas (2012, p. 18) states that ‚Äúmost people are right-handed, which leads to a natural tendency to favor one side of the road or another depending on the means of transportation being used.‚Äù As demonstrated in Table 1, the majority of the listed countries have uniÔ¨Åed the direction au- tomobiles and pedestrians ought to observe. In fact, many countries including the United States, Canada, Sweden, Austria and Great Britain, have adopted the Right-side TrafÔ¨Åc policies as their fundamental walking directions in consideration of the greater percentage of right-handed people. Therefore, even in Korea, where current walking rules conform to the Left-side TrafÔ¨Åc policy, revolving doors, airport entrances and exits, moving walks, esca- lators and subway turnstiles move to the right, abiding by the in- ternational standards. However, people who are accustomed to the ‚ÄúPeople to the left, automobiles on the right‚Äù rule, which has been instructed since elementary trafÔ¨Åc rule education, tend to feel perplexed when exposed to facilities that move towards the right. This is due to the inconsistencies between the left-side walking stipulations and right-side entries and exists, hence causing confusion between incoherent trafÔ¨Åc lines. Especially, as people are accustomed to walking on the left side in subway alleys, when they approach subway turnstiles, frequent collisions occur between pedestrians walking from opposite sides. Therefore, as in- conveniences caused by clashing into approaching pedestrians emerge due to the inconsistent walking rules, unifying trafÔ¨Åc rules would not only prevent confusion between trafÔ¨Åc lines but also are expected to increase walking speeds. Although accidents caused by confusion resulting from the in- consistencies between walking and driving directions generally are not fatal, such problems tend to cause inconveniences in people‚Äôs daily lives. Especially, in the event of urgent circumstances such as conÔ¨Çagration accidents in small alleys, consistent walking rules are imperative for prompt evacuation. Therefore, standardizing pe- destrians‚Äô walking directions by regulation is of paramount importance, and its stipulations ought to reÔ¨Çect different trans- portation modes, human expectations and population stereotypes, hence leading to the necessities of further research on such topics. The current study was conducted in two phases in 2009, one year prior to the amendment of walking direction regulations. The Ô¨Årst phase included observational research of 1000 Korean pedes- trians to examine walking characteristics of today‚Äôs pedestrians towards public walking facilities in 10 different situations. In the  
H.S.  Jung, H.-S.  Jung / Applied Ergonomics 44 (2013) 1015e1023  1017  second phase, survey questionnaires were distributed to six hun- dred Korean people sub-divided according to gender and afÔ¨Åliated age groups, in order to administer statistical analysis in relation to walking directions and examine pedestrians‚Äô preferred walking direction, depending on the locations and facilities. Additionally, subjective opinions and feedback were asked regarding the pro- posed change in walking regulations, depending on human char- acteristics including dominant hand and foot. Therefore, the current study attempted to examine the drawbacks of the left-side walking rules stipulated at the time of the research and to further provide recommendations on trafÔ¨Åc law improvements in relation to walking rules by illuminating safer and more convenient alter- natives, basing information on what people prefer according to their physical and psychological characteristics.  2. Research method  2.1.  Subjects  In the Ô¨Årst phase of the study 1000 Korean pedestrians were observed in order to investigate their walking characteristics in public walking facilities. 50 people were randomly selected for observation in each of the two similar observation sites for 10 different situations, regardless of age or gender. The ten different situations were walking on pedestrian-only roads, walking on non- distinguished roadways and sidewalks, using crosswalks, walking the corridors in public buildings, walking upstairs, walking down- stairs, entering buildings though entrances, exiting buildings through exits, entering elevators, and exiting elevators. In the second phase, to examine the pedestrians‚Äô natural preferences for walking directions, a total of 600 respondents participated. The respondents‚Äô ages varied from 12 to 83, and the average ages (standard deviation) are shown in Table 2. Six hundred respondents were subdivided into six age groups through quota sampling (i.e., 10s, 20s, 30s, 40s, 50s and over 60 years), with 50 male and 50 female subjects in each age group. For example, age group ‚Äò10s‚Äô included 100 respondents of 50 males and 50 females from ages 10 to 19, ‚Äò20s‚Äô included 100 respondents of 50 males and 50 females from ages 20 to 29, and so on. In order to minimize research bias on population stereotype examination, locations for subject selections were not limited to any particular places. Instead, the survey was conducted at different places even for the same or similar facilities. Locations in metropolitan cities were selected for their convenient public facilities and public transportation systems which were used by a number of people.  2.2.  Procedures  In the Ô¨Årst phase of the study, which was to observe pedestrians‚Äô dispositions, two similar observation sites were selected for each of the ten different situations in public walking facilities listed in the previous section. Two groups of Ô¨Åeld researchers were paired up for each observation site to Ô¨Åll in the checkboxes, unnoticed by the  pedestrians who were being observed. The check sheet included two checkboxes, right or left walking directions. In order to establish inter-observer reliability when a pedestrian walked somewhat along the middle of the road, the observation was recorded only when the two observers agreed which side of the road the pedestrian walked on or when he or she walked to the right or left side of the road in order to avoid collision with another pedestrian who was walking in the opposite direction. A total of 1000 pedestrians were observed, 50 at each location, regardless of age or gender. The observation was conducted for ten days and the observation time was set at 10:00 a.m. to avoid any external effects such as rush hour. In the second phase of the study, where surveys were conducted on walking direction preference, face-to-face, one-on-one surveys with the respondents were conducted to minimize response errors. In order to reduce carry-over effects, different Ô¨Åeld researchers and pedestrians from those in the Ô¨Årst phase of the study participated in the surveys. Each individual survey began with a brief explana- tion to the respondents of the study objectives, the survey method and procedures involved, and the non-disclosure rule of personal information including names. Consent was obtained from each respondent prior to starting the survey questions. To conduct the survey, Ô¨Åeld researchers Ô¨Årst Ô¨Ålled in the gender checkboxes in the data collection sheet. Respondents were then asked about their age and their dominant hand and foot. There were three dominant hand options for the respondents to choose from: right-handed, left-handed, or ambidextrous; and two dominant foot options, right or left. Their answers were taken without further informal observations. Then, they were asked about their preferred walking direction (right/left) in using ten different public walking facilities as speciÔ¨Åed in the ‚ÄòSubject‚Äô section. They were also asked about their preferred standing side when moving through escalators and moving walks. The Ô¨Åeld researchers Ô¨Ålled in the checkboxes for each answer. The questionnaires also included two open-ended questions: One was ‚Äòshould there be a uniÔ¨Åed rule for walking di- rections, and if so, which side do you think it should be?‚Äô and the other asked for respondents‚Äô opinions and feedback on the prop- osition of amendment in walking directions from left to right, proposed by the MLTMAK, local governments and civil rights movement.  2.3. Data analysis  In order to analyze the data for current dispositions and preferred walking directions, descriptive and inferential statistical analyses such as the Chi-squared test, the ANOVA, and the paired t- test were administered to examine the relationships between walking characteristics and age, gender, and dominant hand and foot. The level of signiÔ¨Åcance was set at 5% for all statistical analyses.  3. Results  3.1.

The results showed that all age groups preferred walking on the right in all locations, as shown in Table 5. As for the preferred walking direction in different locations by age group, no statistical signiÔ¨Åcance was found from the Chi- squared test, same as walking characteristics by gender, except for the roads with no boundaries between roadways and sidewalks (p ¬º .019).  3.4. Preferred walking directions depending on location and dominant hand and foot  Of the six hundred respondents who participated in the current research, 460 (76.7%) were right-handed, 63 (10.5%) left-handed and 77 (12.8%) ambidextrous. Analyzed by gender and age group, males were relatively more prone to be left-handed or ambidex- trous, while females were more likely to be right-handed. However, no signiÔ¨Åcant discrepancies were found across different age groups. The results from the ANOVA test showed no statistical signiÔ¨Åcance for gender (p ¬º .073), age (p ¬º .487), or interaction effects (p ¬º .416). Of the 92 (15.3%) left-footed respondents, the number of males was 56 (9.3%), relatively higher than that of females, 36 (6.0%), similar to the tendencies found in dominant hands. The results from the Chi-squared tests also showed a signiÔ¨Åcant effect  Table 4 Preferred walking directions depending on location and gender.

(p ¬º .023). Nonetheless, the differences of dominant foot by age group were not signiÔ¨Åcant. The results from the ANOVA test did not show signiÔ¨Åcant effects of age groups (p ¬º .508) or interaction ef- fects between gender and age group (p ¬º .174). In regard to pedestrians‚Äô preferences depending on their dominant hand, Table 6 shows that of all the survey respondents, 5.7% were left-handed and preferred walking on the left side, which was higher percentage than the 4.8% who were left-handed and preferred walking on the right side. In other words, 54.3% of the left-handed preferred walking on the left side while 45.7% of the left-handed preferred walking on the right side. As for the ambidextrous respondents, 4.3% of the respondents, or 33.6% of the ambidextrous, preferred walking on the left, signiÔ¨Åcantly lower than the 8.5% of the respondents, or 66.4% of the ambi- dextrous, who preferred the right side. Not surprisingly, 51.6% of the respondents who were right-handed, or 67.3% of the right- handed, preferred walking on the right side, signiÔ¨Åcantly higher than the 25.1%, or 32.7% of the right-handed, who preferred the left side. Similar to the Ô¨Åndings about the dominant hand, of all the survey respondents, 7.9% were left-footed and preferred walking on the left side, slightly higher than the 7.4% who were left-footed and preferred walking on the right side. In other words, 51.6% of the left-footed preferred walking on the left side whereas 48.3% of the left-footed preferred walking on the right side. As found in right- handed respondents, 57.5% of the respondents that were right- footed (or 32.1% of the right-footed) preferred walking on the right side, twice of the 27.2% of the respondents (or 67.9% of total right-footed) who were right-footed and preferred walking on the left side. The results from the Chi-squared test for the effects of the dominant hand and foot in different locations are shown in Table 6. The dominant hand showed statistical signiÔ¨Åcance in all selected locations, except for crossroads, whereas the dominant foot was signiÔ¨Åcant in all selected locations except for crossroads, walking downstairs and exiting elevators.  3.5. Opinions on walking directions by gender and by age group  Of the six hundred respondents surveyed, regardless of the walking locations, 158 (26.3%) preferred walking on the left side while 442 (73.7%) preferred the right side (Table 7). Table 8 shows the relationships between the dominant hand and foot and their effects on walking directions. The results indicate that the combinations of the left dominant hand with the left dominant foot (7.7%), ambidextrous with the right dominant foot (10%), or the right dominant hand with the right dominant foot (72%) were higher than the other way around. Regarding the preferred walking direction, respondents preferred walking on the right side (56%) except for those with left dominant hand and foot (4.3%).  3.6. Feedback on the amendment of directions  the regulations of walking  Of the six hundred respondents in the current research, 411 (68.5%) supported the shift to the Right-side TrafÔ¨Åc policy.  3.7. Results on the walking directions of walking-related sports groups  Roads that do not indicate trafÔ¨Åc directions or post signs commonly found in walking trails and riverside sidewalks are prone to cause transport inconveniences among joggers, bikers and in-line skaters. The current study surveyed different sports groups  
and clubs in order to examine their preferred moving direction. Results suggested that in-line skater club members preferred Right- side TrafÔ¨Åc rules, while biking club members were riding on the right side, as stipulated by Article 2 Section 16 of the trafÔ¨Åc law that states bicycles by deÔ¨Ånition are included in the ‚Äòvehicle‚Äô category, and are therefore required to abide by the Right-side TrafÔ¨Åc pol- icies. Joggers also advocated the Right-side TrafÔ¨Åc rules, while climbers did not show a particular preference, as mountains dras- tically differ from lands in that uniÔ¨Åed left/right walking rules are not as applicable because walking directions could alternate depending on the other climbers coming from the opposite direc- tion and the location of the ropes the climbers hold onto.  3.8.  Summary of results  The current research observed 1000 Korean pedestrians, whose walking directions were observed. An additional six hundred re- spondents participated in a survey that examined their preferred walking direction at different public facilities commonly used on a daily basis. The following are a summary of the Ô¨Åndings in this study.  (1) Before the amendment, the majority of pedestrians walked on the left side. (2) The majority of pedestrians preferred walking on the right side, regardless of the location. (3) No signiÔ¨Åcant differences were found in the preferred walking direction by age or gender.  (4) SigniÔ¨Åcant discrepancies in the preferred walking direction depending on pedestrians‚Äô dominant hand and foot exist, with left-handed and footed pedestrians more inclined to the Left- hand TrafÔ¨Åc rules, while right-handed and footed are more likely to walk on the right side. Additionally, the dominant hand appears to have a greater impact on the pedestrian‚Äôs preferred walking direction than the dominant foot. (5) When asked for feedback on the proposed uniÔ¨Åcation of walking directions, respondents expressed their preference for the Right-hand TrafÔ¨Åc rules. (6) Regarding the current proposition to change walking directions from left to right, advocates outnumbered those in opposition, and younger generations (10se20s) showed greater support towards the amendment.  4. Discussion  Facilities, environments, devices and tools are supposed to be designed in such a way that they can be used conveniently and be easily assembled, built and installed with no confusion involved in the process of their usage. In order to accomplish this usability objective, it is imperative to thoroughly understand the frequent errors involved in using such instruments and to examine the user‚Äôs expectations and preferences involved in their usages. The main objective of this study was thus to investigate the stereotypes of Koreans regarding the preferred walking direction when encountering various public walking facilities and provide useful information to pedestrians and trafÔ¨Åc policy legislators.

Walking dispositions depending on walking locations  The greater percentage of walking on the left is inferred due to the education commonly received at school and social trafÔ¨Åc safety policies that had stressed the Left-side TrafÔ¨Åc rules since 1921. However, regarding the walking directions according to the loca- tion, more pedestrians walked on the right side rather than on the left in walking on crossroads, walking upstairs and entering entrance doors. Such particular preferences to walk on the right side at crossroads, in spite of the country‚Äôs trafÔ¨Åc stipulations to walk on the left side, can be explained due to what the National Police Agency of Korea (2003) had recommended since March, 1993, because pedestrians on crossroads can reduce the danger of being hit by an on-coming car on the right side of the road. Meanwhile, the results regarding walking upstairs or entering building entrances seem to indicate that as a majority of people are righthanded, they prefer walking on the right side in those loca- tions in order to hold onto staircase railings and doorknobs with their right hand. Subsequent to the Ô¨Åndings examined in this paper, another survey was conducted in March 2012. An additional 1000 pedes- trians were observed, approximately one and a half years after the regulation was changed in July 2010, to investigate the changes in walking directions of the pedestrians since the regulation change. Exactly the same method, procedure and observing locations were employed as in the previous observation (before the regulation change). The results revealed that 72.4% of the 1000 pedestrians observed walked on the right side, compared to 40.7% in the pre- vious observation. Looking into the ten speciÔ¨Åc situations, the new percentages showed: pedestrian-only walking on roads (77.5%), using non-distinguished roadways and sidewalks (65.3%), using crosswalks (74.2%), walking the corridors in public buildings (71.1%), walking upstairs (77.6%), walking downstairs (65.8%), entering buildings though entrances (74.4%), exiting buildings through exits (75.2%), entering elevators (70.5%) and exiting ele- vators (72.5%). Compared to the previous results, these Ô¨Ågures show that the majority pedestrians abided by the newly established rules although 1 in 4 still did not. It can be inferred that the results  were due to the government‚Äôs ongoing publicity and the majority of right-handed peoples‚Äô natural preference.  4.2. Preferred walking directions depending on the location and gender  64.9% of the respondents preferred walking on the right side across different walking locations, supporting the implementation of Right-side TrafÔ¨Åc rules. It appears that despite the compulsory obligation to walk on the left side at the time the study was con- ducted, the actual preferred walking direction for the pedestrians was on the right side. When analyzed by gender, although slight differences between males and females were found in preference for walking direction depending on walking locations, they did not reach the statistical signiÔ¨Åcance level. Therefore, the gender factor is not a major consideration in establishing rules for walking direction.  4.3. Preferred walking directions depending on the location and age group  Besides the statistical analysis on walking direction by gender, each age group was also analyzed to investigate any patterns or characteristics among the stratiÔ¨Åcation variables. The results indi- cated that all age groups preferred walking on the right in all locations. As to the preferred walking direction in different locations by age group, no statistical signiÔ¨Åcances were found from the Chi- squared test, as for walking characteristics by gender, except for the roads with no boundaries between roadways and sidewalks (p ¬º .019). Therefore, the age group factor cannot be a major consideration in establishing rules for walking direction either.  4.4. Relationship between dominant hand (/foot) and preferred walking directions  It has been argued that human sensory and behavioral dispo- sitions differ according to one‚Äôs dominant hand, foot and eye (Augustyn and Peters, 1986; Brown and Taylor, 1988). While small differences exist across different ethnic backgrounds, approxi- mately 90% of human population is right-handed (Barsley, 1970; Previc and Saucedo, 1991). According to the Gallup Korea (2004) research results, 4% of Koreans are left-handed, 8% are ambidex- trous and the remaining 88% are right-handed, while Jung and Jung (2009) stated that 5.8% are left-handed, 7.9% ambidextrous and 86.3% right-handed. However, in this study, 76.7% of the re- spondents, a lower than expected portion, were shown to be right- handed. In regard to pedestrians‚Äô preferences for walking direction depending on their dominant hand, the results suggest that dominant hands play a signiÔ¨Åcant role in determining the natural preference for walking directions. Similar to the Ô¨Åndings about the dominant hand, left-footed respondents preferred walking on the  Table 8 Percentage of preferred walking direction depending on the composition of dominant hand and foot.

H.S.  Jung, H.-S.  Jung / Applied Ergonomics 44 (2013) 1015e1023  1021  left side more than walking on the right side. This is notable in that the Ô¨Ånding stresses how the dominant left foot can affect the pe- destrian‚Äôs preference for walking on the left side. The results from the Chi-squared test for the effects of the dominant hand and foot in different locations showed the domi- nant hand showed statistical signiÔ¨Åcance in most selected loca- tions. These results indicate the greater impact the dominant hand plays over the dominant foot on the respondents‚Äô preferences for walking directions, which is consistent with Lucas‚Äô (2012, p. 18) assertion, in his comment on historical questions, that stated ‚Äúmost people are right-handed, which leads to a natural tendency to favor one side of the road or another depending on the means of trans- portation being used.‚Äù As to the differences in preference when entering and exiting the same location, the results of the Chi-squared test showed sta- tistical signiÔ¨Åcance between entering and exiting elevators (p ¬º .001) but not between walking upstairs and downstairs (p ¬º .259) or entering and exiting buildings (p ¬º .068). In addition, the preferred walking direction depending on locations by gender (male p ¬º .05, female p ¬º .018), age group (30s p ¬º .004, over 60 years p ¬º .040), handedness (right-handed p ¬º .002) and footed- (right-footed p ¬º .001) ness showed statistical signiÔ¨Åcance for entering and leaving elevators. However, no other conditions were signiÔ¨Åcant except for age groups in walking upstairs and down- stairs (30s p ¬º .004) and for footedness in entering and exiting p ¬º .029). buildings (right-footed Frequency analysis results showed a higher percentage of compliance with Right-side TrafÔ¨Åc rules when walking upstairs and entering buildings and elevators than their counter-actions (walking downstairs and exiting build- ings and elevators). This higher preference for walking to the right side engaging a particular action despite the identical location is explained due to the higher percentage of right-handed people and respondents‚Äô natural inclination to hold staircase railings located on the right side in order to conveniently walk upstairs, while staying on the right side in elevators to push the switch located on the right side. Additionally, in the cases of subways, escalators, or moving walks, the current custom allows pedestrians who are in a rush to pass other standing pedestrians on the left side (stand right, walk left), being interpreted as ‚Äòpassersby on the left,‚Äô identically applied to automobile transportation norms. 402 (67%) respondents preferred the right side for the facilities that allow transporting while standing still such as escalators and moving walks. Additional Chi-squared test results on preferred standing side showed different signiÔ¨Åcance by age (p ¬º .722), gender (p ¬º .225), dominant hand (p ¬º .008) and dominant foot (p ¬º .001). These results indicate that the preferred standing position is different according to the dominant hand and foot, which is similar to the results on the preferred walking direction in various walking locations. Contrary to other walking locations, not only do right-handed (69.6%), right- footed (69.9%) and ambidextrous (62%) respondents, but also the left-handed (54%) and left-footed (61.0%) respondents prefer the right side for locations with the facilities that allow mobility while standing. Nonetheless, due to concern about the higher risk of falls and potential injury when walking upstairs or downstairs on es- calators or moving walks, Korea and other countries have recently been promoting an abandonment of walking behaviors while transporting through such facilities. An additional analysis was conducted to Ô¨Ånd the correlation between the dominant hand and foot of the individuals. The results showed that of 600 respondents, 460 (82.4%) were right-handed, 63 left-handed, and 77 ambidextrous. Of 460 right-handers, 431 (82.4%) were right-footed and 29 (17.6%) were left-footed. Of 63 left-handers, 17 (27.0%) were right-footed and 46 (73.0%) were left- footed, and of 77 ambidextrous respondents, 60 (78.0%) were right-  footed and 17 (22.0%) were left-footed. The results showed a high correlation between handedness and footedness. Interestingly, the ambidextrous were approximately 3.5 times more likely to be right-footed than left-footed. The results from the Chi-squared test showed a signiÔ¨Åcant effect (p ¬º .001) between the dominant hand and foot. Moreover, the results from the Chi-squared test for the effects of interaction among the dominant hand and dominant foot and all different locations also showed a signiÔ¨Åcant effect (p ¬º .001).  4.5.  Feedback on the uniÔ¨Åcation of walking direction  The results of our survey on the uniÔ¨Åcation of walking direction regardless of walking locations showed 73.7% preferred the right side (Table 7). This Ô¨Ånding indicates the slightly higher inclination than those actually walking on the right side in different locations, which was 64.9% as shown in Table 4. The overall preference regardless of different locations showed higher but when it comes to the speciÔ¨Åc situations such as walking downstairs, exiting buildings and elevators, the preferences were lower. Therefore, if the right-side trafÔ¨Åc rule is adopted, then more careful consider- ation should be provided such as signs and information posts for these locations. As demonstrated in Table 7, the preferred walking directions by age and gender did not show signiÔ¨Åcant differences. The Chi- squared tests also showed no signiÔ¨Åcant effects of age groups (p ¬º .875) and gender (p ¬º .711). However, the effects of natural preferences for walking directions depending on the dominant hand and foot appeared to be robustly signiÔ¨Åcant (p < .001). The analysis on the relationships between the dominant hand and foot and their effects on walking directions revealed that the respondents preferred walking on the right side except for those with left hand and foot dominance. Especially those who had the right dominant hand and foot showed the highest preference level. And, those who were ambidextrous preferred walking on the right regardless of their dominant foot. The results from the two-way ANOVA revealed no statistical signiÔ¨Åcance (p ¬º .241) of the effect of the dominant hand and foot on the uniÔ¨Åcation of walking directions.  4.6. Feedback on the amendment of directions  the regulations of walking  According to a recent survey by a newspaper on the idea of changing the walking direction from left to right in order to be in- line with the international custom and to secure walking safety, 67.3% of the respondents ‚Äòopposed‚Äô while 21.2% ‚Äòsupported‚Äô the idea (Joongang Newspaper, 31 March 2007). However, this study revealed that 411 (68.5%) supported the shift to the Right-side TrafÔ¨Åc policy, showing inconsistent results with the previous sur- vey. The discrepancies seem to result from the different methods employed in the newspaper survey, where 700 people of 19 and over across the country were randomly surveyed over the phone. Therefore, the newspaper survey and the current research show differences in the subject population and the reliability of the research method. In addition, the survey data was collected before the ofÔ¨Åcial announcement and promotion on the merits of walking on the right side or the effects of changing the walking directions. Therefore, without much public discussion on walking on the right side, the respondents might have shown certain fear or general reluctance for changing long-standing customs or existing systems. Moreover, the results from the Chi-squared test regarding the amendment of the regulations of walking directions did not show statistical signiÔ¨Åcance by the age groups (p ¬º .165) or by gender (p ¬º .930). However, discrepancies between the supporting and  
1022  H.S.  Jung, H.-S.  Jung / Applied Ergonomics 44 (2013) 1015e1023  opposing viewpoints for different age groups appeared to be greater than for gender differences, with respondents in their 10s (70%) and 20s (79%) generally giving more positive feedback than those in their 30s to over 60 years (63e69%). The higher percentage of consent shown by the younger generation can be inferred due to their positive and open-minded attitude towards changes. The dominant hand and foot revealed signiÔ¨Åcant effects on feedback (p < .005) consistent with the results from the previous studies. Nonetheless, the results from the two-way ANOVA did not show signiÔ¨Åcant effects of the dominant hand and foot on the feedback on changing walking direction rules (p ¬º .634).  5.  Conclusion and limitations  The current research showed that the Right-hand TrafÔ¨Åc rules are explained to be the majority of peoples‚Äô natural disposition. As the majority of the global population is right-handed, walking on the left side when carrying personal belongings such as bags and umbrellas in one‚Äôs right hand can increase the risks of colliding into another pedestrian walking from the opposite side. Therefore, the Right-side TrafÔ¨Åc rule can be said to be more adequate from the human anatomical perspective since it Ô¨Åts more with the majority of people‚Äôs physical characteristics. Consideration for minorities (Barsley, 1970; Jung and Jung, 2009) is of paramount importance for a well-functioning and sus- tainable society, such as regulations that stipulate manufacturing products for left-handed people. However, in order to help build a safer society and reduce public nuisances, it is more crucial to make such different and diverse approaches that can beneÔ¨Åt the society as a whole. Different walking regulations in different facilities (co- existence of Left-side and Right-side TrafÔ¨Åc systems) would amplify confusion for pedestrians, hence drastically increasing the risks of accidental collisions. For instance, while bicycles are enforced to be ridden on the right side as they are included in the vehicle category, the majority of walking and jogging trails do not separate the road for pedestrians and bikers. Therefore, different requirements on directions between the two would more likely cause confusion and higher risks of collisions. However, as people are more inclined to losing balance when walking upstairs or downstairs, thereby increasing the risks of falling, walking on the left side on stairs is considered to be safer. This is because ordinary stairs generally place their railings on the inner side, and holding onto the railings when walking downstairs, hence walking on the left side, helps people keep balance and avoid missteps. Therefore, as certain walking locations including staircases could cause safety problems, should all walking directions be uniÔ¨Åed to the right side, placing the railings not only on the inner side but also on the outer edge would be highly recommended. Therefore, it is highly recommended to establish a uniÔ¨Åed rule to allow pedestrians to safely walk through any pathways, including pedestrian walks, subway allays, corridors, stairs and narrow paths, without collisions with another passenger walking from the opposite direction, particularly in emergencies should they abruptly occur. However, should left-side walks be necessary under special circumstances, walking guides or road signs must be provided in order to properly inform and lead the pedestrians. The current study attempted to examine the issues and concerns associated with the new Right-side TrafÔ¨Åc rules in Korea, which was a highly controversial issue at the time of the study just before its implementation and to further suggest how to improve road and trafÔ¨Åc laws and policy making by exploring safe walking directions that most pedestrians prefer. Previous studies, both domestic and international, have left this subject of study mainly unexplored. With little reference available on pedestrians‚Äô walking character- istics, the current study could contribute to promoting safety and  efÔ¨Åciency of pedestrians in the future by providing useful infor- mation and data for other countries in legislating trafÔ¨Åc policies. The pedestrians‚Äô walking behavior and preferences presented in this paper might be culturally speciÔ¨Åc to Korea, which has a strong cultural bias against left-handedness. From East to West, the reality is that right-handedness is preferred to left-handedness, and many groundless prejudices about the latter do exist (Zverev, 2006). Moreover, there is considerable social and cultural prejudice to- ward the left-handed as reported by Kang (1994) and Perelle and Ehrman (1994), ‚ÄúKorea is one of the countries in which cultural bias against use of the left hand remains strong.‚Äù For the Korean population, Jung and Jung (2009) reported 5.8% were left-handed whereas Kang (1994) reported that only 0.59% and 1.66% were non-right-handed for writing and drawing, respectively. World- wide, most established and accepted statistics show between 8 and 12% of the population (Hardyck and Petrinovich, 1977; Perelle and Ehrman, 1994; Reiss and Reiss, 1999) as left-handed. However, wide deviations from 0.6 to 19.8% do exist in different cultural and ethnic groups (Gotestam, 1990; Porac et al., 1990). This means that the percentages of the left-handed population in different cultural and ethnic groups might affect walking behavior and preferences, which are closely related to handedness, as shown in this study. It is thus suggested that the Ô¨Åndings of the study be carefully consid- ered when applied to different cultural and ethnic groups. In addition, this study was limited to 10 selected facilities that were used to determine the preference for walking directions, thereby suggesting that future surveys include more comprehensive and speciÔ¨Åc facilities and situations. More studies are called for in the future, incorporating diverse factors, including studies on: trafÔ¨Åc safety based on statistics, e.g., the effect of walking directions on pedestrian accident rate; bio- physical reactions such as heartbeat rates, muscle activities and brain wave changes; walking convenience and social efÔ¨Åciency based on simulation analyses of walking speed, collision fre- quencies and walking densities; and changes in pedestrians‚Äô per- ceptions and actual accident rates after an amendment to their trafÔ¨Åc laws.

s0003687013000768,"  Nearly 12,000 individuals are treated in U.S. emergency de- partments each year for snow shovelling-related injuries (Watson et al., 2011). The most common anatomical region for shovelling- related injury is the lower-back. SpeciÔ¨Åcally, a retrospective study has shown that lower-back injuries account for 34.3% of all snow shovelling injuries, and in most cases, the injury is due to muscu- loskeletal overexertion, affecting soft tissues (Watson et al., 2011). Mechanically, this overexertion may be represented as increased joint loading in the lower-back. Therefore, biomechanical design of an ergonomic shovel that can decrease these joint loads may have implications for low-back injury prevention.  * Corresponding author.

E-mail address:  Perhaps the most common ergonomic snow shovel that is available for purchase is the bent-shaft shovel, which includes a downward bend in the shovel shaft. Despite the retail of bent-shaft shovels, no scientiÔ¨Åc evidence exists to support its use in terms of reducing mechanical loading at the lower-back. McGorry et al. (2003) studied bent-shaft shovels from a kinematic perspective, and found that a bent-shaft shovel signiÔ¨Åcantly reduced upper body Ô¨Çexion when compared to the more common straight-shaft shovel. Huang and Paquet (2002) reported similar results. It has been speculated that the decrease in upper body Ô¨Çexion associated with bent-shaft shovel use would also decrease lumbar joint mo- ments (McGorry et al., 2003); however, to the best of our knowl- edge, no study to date has tested this hypothesis. Although peak joint moments provide an instantaneous indi- cation of the mechanical loads that occur at a joint, they do not provide cumulative load information. For overuse injuries, such as low-back pain, a measure of cumulative loading such as angular impulse (integral of moments with respect to time) may provide more relevant information (Schipplein et al., 1990; Stefanyshyn  0003-6870/$ e see front matter √ì 2013 Elsevier Ltd and The Ergonomics Society.

Therefore, the purpose of this study was to determine if a bent-shaft shovel inÔ¨Çuences angular impulses about the L5/S1 joint during a shovelling task. It was hypothesized that L5/S1 extension angular impulses would be decreased with bent-shaft shovel use compared to a straight-shaft snow shovel.  2. "
s000368701300077x,"  Motor-vehicle crashes are the leading cause of death for chil- dren in the U.S. ages 3e18 (Subramanian, 2003). In 2008, 1633 children under the age of 16 died and 220,000 were injured as a result of motor-vehicle crashes in the U.S. (NHTSA, 2009). The use of a child restraint system (CRS) reduces the likelihood of fatality in a towaway crash by 71% for infants and 54% for toddlers, depending primarily on the restraint type and orientation (NHTSA, 2002). Several studies have documented high rate child restraint sys- tems (CRS) ‚Äúmisuse‚Äù, which includes a large range of both safety- critical and minor deviations from manufacturers‚Äô instructions and best practices on installation and use (Eby and Kostyniuk, 1999; Decina and Lococo, 2005; Koppel and Charlton, 2009; Lane et al., 2000). Over 20 types of misuse have been identiÔ¨Åed, with loose vehicle installation and loose restraint harness consistently  * Corresponding author. E-mail address: kklinich@umich.edu (K.D.

(2000) surveyed the CRS installations for 109 subjects and found that 84% had between 1 and 3 installation errors with an average of 2 errors per installation. Several studies have identiÔ¨Åed factors correlated with misuse. Koppel and Charlton (2009) found statistically signiÔ¨Åcant differ- ences in misuse rates between CRS types, with forward-facing (FF) harness restraints having the higher observed level of misuse than rear-facing (RF) seats or belt-positioning boosters. Brown et al. (2010a, 2010b) found higher frequencies of misuse and higher numbers of errors per installation in convertible child restraints compared to those used in a single mode. Eby and Kostyniuk (1999) found that higher levels of misuse were associated with lower educational levels, situations where the driver was not the child‚Äôs legal guardian, the number of times that the seat was moved/ reinstalled into different vehicles, and children who were younger and smaller. Lane et al. (2000) found a trend for less misuse with higher education attainment level and participation in a private insurance program.

(2009) examined the amount of physical force required to perform child restraint installations and suggested that the high amounts of exertion needed may contribute to installation error. Several tactics have been employed to improve child passenger safety (CPS), reduce misuse and increase use of CRS in the US. Since 2000, at least 38 states and the District of Columbia have improved and upgraded their child restraint laws, which has substantially improved the overall CRS usage rate and particularly increased booster seat use (SafeKids Worldwide, 2007; Decina and Lococo, 2005). However, while laws tend to increase usage, they do not necessarily increase correct usage (Brixey et al., 2010). In 1998, the National Highway TrafÔ¨Åc Safety Administration (NHTSA) intro- duced their National Child Passenger Safety certiÔ¨Åcation training program that has established a cadre of specially-trained child seat technicians across the nation to educate parents/caregivers and be advocates for safe travel practices for children. These programs have increased the availability of hands-on CRS instructional op- portunities that have been shown to be a more effective educa- tional method than information alone (Lane et al., 2000).  of the Lower Anchorages and Tethers for CHildren (LATCH) system for securing CRS in vehicles has helped reduce misuse in some instances but has also led to new forms of misuse (Decina and Lococo, 2007). In the US, LATCH consists of a pair of dedicated lower anchors near the vehicle seat bight plus a top-tether anchor located behind the vehicle seatback. Child restraints are now equipped with hardware that usually consists of a LATCH strap (webbing with connectors on either end) that replaces the seatbelt as the primary means of securement and a tether strap that offers a third point of attachment. In situations where top-tether use was required and all the tether hardware was available, only 51% of those surveyed were using the top tether. Loose tethers were observed in 18% of cases and loose LATCH straps (attached to the lower anchor- ages) were seen in 30% of cases. In 20% of cases, CRS were installed using both LATCH and seatbelt, which is considered to be misuse. The NHTSA has established an ease-of-use rating system for CRS (NHTSA, 2002, 2006) in an effort to encourage CRS manufacturers to include features that may reduce misuse and enhance usability. The system provides an incentive for CRS manufacturers to improve products, labeling, and instruction manuals with respect to us- ability. As a result, many of the most difÔ¨Åcult-to-use CRS features are no longer produced and designs continue to evolve to improve usability. Features on CRS products have evolved as manufacturers have responded to the implementation of LATCH and NHTSA Ease-of- Use. This project was conducted to explore how CRS installation errors are affected by features on the most recent CRS systems, while considering subject factors of education and child restraint installation experience. The research questions are:   Do CRS features affect misuse rates?  Do CRS features affect the perceived ease-of-use?  Are CRS ease-of-use ratings correlated with misuse rates?  2. "
s0003687013000781,"  Since the marketplaces of many products have reached matu- rity, decisions taken by consumers while they are purchasing products are affected by key factors such as product usability and design novelty in addition to rudimentary factors such as func- tionality, performance, and economy. Therefore, it is increasingly important for manufacturers to design products that provide comfort and satisfaction to consumers in addition to the rudi- mentary beneÔ¨Åts (Jordan, 1998). Ergonomics or human factor methodologies are applied to product design in order to consider the satisfaction levels of consumers (H√§gg, 2003). Bio- instrumentation measurements such as the electromyogram (EMG), electroencephalogram (EEG), and electrocardiogram (ECG) are employed in ergonomic design to evaluate the usability of products quantitatively (ChafÔ¨Ån et al., 1999; Tsang and Vidulich, 2006). Among these, the surface EMG is frequently used for eval- uating physical stress and fatigue because of the noninvasive nature and ease of its measurement (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 1992). In general, surface EMGs of multiple mus- cles are measured when product usability and work fatigue  * Corresponding author. Tel.: √æ81 42 585 8685; fax: √æ81 42 583 5119.

For example, Kothiyal and Kayis (2001) measured surface EMGs of the biceps brachii, triceps brachii, anterior deltoid, posterior deltoid, and middle deltoid when moving weights, so as to deter- mine the effects of varying load magnitude and work rate on the muscular load in seated manual handling tasks performed with one hand. They concluded that each muscle load was dependent on the direction of movement and that it was difÔ¨Åcult to identify the preferred movement direction for all muscles. Herring and Hallbeck (2007) measured the Ô¨Çexor digitorum profundus, triceps brachii, biceps brachii, anterior deltoid, and posterior deltoid when pushing or pulling a shift lever, in order to determine the best location for the shift lever in a pushing and pulling task such as operating a manual transmission. From the results of measurements for pulling trials, a trade-off was found between the activity of the posterior deltoid and Ô¨Çexor digitorum profundus. These studies did not investigate a method for simultaneously evaluating multiple mus- cle loads. Eksioglu (2004) used the sum of multiple muscle loads as the indicator of comprehensive muscle load so as to determine the optimum grip span for a power grip exertion. However, it is possible that a particular muscle load dominates perceived total discomfort (hereafter referred to as the human satisfaction, or  0003-6870/$ e see front matter √ì 2013 Elsevier Ltd and The Ergonomics Society.

Also, the weighted sum with different amplitude of weight may affect the satisfaction. Therefore, the sum of multiple muscle loads may not always represent human satisfaction with muscle loads; thus it might not be suitable in the comprehensive evaluation of muscle loads. Ben-Gal and Bukchin (2002) and Nussbaum et al. (2009) combined multiple objectives (i.e., economic measures and ergo- nomic measures) into one objective. However, in these studies, multiple objectives were combined arbitrarily. Objective functions have been applied to estimate muscle loads with biomechanical models because an excessive number of muscles exists in relation to the mechanical degrees of freedom at the joints (Alexander, 2003; Erdemir et al., 2007; Herzog, 1996; Prilutsky and Zatsiorsky, 2002). The two common criteria are minimization of the sum of squared muscle-force divided by maximum muscle- force (Pedotti et al., 1978) or minimization of the sum of cubed muscle-force divided by cross-sectional muscle-area (Crowninshield and Brand, 1981). These objective functions are deÔ¨Åned for evaluating the strategy of a muscle activity, not for assessing the comfort of a human motion. Therefore, the objective functions already proposed for estimating muscle force are perhaps not appropriate for direct application to evaluating the burden that users feel. In previous studies (Chihara and Seo, 2011; Chihara et al., 2011), we proposed a simultaneous evaluation method for multiple muscle loads by applying the methodology of multi-objective optimization. Multiple muscle loads were deÔ¨Åned as objective functions that should be minimized, and the simultaneous muscle load evaluation of each consumer was formulated as a multi- objective optimization problem (MOOP). That is, the MOOPs were formulated for each consumer. The each consumer‚Äôs MOOP was solved and the optimum solution for each consumer was obtained. In general, optimum solutions for consumers do not correspond with each other; but we need to determine the only one design variable vector. We, therefore, introduced the concept of ‚Äúregret‚Äù (Yu, 1973; Yu and Leitmann, 1974). The regret is deÔ¨Åned as the difference from the optimum function value of the optimum solu- tion. Hence, if design variable vector corresponds to the optimum solution, the regret equals to zero; and the more the distance from design variable vector to the optimum solution increases, the more the regret increases. Obviously the regrets of consumers do not always correspond to zero when the one design variable vector is determined for all consumers. Then, the design problem to deter- mine one optimum solution for all consumers (hereafter referred to as the compromise solution) was formulated as the minimization of the maximum regret of consumers. The minemax problem in- dicates that the optimization of the problem makes objective function values for all consumers as close as possible to the objective function value of their each optimum solution. However, in previous studies, we considered only the muscle loads and did not conÔ¨Årm the degree of subjective satisfaction. That is, the relationship between the objective muscle loads and the subjective satisfaction levels was not clear. Thus, it is essential to develop the proposed method to evaluate the relationship between muscle loads and satisfaction levels. Therefore, the objective of the present study was to reveal the relationship between objective muscle load and subjective satisfaction levels. In this study, we derive an evaluation function of subjective satisfaction and eval- uate the satisfaction levels of participants. The proposed method will provide designers both subjective and objective information for ergonomic design problem, and help the decision making of designers. Design of a handrail position for the sit-to-stand movement is undertaken as the case study and conÔ¨Årms the ben- eÔ¨Åts of the proposed method.  2.  Evaluation of multiple muscle loads for ergonomic design  2.1. Overview of proposed method  First, multiple objective indicators are measured while partici- pants use a product or perform a task. Next, the response surfaces are predicted for objective indicators that are signiÔ¨Åcantly changed by design variable changes. In addition, the consistency between objective indicators and subjective satisfaction levels is evaluated, and the response surface of satisfaction scores is predicted as the satisfaction level function. Then, the simultaneous evaluation of objective indicators for each participant is formulated as a MOOP, and the optimum design solution for each participant is obtained. Finally, a compromise solution for all participants is obtained by considering the regrets of participants. Moreover, the satisfaction level at the obtained compromise solution is also calculated to support the decision making of designers. The proposed method will be described in greater detail in the following subsections. In addition, the muscle load is taken as the example of the objective indicator in the following description, because muscle load (or, EMG) is used in the application.  2.2. Measurement of surface EMGs  xi  (i ¬º 1, 2, ., nDES), which are unknown Design variables parameter to decide the design, are selected that possibly affect either the usability of an intended product or the work load of an intended task. It is noted that usability is deÔ¨Åned as ‚Äúthe extent to which a product can be used by speciÔ¨Åc users to achieve speciÔ¨Åed goals with effectiveness, efÔ¨Åciency, and satisfaction in a speciÔ¨Åed context of use‚Äù (ISO 9241-11, 1998). In other words, usability is the ease of use of a product; thus, physical effort is one of components that affect usability. Here, nDES represents the number of design variables. Then, multiple levels are set for each design variable. In addition, multiple muscles are selected that might contract while using the product or performing the task. The EMGs of the selected muscles are measured under all experimental conditions. More- over, the subjective satisfaction scores for each condition are collected.  2.3. Approximation of EMG response surfaces  Among the measured EMGs, those that exhibit signiÔ¨Åcant changes in response to design variable changes are selected. Here, nEMG represents the number of selected EMGs. The response sur- faces of the selected EMGs are approximated as follows:  bM j;k ¬º fj;k √∞x√û ¬º fj;k √∞x1 ; x2 ; .; xnDES √û  k ¬º 1; 2; .; nPAR√û  √∞j ¬º 1; 2; .; nEMG;  (1)  fj,k  nPAR  where bM j;k denotes the approximate value of the j-th EMG of the k- th participant and denotes the number of participants. Moreover, represents the response surface predicted by the radial basis function network (RBFN) (Orr, 1996). The RBFN per- forms well in terms of accuracy and robustness, irrespective of the degree of nonlinearity. Additionally, it is robust against experi- mental errors or noise (Jin et al., 2001). Thus, we consider the RBFN to be a dependable method for approximating the EMGs because the degree of nonlinearity in the EMGs is difÔ¨Åcult to predict, and measured EMGs unavoidably contain experimental errors and noise. In this study, the parameters proposed for the RBFN by Kitayama and Yamazaki (2011) are adopted.  
T. Chihara, A. Seo / Applied Ergonomics 45 (2014) 261e269  263  2.4. Approximation of satisfaction level  function  The response surface of the subjective evaluation scores on the total muscle load is approximated as the satisfaction level function. However, it is possible that the subjective and objective evaluation conÔ¨Çict each other. That is, the trend of objective muscle load and that of subjective evaluation do not correspond with each other. There are two possibilities when the objective and subjective eval- uation are in conÔ¨Çict. One is that the participants fail to properly assess their physical effort (i.e., muscle load in this paper); and the other case is that the participant‚Äôs subjective evaluation is affected by unexpected physical effort. We can eliminate the participant if it is the former case; and also eliminate if the number of participants who have discrepancy is vanishingly low. However, we need to reselect the objective indicator (or EMGs) if most of participants are affected by unexpected physical effort. Therefore, the number of participants that have discrepancy between the objective and sub- jective evaluation may be regarded as the indicator for the adequacy of selected EMGs. Thus, the consistency of muscle loads and satis- faction scores are evaluated. First, the muscle loads dominance relation of experimental conditions is evaluated. Next, the consis- tency index described below is calculated on the basis of the muscle loads dominance relation and the subjective satisfaction scores. We assume that there is no discrepancy between the objective and subjective evaluation when the consistency index exceeds some critical value. When the number of participants who fail to properly assess their sensation is relatively low, they are eliminated. That is, the consistency index is calculated and participants who have discrepancy are eliminated, so as to enhance the reliability of measured data on the assumption that both the subjective and objective evaluations are correct when they correspond. The satis- faction level function is approximated for each selected participants. To judge the relationship of solutions in a MOOP, the concept of domination is used (Deb, 2001). The solution A is said to dominate the other solution B, if the solution A is no worse than solution B in all objectives and is strictly better than solution B in at least one objective. Let us consider a two-objective optimization problem with three different solutions shown in Fig. 1. Both objective func- tions need to be minimized. In Fig. 1, if solutions A and B are to be compared, it is found that solution A is better than solution B in both objective functions. Thus, solution A dominates solution B. In addi- tion, if solutions A and C are to be compared, it is found that solution A is better than solution C in the Ô¨Årst objective function; conversely, solution A is worse than solution C in the second objective function. Hence, solutions A and C do not dominate each other. In this study, the consistency between objective and subjective evaluation is determined with comparing the muscle loads  f2 (minimize)  A  B  C  f1 (minimize)  Fig. 1. A population of three solutions.  dominance relation and the subjective satisfaction scores. Let us assume that the higher satisfaction score means better condition. Compared with solutions A and B in Fig. 1, there is no discrepancy between objective and subjective evaluation if the satisfaction score of solution A is larger than that of solution B. In addition, the objective and subjective evaluation conÔ¨Çict with each other if the satisfaction score of solution A is smaller than or equal to that of solution B. Compared with solutions A and C, it is difÔ¨Åcult to determine the consistency whatever the order of the satisfaction scores of solutions A and C. This is because there is no dominance relation between solution A and C. The smaller the number of conditions that the muscle loads dominance relation and satisfac- tion scores conÔ¨Çict with each other, the objective and subjective evaluation are more consistent with each other. Therefore, the consistency index on k-th participant is deÔ¨Åned as follows:  CIk ¬º 1   Nconf  k nEXP C2  (2)  Nconf k  where CIk denotes the consistency index for k-th participant, and is the number of discrepant conditions between the muscle loads dominance relation and the satisfaction scores. nEXP repre- sent the number of experimental conditions; thus nEXPC2 is the total combination number of two conditions in nEXP conditions. CIk exists within the range from 0 to 1. CIk reaches 0 when the all combinations are in conÔ¨Çict, while CIk reaches 1 when no combi- nations are in conÔ¨Çict. We assume that there is negligible discrepancy between the objective and subjective evaluation when the consistency index exceeds some critical value. Then, the satis- faction level functions are approximated as follows:  bS k ¬º vk √∞x1 ; x2 ; .; xnDES √û  (3)  vk  where bS k denotes the approximated value of the satisfaction level for k-th participant. represents response the surface of the satisfaction level function predicted by the RBFN. The critical value of consistency index should be determined in advance. However, there is no guideline to determine the critical value. Therefore, in this study, the critical value is determined by considering the relationship between the consistency index and the validity of the optimum solutions for participants.  2.5.  Calculation of preferred solutions for each participant  The simultaneous evaluation of muscle loads is formulated as a MOOP on the assumption that lower EMG values mean better comfort or usability for consumers. The simultaneous evaluation of muscle loads for the k-th participant is expressed in the following equations:  n  o  f1;k √∞x√û; f2;k √∞x√û; .; fnEMG;k √∞x√û  /min   xi  xU  i  xL  i  √∞I ¬º 1; 2; .; nDES√û  gl √∞x√û  0  √∞l ¬º 1; 2; .; nCON√û  (4)  (5)  (6)  where xi L and xi U represent the lower and upper bounds of the design variables, gk(x) is a constraint, and nCON denotes the num- ber of constraints. In general, no single design variable vector exists that optimizes all objective functions simultaneously, so the objective functions are at least partly in conÔ¨Çict. Hence, the solution of the MOOP is a Pareto optimal set, which is a set of design variable vectors that  
264  T. Chihara, A. Seo / Applied Ergonomics 45 (2014) 261e269  cannot be improved upon for all objective functions simulta- neously, that is, a Pareto optimal set consists of Pareto optimal solutions. In this paper, a satisÔ¨Åcing trade-off method (STOM) (Nakayama and Sawaragi, 1984) is used to select a Pareto optimal solution that is suited to user satisfaction. Fig. 2 shows a conceptual diagram of the STOM. Here, the point minimizing each of the objective functions is called the ideal point fI, and the objective function vector that is satisfactory or desirable to the decision maker is called the aspiration level In addition, the ideal point can be provided by a decision maker. As shown in Fig. 2, the STOM obtains the Pareto optimal solution that is closest to the ideal point from the speciÔ¨Åed aspiration level. The Pareto optimal solution obtained by the STOM is hereafter referred to as the preferred so- lution. The aspiration level should be prescribed when solving the MOOP by means of the STOM. In this study, the objective function vector associated with the aspiration level is that of the optimum solution of the satisfaction level function of the participant. The i;k (i ¬º 1, 2, preferred solution for the k-th participant is denoted by x* j;k (j ¬º 1, 2, ., nEMG) is deÔ¨Åned as ., nDES) and the preferred point f * the objective function values of the preferred solution.  fA.  2.6.  Calculation of compromise solution for all participants  If the preferred solutions for the participants correspond with each other, the preferred solutions may be taken as the compro- mise solution for all participants. Unfortunately, the preferred so- lutions for the participants usually do not entirely correspond with each other. In this study, the compromise solution determined for all participants is based on the concept of compromise (Yu, 1973; Yu and Leitmann, 1974). The regret deÔ¨Åned in Section 1 is expressed as j;k . Then, the design variable vector that minimizes the maximum regret among m participants is deÔ¨Åned as the compro- mise solution xc,m for m participants. Here, the compromise solu- tion is obtained by solving a minemax problem. The optimization problem for calculating the compromise so- lution xc,m for m participants is formulated as follows:  fj;k √∞x√û   f *  2 4  min  max  1jnEMG  1km  n  fj;k √∞x√û   f *  j;k  o3 5  (7)  (8)  (9)   xi  xU  i  xL  i  √∞j ¬º 1; 2; .; nDES√û  gl √∞x√û  0  √∞l ¬º 1; 2; .; nCON√û  Eq.

It is difÔ¨Åcult to solve Eq.

Therefore, the relationship between the amplitude of the maximum regret and the number of divided subgroups of participants is presented to support the decision making of de- signers. The participants are divided into some groups by means of the cluster analysis (Miller and Miller, 2010) of their preferred so- lutions, and then the compromise solutions are obtained for each divided subgroup.  3. Application to the design of handrail positions  3.1. Design of handrail positions  The sit-to-stand (STS) movement is performed throughout the day at the rate of about 3 per hour (Dall and Kerr, 2010). Studies of the STS movement from a chair have been performed by many researchers (Alexander et al., 1991; Arborelius et al., 1992; Burdett et al., 1985; Janssen et al., 2002; Kerr et al., 1991; Rodosky et al., 1989; Schenkman et al., 1996; Su et al., 1998). Providing handrails is one recipe for making the STS movement easy. Several reports on the position of handrails for the STS movement can be found. These reports were mainly based on subjective evaluations by partici- pants (Dekker et al., 2007) or the burden on the lower limbs only (Tanaka et al., 2009). However, the STS movement with handrails should ideally be evaluated on the basis of the comprehensive burden on both the upper and lower limbs. Therefore, the proposed method for simultaneous evaluation of muscle loads is applied to the STS movement, and we consider whether or not the proposed method can provide quantitative information on ergonomic design problems and support the decision making of designers.  3.2. "
s0003687013000793,"  Wide use of hand-held vibrating tools is one of the most important reasons for transmitting vibrations from these tools to the hands, arms and shoulders of the operators. It causes discom- fort to the operator and results in early fatigue. When such fatigue prevails over a period of months and years, they may cause phys- ical, physiological and musculoskeletal disorders (Waersted and Westgaard, 1991; Buckle, 1997; Hagberg, 2002). The ill effects of the prolonged exposure to handearm vibration on the operators have been known for a long time and the occupational health disorders are referred to as ‚Äòvibration-induced white Ô¨Ånger (VWF)‚Äô or ‚Äòhandearm vibration syndrome (HAVS)‚Äô (Taylor and Pelmear, 1975; Hellstrom and Lange Andersen, 1972; GrifÔ¨Ån, 1996). For almost a century, workers operating vibration tools on the job have complained symptoms resembling Raynaud‚Äôs disease. These com- plaints were related to episodic numbness and tingling of the Ô¨Ån- gers, episodic blanching of the Ô¨Ångers, the so-called ‚ÄúVibration- induced White Finger‚Äù (VWF) or HAVS (Palmer et al., 2000; Hubbard et al., 2004; Bylund et al., 2002; Weir and Lander, 2005). Many studies have revealed that the workers were not aware of the  * Corresponding author. Tel.: √æ91 9837111865 (Mob.). jagvirsinghmtr@yahoo.co.in (J.

E-mail addresses:  level of vibration transmitted to hand (Margarita et al., 2008; Hao et al., 2011) whereas in some studies self-reported exposure time estimates were found to be more than actual direct observation estimates (McCallig et al., 2010). The percentage of workers exposed to hand tool vibration is quite high all over the world. Even in advanced countries like Germany, France, Spain and Finland the percentage varies from 4.6 to 10.9 (Eashw, 2008). The prevalence of exposure was found dominated in construction (63% workers), manufacturing and mining (44%) and agriculture and Ô¨Åshing (38%). In construction industry use of vibratory hand tools is of great concern (DiDomenicoa and Nussbaumb, 2008). HandeArm Vibration Syndrome (HAVS) re- mains a signiÔ¨Åcant occupational health problem as disease symp- toms continue to occur even when vibration exposure levels believed to incur low risks. Burstr√∂m et al. (2004) studied metal workers where tools produced low vibratory exposures with frequency-weighted accelerations between 2.1 and 2.5 m/s2 but the prevalence of vascular (39%) and neurological symptoms (47%) still existed, with the vascular incidence rate noticed as 24.2 cases per 1000 exposure years. To have concern about these issues, it is important to know about hand systems response with respect to exposure to vibration. According to biomechanics, the human hand is a very sophisticated and Ô¨Çexible structure. The Biodynamic response distributed on the Ô¨Ångers is very different from that distributed on the palm of the hand (Dong et al., 2005).

240  J. Singh, A .A . Khan / Applied Ergonomics 45 (2014) 239e246  absorption at these two parts of the hand could also generally be very different (Dong et al., 2004). Because the transmitted vibration is likely to be more closely associated with the vibration-induced health effects, it is important to characterize and understand the transmitted vibration. Whereas the vibration transmissibility in the handearm system excited from a single-axis vibration exciter has been studied in controlled laboratory conditions by many re- searchers (e.g., Reynolds and Angevine, 1977; Pyykk√∂ et al., 1976; Gurram et al., 1994; S√∂rensson and Lundstr√∂m, 1992, Marcotte et al., 2005; Dong et al., 2006a,b), the characteristics of vibration transmissibility, especially those under real working conditions, have not been sufÔ¨Åciently investigated. However little information on the vibration transmitted to the handearm system during the operations of drilling machines is available in literature. Although the relationship between such disorders and physical characteristics of vibration (frequency, magnitude and direction) is not yet known completely, it is generally agreed that onset of these disorders can be reduced through a reduction in magnitude of vi- bration transmitted to the hand. It is often recommended that the handle surface should be smooth and slightly compressible (Konz 1990; Mital and Kilbom, 1992b). The arguments for this recom- mendation are that it is easier on the hand, it distributes the surface pressure more evenly in the hand and also that it is vibration attenuating, compared with an incompressible material. Apart from this vibrations transmitted to hand arm caused by power tools also vary for different postures of hand (Joshi et al., 2012). When studying handle design it is of great importance to have reliable and relevant information regarding all aspects of the handle. Handle is main part of the power tools through which vibrations are trans- mitted in human body. Hence to reduce risk factors associated with hand arm vibration, it is necessary to improve the handle design so that vibration transmitted could be reduced. Reducing the magni- tude of the vibration transmitted from a tool to the hand has been viewed as a potential effective approach to prevent handearm vi- bration syndrome (GrifÔ¨Ån, 1990; Pelmear and Wasserman, 1998; Cherng et al., 2009; Morioka and GrifÔ¨Ån, 2009; Mallick, 2010). There are two simple ways of reducing vibrations transmitted from power tools to the hands. One is to use gloves and second one is to use coating on the handles through which vibrations are trans- mitted to hands. The use of gloves has been demonstrated to have both positive and negative inÔ¨Çuences on hand exertion. Wearing gloves reduces hand movement and dexterity, and hence increases the perfor- mance time needed to complete the task (Plummer et al., 1985; Bellingar and Slocum, 1993; Bensel, 1993; Muralidhar and Bishu, 1994). Some studies reported that wearing gloves reduces the grip force as compared with the barehanded condition (Sudhakar et al., 1988; Wang, 1991; Hallbeck and McMullin, 1993; Shih et al., 1995). Furthermore, the vibration energy transmitted to and absorbed by the handearm system results in relative compression and extension of tissues (Reynolds, 1977). The results of gloves inÔ¨Çuencing the hand-transmitted vibration reported in published reports are varied. When operating a pneumatic chipping hammer, Goel and Rim (1987) indicated that the use of leather, Porton padded and Sorbothane padded gloves, all reduce hand-trans- mitted vibration as compared with the barehanded condition. On the other hand, the report of Gurram et al. (1994) revealed that the gloves do not yield an effective attenuation of hand-transmitted vibration caused by hand-held powered tools. Most of commer- cially available antivibration gloves did not attenuate vibrations below 100 Hz (Sampson and Van Niekerk, 2003) and only reduce high frequency vibrations (Smutz et al., 2002). In case of gloves vibration perception at different location on the hand arm system could vary (Dong et al., 2010a,b) indicating effectiveness of anti- vibration gloves to be location oriented.  Another important approach is coating using damping materials on tool handle that can be used for preventing or reducing the amount of vibration transmitted to hand from the power tools. Some of the problems associated with gloves may be eliminated by using coating on the handle. But the materials which are used to reduce vibrations are of very high cost. In countries like India contractors are not ready to use expensive tools. Therefore task is really challenging in developing and underdeveloped countries to Ô¨Ånd cheaper ways to reduce problems due to hand-transmitted vibrations. Hence it is important to develop coatings which are relatively cheap so that these can be used in developing and un- derdeveloped countries to overcome the workers problems as in these countries even the laws are not so strict regarding compen- sation and other facilities for workers. In the present study different coatings were used on the handle and their effect on the vibration transmitted at the hand and wrist was investigated.  2. Method  2.1. Approach  Vibrations are transmitted from power tools to the hands of operators. The transfer of vibrations from machine to operators can be reduced either by wearing gloves or by providing coating on the surface of handle. Coating of handle is preferable over wearing gloves as these are integrated with machine itself and overcome many problems associated with gloves. Isolation of vibration was done in this experiment by coating the handle with some of very common materials easily available at a very less cost. Hence this experiment was to investigate the effect of different coating ma- terials on the amount of vibration transmitted to the hand of operators.  2.2.  Participants  Five male participants (Right handed college students) vol- unteered to participate in this experiment. All were healthy with no history of neuromuscular or vascular disorders. The subjects showed their interest to voluntarily participate in the study. Their consent was taken prior to start of the experiment. The mean age, mean height and mean mass of the subjects were found to be 23.5 years, 167.69 cm, and 64.8 kg respectively.  2.3.  Coating material  Five wooden handles were prepared in the carpentry shop of the college. The reason for choosing wood as material for making handle was its ease of manufacturing, good strength and capability of damping vibrations transmitted through it. Moreover it was possible to attach and remove the handles as per the requirement of experiments performed. One handle was kept bare whereas other four were coated with different materials commonly avail- able as shown in Table 1. Major properties considered for selecting material were vibration damping, comfortable in holding, long life, cheap and easy availability.

Khan / Applied Ergonomics 45 (2014) 239e246  241  These materials were coated in such a manner that the Ô¨Ånal diameter after coating was 45 mm for all the coated handles as shown in Fig. 1. Uncoated handle was also of same diameter. The handles were having a coating layer of 3 mm. From a pilot experiment done on different type of coating materials; it was found that all selected materials used for coating in the present study were supposed to reduce the level of vibrations transmitted to hands. H2 handle which was coated with sponge and velvet was softer in holding too.  2.4. Measurement of vibration  The hand arm vibration measurement procedure was followed as described in ISO5349 (2001). The vibration levels were recorded using the LABVIEW code written in Version 8.6 to record in each of the directions (X, Y, and Z). The sampling rate was 1024 per second. That was made possible due to the interfacing of the triaxial trans- ducer (Model: SEN04/F-CBL, Make: PCB Piezotronics Ltd.) through NI USB-9234 card to HP laptop (Core 2 duo Processor based). The ISO standard describes four ways to Ô¨Åx accelerometers to tool handle. These are screwing, gluing, using hose clip connectors and using hand tool adapters. Hand tool adapter was used in present study to measure vibration at tool handle. The weight of the accelerometer signiÔ¨Åcantly affects the magnitude of vibration at the handearm system (Gurram et al., 1994). NIOSH (1989) has recommended the weight of the accelerometer to be less than 5 g and the total weight of the accelerometer and adapter to be less than 20 g to reduce measurement errors and to increase accuracy. A lightweight mini- ature accelerometer was used in the present study for measurement of vibration transmissibility. For measuring vibration at wrist the accelerometer was attached to the wrist by a light weighted strip wrapped over wrist and accelerometer as shown in Fig. 2. The details of the connections and recording for a participant are shown in Fig. 2. The coordinate axes for vibration recordings were inline with the guidelines of ISO5349-1086.  2.5.  Experimental design  The task of drilling in a cast iron block was chosen to study the vibration passed to the operators from the hand-held drilling ma- chine. As the vibrations are transmitted from drilling machine through handle, Ô¨Åve handles were considered. Four handles of which were having different types of coating and one handle was without any type of coating. The feed force (push force) was kept constant at 60  5 N during the experiment as variation of feed force would have altered the amount of vibration transmitted to handle of  Fig. 1.

Experimental participant.  setup  showing  vibration measurement  at  the wrist  of  the  operator because transmissibility is signiÔ¨Åcantly dependent on grip force (Gurram et al., 1994). Different handles were considered as independent parameter and measurement of vibration at two po- sitions were considered as dependent parameter. Fixing of handle on drilling machine as well as participants performing drilling operation was randomized to avoid ordering effect. For each participant 10 recording of vibrations (5 different handles  two positions) were made for duration of 30 s in each case.  2.6.  Procedure  The subject sat on the stool as shown in Fig. 2. The stool was having an arrangement to lower or raise it through screw. Hence height of the stool could be lowered or raised as per the require- ment of the experimenter so that posture for the arm of the par- ticipants did not change with participants. The upper arm was kept vertical without abduction, forearm horizontal with elbow Ô¨Çexed at 90 throughout the session. The participants were asked to drill the feed force of 60 N (5 N). The rig was prepared in the college hole in an iron block Ô¨Åxed in the experimental rig with constant workshop and it had a provision of Ô¨Åxing the work piece in it along with a mechanism to measure the feed force applied on the work piece through a spring balance. As it was not possible to maintain exactly 60 N feed force by every participant a variation of 5 N in either side was considered acceptable to take into account human errors and other variations. As soon as the feed force varied the given range there was a provision to inform the participant, moreover he could also see the level of feed force applied through the pointer marked on helical spring. Prior to start of the experi- ment the participant was asked to have a trial of drilling with required feed force so that he became accustomed to the task. One of the Ô¨Åve fabricated handles was screwed to the drill machine and the participants were asked to drill in random order for 40 s in each case. Measurement of vibration started after 5 s of the beginning of drilling task. Vibrations were measured for 30 s in each case. Vi- brations were measured at surface of handle and at the wrist of the participant for each type of handle using a triaxial accelerometer. For measuring vibrations at the surface of handle, an adapter was used over which accelerometer was fastened. This adapter was held in between surface of handle and middle Ô¨Ånger where vibrations were measured. Vibrations at wrist were measured by keeping the accelerometer at wrist and fastening it over wrist through a strap wrapped over it as shown in Fig. 2 (as per ISO5349-2).

Sample graph between rms value and number of  frames.  3. Results  The vibrations at the surface of the handles and the wrist of operators were recorded for different conditions along X, Y and Z directions. The vibrations were recorded at a sample rate of 1024 per second. Frames were decided by selecting 256 sample readings and clubbing them in one frame and thus 120 frames were made in data recorded for 30 s. Sample graph between one sided power spectral density and frequency, frequency of occurrence and vi- bration amplitude, Root mean square (rms) value and number of frames, amplitude and time are shown in Figs. 3e6. The data were recorded at a rate of 1024 samples per second. From these data equivalent vibrations were calculated. The recor- ded data were analyzed further.  3.1.  Equivalent vibration levels at surface of handle  Values of equivalent rms vibrations for different handles along with the transmissibility of coating materials are summarized in Table 2. Vibration transmissibility was found to be least in H4 handle, coating of which was made of rubber sheets with Rexene covering. It was found that all the coating materials were able to reduce vibrations. A box plot of vibrations recorded at the surface of different handles is shown in Fig. 7. It was observed from recorded vibrations that the magnitude of vibration on the surface of handle was maximum when bare handle was used. As the coating was provided on the handle the vibration level reduced considerably due to isolation of vibrations. It is  evident from Fig. 7 that maximum vibrations are reduced by coating of handle H4 (coated with rubber sheet and Rexene) fol- lowed by handle H5. Equivalent vibrations transmitted through coating of handles H2 and H3 were of almost same magnitude and these two coated handles were able to reduce least vibration transmitted.  3.2.  Equivalent vibration levels at wrist  Vibrations are transmitted to arm from hand. Some of the vi- brations are absorbed by hand which was evident from the rms value of vibrations recorded at wrist. In each case vibrations reaching at wrist were signiÔ¨Åcantly less than the vibrations measured at the surface of the handle. A box plot of rms value of vibrations recorded at the wrist of participants is shown in Fig. 8. From the box plot of vibrations measured at the wrist for different type of handles it was found that least rms vibrations were recorded at the wrist when handles H4 and H5 were used. In case of bare handle maximum vibrations were observed. Vibrations recorded at wrist were found to be less with handle H3 as compared to handle H2.  3.3.  Comparison of vibration at surface of handle and wrist  A comparative value of vibrations recorded at surface of handle and the wrist of operators was shown in Fig. 9. The magnitude of vibrations recorded at the surface of bare handle (uncoated handle) was maximum and at surface of handle H4 its value was found minimum. It was evident from the graph (Fig. 9) that vibrations were maximum at the wrist when bare handle was used. Vibrations  Fig. 4. Sample graph between frequency of occurrence and vibration amplitude.

Vibration transmissibility of hand was calculated by Ô¨Ånding the ratio of rms equivalent vibrations at the wrist of participants and surface of the handle. The values of vi- bration transmissibility of hand were found to be 0.354, 0.571, 0.408, 0.4326, and 0.3555 for handles H1, H2, H3, H4 and H5 respectively. Although the transmissibility of vibrations for each case should be same because same participants were involved in each case but the difference was observed which might be due to different coupling forces used by participants while using different handles. More over wrist might not be straight all the time of experimentation. These results indicate that about 60e65% vibra- tions are absorbed by human hand. If the amount of vibration is more at the surface of handle more vibrations are absorbed by human beings using vibrating tools.  3.4. Equivalent vibration levels and power density at surface of handle in Z direction  As Z direction was dominant hence it was selected for detailed study as per ISO5349-1 for hand-transmitted vibrations. Data ob- tained for vibration transmitted and power density at the surface of handle in Z direction for various type of handles are presented in Table 3. It was observed that the vibration transmitted at the surface of handle was maximum in H1 handle whereas the vibrations trans- mitted at the surface of H5 handle were minimum, in Z direction. Results of ANOVA for vibration transmitted in Z direction for different handles are presented in Table 4. These results showed that the vibration transmitted in direction are signiÔ¨Åcantly different for different type of handle coatings as p < 0.001.  Z  Fig. 8. Equivalent rms vibrations recorded at wrist of participants for different handle coatings.  A graph for vibrations transmitted in Z direction with 95% conÔ¨Ådence interval was plotted for different coatings of handle (Fig. 10). These rms value of vibrations recorded at the surface of handle for different coatings were found to be signiÔ¨Åcantly different (p < 0.001). When bare handle was used maximum vi- brations were recorded at the surface but the level of vibrations reduced signiÔ¨Åcantly by applying various types of coatings at the surface of handle. All the coatings reduced vibrations considerably. On the basis of vibration transmitted at the surface of coated handles it could be concluded that coating of H5 handle isolated maximum vibrations followed by H4, H3 and H2 handles.  3.5.  Equivalent vibration levels at wrist (Z direction only)  The vibrations recorded at wrist along Z direction are summa- rized in Table 5. The results indicated that maximum vibrations were recorded in case of H1 (bare handle) whereas minimum vi- brations were found in H5 handle. ANOVA results shown in Table 6 indicated that handle coatings signiÔ¨Åcantly affected the vibrations at wrist along Z direction. Vibrations were reduced considerably as compared to vibration at surface of handle, indicating absorption of vibration by hand of operators in this direction. Fig. 11 shows the bar graph of vibrations in Z direction with 95% conÔ¨Ådence interval for different handles.  4.

Rubber was also found suitable in reducing vibrations in power tillers out of various interventions of different materials used in the study (Chaturvedi et al., 2012). Handles H2 and H3 showed almost similar magnitude of vibration transmitted indi- cating that both type of coating produced almost similar results, when rms value of vibration transmitted was considered. Handle H2 was coated with sponge and velvet whereas handle H3 was coated with jute and cotton. H4 handle which absorbed maximum vibration was having a covering of rubber sheets and Rexene. Some of the researchers have recommended that the handle surface should be smooth and slightly compressible (Konz, 1990; Mital and Kilbom, 1992b). The arguments for this recommendation are that it is easier on the hand, it distributes the surface pressure more evenly in the hand and also that it is vibration attenuating, compared with an incompressible material. The more even pres- sure distribution was documented (Fellows and Freivalds, 1991). However, compressible/resilient materials on the handle have not been shown to signiÔ¨Åcantly reduce vibrations (Radwin and Haney, 1996). In the present study vibration transmitted along Z direction was analyzed separately in detail due to the reason that Z direction was dominant direction. Due to this reason some of researchers have studied vibration transmitted in this dominant direction (Marcotte et al., 2005; Aldien et al., 2006; Dong et al., 2006a,b). The magni- tude of rms vibration was found maximum in Z direction followed by X direction. In case of Y direction the value of rms vibration was found least. The results of the study also veliditated that the vi- bration transmitted through the coating were signiÔ¨Åcantly affected in this direction, whereas vibrations transmitted along Y direction were not signiÔ¨Åcantly different for different coated handles. It might be due to the reason that grip force was provided in a di- rection which was perpendicular to the direction of vibration measured. The feed force applied was also not in Y direction, hence there was no signiÔ¨Åcant effect in vibration transmitted in this di- rection. Although measurement of vibration was done using ISO5349-2 standard but recordings may be highly depending on many other factors including the operators‚Äô technique, the condi- tion of work equipment, the material being processed and the measurement methods. However the parameters affecting the magnitude of vibrations were controlled in present study but par- ticipants were college students who did not have expertise in using  Fig. 10. Vibration transmitted in Z direction at surface of handles (with 95% conÔ¨Ådence interval) for different handle types as taken in present study.  hand drill machines. Moreover students of same age group are likely to provide different results as compared to true working population. Also with time the drill bit used lost its sharpness which might have inÔ¨Çuenced the level of vibrations. Theoretically isolation behaviour of coatings should also be inÔ¨Çuenced by the biodynamic properties of hand arm system apart from the coating material used. Human anthropometrics inÔ¨Çuences the biodynamic properties of hand arm system (Burstrom, 1997) and it would be easy to use hand and arm sizes as measure to assess individual effect. However, it is not necessary that biodynamic properties of hand only depends on anthropometric measure because tissues and bones in the system, coupling condition of hand tool, location as well as orientation are important. The equivalent vibrations transmitted to hand were least in handle H4 followed by handle H5, but the value of vibrations recorded at the wrist was found least in case of handle H5 followed by handle H4.This might be due to individual factors of the par- ticipants. As individual factors are very important in vibration transmitted through hand, the nature of results of vibration transmitted through hand were found to be different at wrist along Z direction, as compared to vibration transmitted through coating and measured at the surface of handle. It was observed that magnitude of vibration reduced by coating in handle H5 was maximum in Z direction. The magnitude of vibrations was so less that vibrations were not further reduced at wrist. It indicated that least vibrations were absorbed by hand of operator in this direction. Probably it is due to the reason that if fewer vibrations are reaching at surface of hand vibrations absorbed by hand also decreased. Other factors like hand size, contact forces and stiffness are also important. A person with large hand size will likely have a thicker layer of soft palm tissues than would a person with small hand. Vibrations are inÔ¨Çuenced by stiffness of palm contact. The value of stiffness of a large hand under similar effective palm force may be lower than that exhibited by a smaller hand.

The biodynamic response distribution on Ô¨Ångers is very different from that of the palm of the hand (Dong et al., 2005). Therefore the amount of energy transmitted and absorbed at these parts of the hand could also be different (Dong et al., 2004). Handles used in the present study were all wooden having coating of different materials over them. Although in most of the drill machines the handle used are made up of either metal or polymers. Coating applied over wooden handle may probably show difference in behaviour if applied over metallic or plastic handles. Application of wood in handles may itself reduce vibra- tion level at surface of handle due to damping properties of wood. However the nature of level of vibrations reduced by coating, over different kind of materials should not alter as the properties of coating will not change, whatsoever material is used in handles. In the present study variability of vibration transmissibility was also not found to be individual speciÔ¨Åc. Contradictory to this several studies (Paddan and GrifÔ¨Ån, 1997; O‚ÄôBoyle, 2001; Hewitt, 2002) had reported that there were large variations in the glove vibra- tion transmissibility data obtained from different subjects sug- gesting that the effectiveness of gloves was also individual speciÔ¨Åc. The inter-subject variability of glove transmissibility may cause some difÔ¨Åculties when evaluating the performance of gloves using the ISO standardized test method. A glove may be classiÔ¨Åed as a true ‚Äúantivibration glove‚Äù when tested with some subjects, but not with other subjects (Paddan and GrifÔ¨Ån, 2001). However results of present experiment showed that each type of coatings was capable of reducing vibration for all participants, although level of vibration absorbed varied with participants. There might be a difference in individuals absorbing ability but that differences found in the present results were not very different for individuals participated in this experiment.  Fig. 11. Graph showing variation of vibration transmitted in Z direction at wrist of operators (with 95% conÔ¨Ådence interval) for different handle types.  Coating on handles of a hand-held vibrating tool is an effective way of reducing vibrations. Out of the four different coatings studied, handle coated with rubber sheets and Rexene absorbed maximum vibrations and transmitted least vibrations at hand. This coating was able to reduce rms value of vibrations by 59%. Vibra- tions transmitted in dominant direction (Z direction) were signiÔ¨Å- cantly different for various coatings used but these were not signiÔ¨Åcantly different in Y direction. Vibrations absorbed by hand were maximum in case of bare handle (handle without coating). Vibrations transmitted from surface of handle to wrist of operators were found to be 35% in two cases; 40, 43 and 57% in other three cases indicating that almost 60% vibrations were absorbed by Ô¨Ån- gers and palm of the operators. In present study the vibrations transmitted at wrist were considered without considering the in- dividual effect of Ô¨Ångers and palm. This effect could be considered in further studies.

s000368701300080x,"  Convex mirrors are used to reduce blind spots and to increase the Ô¨Åeld of view in many situations. Some of them are used for crime prevention in automated teller machines or stores, allowing the users to see what is happening behind them or in their blind spots. Others are used to conÔ¨Årm safe trafÔ¨Åc conditions at in- tersections or on the vehicles (Moukhwas, 1987). In automobiles, convex type mirrors are often use and designed as rear-view mir- rors to conÔ¨Årm the safety of rear or side blind areas without requiring the occupant to change his/her head position (Case et al., 1980). Rear-view mirrors can be grouped into outer rear-view mirrors and inner rear-view mirrors. Outer rear-view mirrors, which are also called wing mirrors or side-view mirrors, include fender mirrors and door mirrors. The UNECE (United Nations Eco- nomic Commission for Europe) Transport Division has been providing secretariat services to the World Forum for Harmoniza- tion of Vehicle Regulations (WP 29) for more than 50 years. In this forum, the global uniformity of wheeled vehicle equipment or parts has also been discussed. However, the rear-view mirrors are currently different in each country and for each manufacturer,  * Corresponding author. Tel.: √æ81 93 691 7261; fax: √æ81 93 603 3657.

The advantages of using convex mirrors in driving are an increased Ô¨Åeld of view and the reduction of blind spots. However, the image size is smaller than that seen in a plane mirror in the same location. Then, when overtaking other automobiles, drivers may overestimate their dis- tance from a following car and make dangerous decisions. There- fore, in some countries (United States, Canada, India, Korea and so on), these mirrors need to be labeled with the safety warning ‚ÄúObjects in mirror are closer than they appear‚Äù, to warn the driver of the convex mirror‚Äôs distorting effects on distance perception. In addition to above features of convex mirrors, we cannot see objects clearly, and perceive blurred vision when we observe them carefully through a convex mirror. We supposed that this blurred vision derives from the temporary disorder of ocular accommoda- tion that occurs when looking in a convex mirror. There have so far been a few reports written about the optical speciÔ¨Åcity of the convex mirror (e.g., Hahnel and Hecht, 2012; Higashiyama et al., 2001; Higashiyama and Shimono, 2004; Smith and Atchinson, 1997; van der Horst, 2004). All of these reports were written about the relation between human perceptions of the distance from the mirror to the object and the parameters such as mirror curva- ture. However, no study has yet reported objective evaluations of viewing through convex mirrors. The present study investigated the effects of a convex mirror on human ocular accommodative systems using an infrared optometer.  0003-6870/$ e see front matter √ì 2013 Elsevier Ltd and The Ergonomics Society.

s0003687013000811,"  In today‚Äôs consumer society the availability and affordability of luxury products grows worldwide (de Looze et al., 2003; Yeoman and McMahon-Beattie, 2006). For this reason, ergonomics and comfort design get more attention from industrial designers because designing ergonomically optimized products leads to popular products as seen by Apple‚Äôs iPhone (Walker et al., 2009). In sales promotion ergonomic design is a growing factor and contentment and comfort is a frequently used phrase. The same development can be noted in the automotive industry (Kolich and Taboun, 2004; Franz et al., 2011). To be ahead of competition in the automotive industry, ergonomics and seating comfort need to be more focused on the car interior designing process (Zenk et al., 2009, 2012). The main reasons are the suburbanization of the cit- ies, the increase of trafÔ¨Åc jams, growing business and leisure travel. As such, people are spending more time in their cars (Hasselbacher and Schwaighofer, 2001; Frank et al., 2004; Lyons and Urry, 2005; Zenk et al., 2009). To avoid discomfort and fatigue it is necessary to  * Corresponding author. Tel.: √æ49 176 601 44579. E-mail addresses: susanne.s.schmidt@bmw.de, susanne.schmidt@tum.de (S.

To analyze seating posture and components needed for driving (e.g. steering wheel, pedals, gear selection lever, navigation systems or displays) manufacturers use 2D and 3D tools, especially CAD and digital human models (DHM). Most of DHM can be used to inves- tigate vision, comfort, reachability, clearance and the driving posture in general. Although there are lots of studies, theoretical and laboratory/Ô¨Åeldtests (e.g. Hosea et al., 1986; Harrison et al., 2000; Oudenhuijzen et al., 2004), customers often complain of postural discomfort especially in the neck and shoulders, as well as of low back pain, which is an increasing disease in modern society (Magnusson and Pope, 1998; Andersson, 1999; Ebe and GrifÔ¨Ån, 2001). In order to achieve correct ergonomic design and comfort it is necessary to work with joint angles in DHM which have to be deduced from scientiÔ¨Åc studies in literature. On this topic Kyung and Nussbaum (2009) related to Reed et al. (2002), Hanson et al. (2006) and ChafÔ¨Ån (2007) claimed that: ‚ÄúWith expanding use of digital human models (DHMs) for proactive as well as retrospective ergonomic analysis of automotive interior design, there is a concomitant need for accurately predicting and specifying driving posture‚Äù (p. 939).

Research on the driver‚Äôs workspace during car designing processes, and on optimum sitting posture with a focus on joint angles is mostly done with values of subjective comfort (e.g. Hanson et al., 2006), while studies using biomechanical methods like Andersson et al. (1974), Zenk (2009), Franz (2010) or Hosea et al. (1986) are rarely found. In addition, published material shows a large variance concerning optimum and comfort joint angles. Because of these differences described in literature it is necessary to decide on one source as discussed by Vogt et al. (2005). The main aim of this work is to show which recommendations exist on optimum and preferred sitting posture and scientiÔ¨Åc evidence. Nowadays, factors like human strength do not play an important role in cars anymore. Therefore, it is questionable whether opti- mum driving posture should be deÔ¨Åned on objective or on sub- jective comfort and discomfort values. Articles found in literature with available joint angles were discussed and compared in order to obtain a general overview. It was no matter whether the sitting angles were deÔ¨Åned based on studies with biomechanical or physiological facts, or on the sub- jective preferred posture. Moreover, quite often a mixture of the expressions optimum and preferred joint angle is found in literature. Therefore we created a clear predeÔ¨Ånition for these two expressions which we followed throughout the paper to make it easier for the reader. In order to make clear statements we deÔ¨Åned ‚Äòoptimum joint angles‚Äô and ‚Äòoptimum joint posture‚Äô to be dependent on biome- chanical and physiological factors that, for example, lead to less muscular fatigue which in turn results in greater safety. ‚ÄôPreferred joint angles‚Äô as well as ‚Äôcomfortable joint angles‚Äô are indicated by subjective impressions and deÔ¨Åned by the drivers‚Äô preferences. However the preferred posture is only one part which in- Ô¨Çuences the comfort and discomfort of the driver (Kyung et al., 2008). In general there is a need for additional research for the opti- mization of DHM with biomechanical methods. Precise joint angles for comfortable driving positions will improve ergonomic design when these factors are implemented in digital human models (Kyung and Nussbaum, 2009). Therefore, this study focused on the investigation of similarities and discrepancies in methods, results and recommendations of scientiÔ¨Åc papers dealing with optimum and preferred joint angles in automotive sitting posture.  2.

s0003687013000823,"  During the period of 1999e2004, the retail trade sector had more than 70,000 Workers Compensation musculoskeletal dis- order (MSD) claims in the state of Ohio, which accounted for about 12.5% of all claims and more than $350 billion in medical and indemnity costs (Dunning et al., 2010). The top three body regions suffering a MSD were low back (29.2%), hand/wrist (20.1%), and knee (15.1%) (Dunning et al., 2010). In 2000, ac- cording to Bureau of Labor & Statistics, there were more than 20,000 musculoskeletal disorders in grocery stores in the United States (Bureau of Labor and Statistics, 2000). More than 50% of these MSDs were linked to lifting of material in the stores (Bureau of Labor and Statistics, 2000). The injury and illness rate for retail in Puerto Rico is 3.5 per 100 full-time workers and more specif- ically 5.5 per 100 FT workers for grocery store workers (Bureau of Labor and Statistics, 2000). Thus, the retail and trade in- dustry, speciÔ¨Åcally grocery stores workers, suffer from signiÔ¨Åcant  * Corresponding author.

One research group reported signiÔ¨Åcant loading on the spine when lifting boxes during palletizing and depalletizing of boxes, in a simulated warehouse order selector task (Marras et al., 1999a,b; Davis et al., 1998). Lifting from lower heights also was found to be more detrimental indicating the importance of lifting at mid-thigh height or above (Marras et al., 1999a,b). The bottom line is that item selectors in grocery stores handle a plethora of products while stocking shelves in the stores. In general, the stocking of shelves in- cludes the loading of a cart with product from the temporary ware- house, transferring the cart, and unloading product onto the shelves in the store. Traditional carts have a bed that is low to the ground (less than 20 cm high) so that the product can be stacked. However, the low cart requires the stocker to bend forward signiÔ¨Åcantly to place the product similar to the lower layers of a pallet, which has been shown to have the highest loads on the spine (Marras et al., 1997). One potential intervention that may have utility for the stocking of product in grocery stores is an adjustable height cart where the cart platform height starts at mid-thigh height and lowers as product is added to allow the height of the product to remain at or slightly below waist height. In order to be an effective inter- vention, the cart would need to reduce the awkward postures that  0003-6870/$ e see front matter √ì 2013 Elsevier Ltd and The Ergonomics Society.

Thus, the objective of the study was to determine the effectiveness and feasibility of an adjustable cart as a potential intervention for the handling of products in a grocery store setting. SpeciÔ¨Åcally, the project quantiÔ¨Åed the kinematic re- sponses and ergonomic risk indicators (LBD risk and NIOSH lifting index) for stock handlers in a grocery store in Puerto Rico when utilizing two carts: 1) traditional low Ô¨Çat bed and 2) an adjustable height cart that allows product to remain at mid-thigh level or higher at the origin of the lift.

The average age was 31.0 years old (std. dev. ¬º 7.7 yrs) with a wide range of expe- riences as a stocker: Ô¨Åve of the participants had less than 1 year of experience while the remaining 10 had more than 3 years. The body body weight of 90.6 kg (std. dev. ¬º 17.8 kg) and height of 173 cm dimensions of the 15 workers were typical in size with an average (std. dev. ¬º 6.8 cm).  2.3.  Experimental design  2. Material and methods  2.1.  Study overview  The current study attempted to determine the effectiveness of an adjustable cart (referred to hereafter as Adjustable Ergo Cart) in reducing the awkward postures and trunk motions commonly found when loading and unloading a traditional low bed cart in grocery stores. Workers in a regional grocery store in Puerto Rico were observed while conducting common stocking tasks including loading and unloading of a cart. Two types of carts were investi- gated: 1) traditional cartdstandard non-adjustable base and 2) Adjustable Ergo Cartdadjustable base that had variable height (e.g. product lowered as more items were placed on the cart). The study design was a sample of convenience with respect to experimental conditions since products were selected based on items available in the store stock warehouse. Quantitative and qualitative measures were recorded when workers completed the stocking tasks with both carts. Questionnaires were administered in Spanish, which were translated by the research team prior to the study being conducted from English versions in literature.  2.2.  Study participants  Fifteen workers in a regional grocery store in Puerto Rico were recruited. All of the participants were males and worked as either Shelf stockers for the store (n ¬º 11), Product handler in warehouse  The study design was a two-factor design that took place in the Ô¨Åeld at the grocery store in Puerto Rico. The evaluations were completed in the warehouse section of the store that simulated the stocking activities of loading product on the cart and unloading product to the shelves. Given that data collection took place during store hours, it was not feasible to collect the data on the store Ô¨Çoor due to worries about customer shopping interference. The inde- pendent variables were task condition (e.g. food product transferred) and type of intervention (e.g. Traditional vs. Adjustable Ergo Cart). The included: 1) three-dimensional trunk posture and velocity, 2) probability of high risk group membership from the LMM model, commonly referred to as the LMM LBD risk index, 3) horizontal moment arm and static load moment, 4) sub- jective ratings of exertion, ease of use, and productivity, 5) time to complete task, and 6) NIOSH cumulative lifting index (CLI).

Type of  intervention  Two types of carts were investigated in the current study: 1) traditional cart and 2) Adjustable Ergo Cart (intervention) cart. The traditional cart was a four-wheel (all rotating) cart with a Ô¨Åxed base that was 17.8 cm high. The dimensions of the base were 127.0 cm long by 45.7 cm wide. The cart had two ends that were Ô¨Åxed to the base (See Fig. 1). The traditional cart was the primary cart utilized  Fig. 1.

K.G. Davis, L. Orta An√©s / Applied Ergonomics 45 (2014) 285e292  287  for stocking at the grocery store selected. The Adjustable Ergo Cart had a platform that adjusted to the weight of the product placed on top of the cart (Fig. 1). The adjustable base could be tuned to respond to weights between 50 kg and 150 kg. The cart used a spring mechanism to counteract the weight placed on the cart platform. The platform dimensions were 71.1 cm long by 45.0 cm wide with an adjustable range between 27.4 cm and 66.3 cm from the ground. A single handle at the height of 91.4 cm allowed easy maneuverability. The cart had four caster wheels with two Ô¨Åxed and two rotating.  2.4.2.  Task condition  There were four different task conditions evaluated in the warehouse of the grocery store: 1) loading cart with 2-L bottles of soda pop, 2) loading cart with bags of dog food, 3) loading cart with 12-can boxes of soup, and 3) unloading cart of 12-cans packages of soda pop. The task conditions were selected to represent the full diversity of items that stockers commonly handle as well as loading and unloading of the cart. However, the selection of the items transferred was partially a sample of convenience as items were selected based on what was present in the warehouse at the time of data collection.  2.4.2.1.  Loading cart with 2-L bottles of soda pop. For each cart, the  participants lifted six packages of 2-L bottles of soda pop. Each package contained four bottles that were plastic wrapped together with an opening on both sides that served as a handle. The six in- dividual packs of bottles were stacked on a pallet (4 packages on the bottom row, 2 packages on the top row) and transferred to the carts (See Fig. 1A). The height of the bottles for the bottom row on the pallet was 68.6 cm while the 2nd row bottles were at a height of 106.7 cm. For the traditional cart, the packages of 2-L were stacked with 5 on the bottom row and 1 on the top. For the Adjustable Ergo Cart, the packages were stacked with 3 on top and 3 on bottom. The selection of the pattern was individually selected as no instructions were provided. All of the stockers used these patterns. The stacking was based on how the selectors used the different carts. Each package of four bottles of soda pop weighted 7.4 kg for a total of 44.3 kg.  2.4.2.2.  Loading cart with boxes of 12-soup cans. The participants  lifted 12 boxes of soup cans from storage shelf to the each of the carts, performed in random order. The boxes contained twelve 0.3 kg cans that were shrink-wrapped with plastic (4 rows of 3 cans). Each box weighed 3.58 kg. The boxes of cans were stacked in two columns of 9 boxes where the entire right column and the top three boxes of the left column were lifted to the carts (total of 12 boxes of soup). The typical pattern that the majority of the stockers utilized was lift two boxes at a time for four lifts followed by the lifting of one box from the left stack and then lift two boxes fol- lowed by one box from the right column. The height of the boxes on the shelf started at 20.4 cm and increased 10.2 cm per box to a height of 111.8 cm. The heights for the two box lifts were at the bottom of the top box while the heights for single lifts were in the middle of the box, corresponding to the center of the weight. Thus, in total, seven lifts were usually completed. Twelve of the selectors utilized the typical lift pattern while three lifted single boxes of cans for each lift. The typical pattern of stacking on the traditional cart depended upon the stocker with all the two box lifts being placed on the bottom of the cart and the remaining four lifts being placed on the top of previous boxes of cans. The other dominant placement pattern was two columns. The pattern was four columns of boxes of cans. Again, since we wanted the stockers to complete the lifting of soup cans realistically, no directions on how to unload or load with respect to placement or number of boxes were pro- vided. See Fig. 1B for placement of cans on the two carts.  2.4.2.3.  Loading cart with bags of dog food. The selection of 6 bags  of dog food represented a large item where stockers lifted the bags from a pallet, carried bags approximately 4.5 m, and placed them on the carts. The bags were stacked on the pallet in a single column starting at a height of 53.3 cm, increasing 10.2 cm for each subse- quent bag. Each bag of dog food weighted 6.8 kg. For the traditional cart, two types of patterns were used: 1) single column and 2) two columns. The single stack had all six bags stacked in order on top of each other. For the two-column placement, the typical pattern adapted by the stockers was to place the 1st bag on the left side on cart followed by the next on the right side. The stockers would then stack the next bags on top in the same pattern, resulting in 2- columns of three bags. For the Adjustable Ergo Cart, the bags were stacked in single column for all stockers. Fig. 1C provides a view of the two types of stacking in single columns.  2.4.2.4. Unloading cans of soda pop from cart to shelf. Twelve boxes  of 12 soda pop cans were stacked in two columns on each of the carts. The cans of soda were lifted in pairs of 12-packs from the cart and then placed on the shelf in two columns. In all, six lifts were utilized to transfer the cans of soda from the cart to the shelf. The height for each of the 6 sets of two boxes was 30.5 cm, 30.5 cm, 53.3 cm, 53.3 cm, 76.2 cm and 76.2 cm, respectively. Refer to Fig. 1D for the typical lifting pattern for both carts. One 12-packs of soda weighed 6.05 kg.  2.5. Dependent variable  2.5.1.  Trunk posture and velocity  The lumbar motion monitor (LMM) measured the instantaneous three-dimensional trunk kinematics (position and velocity) during the grocery stocking tasks. The LMM is a tri-axial electrogoniometric system that is essentially an exoskeleton of the spine, which mea- sures the instantaneous position, velocity, and acceleration of the spine in the sagittal (forward Ô¨Çexion), lateral (side Ô¨Çexion), and twist planes of motion. The LMM was mounted on the participant‚Äôs back using a shoulder harness and waist belt. LMM data were transmitted via telemetry to a laptop computer where they were recorded for post processing. Further information about the design and accuracy of the LMM can be found in Marras et al. (1992).  2.5.2.  LBD risk index  SpeciÔ¨Åc trunk kinematics and static trunk moment was input into a Low Back Disorder (LBD) risk model that predicts `probability of membership in the high risk low-back disorder group‚Äô. The LBD risk index is based on a probability estimate that incorporates Ô¨Åve kine- matic and workplace variables (maximum sagittal Ô¨Çexion position, lift rate, maximum external moment, maximum lateral velocity, and average twisting velocity) through logistic regression methods (Marras et al., 1993, 1995). The LBD risk index provides an estimate of how likely the condition resembles a ‚Äúhigh risk‚Äù job in industry.  2.5.3. Horizontal moment arm and static load moment  Moment arm measurements were also collected by one of the investigators (KD) using a standard tape measure. The moment arm was measured as the horizontal distance between the low back (at the expected L5/S1 level) and the center of the hands where the object was grasped. The maximum external load moment (in Nm) was deÔ¨Åned as the product of the horizontal moment arm (in meters) times the measured weight of the object being lifted (converted from kg to N).  2.5.4.  Subjective ratings  Immediately following the completion of the task condition with either of the carts, participants were asked to give a Rating of  
288  K.G. Davis, L. Orta An√©s / Applied Ergonomics 45 (2014) 285e292  6 ¬º very, Perceived Exertion (RPE, Borg‚Äôs scale, very light to 20 ¬º very, very hard) (Borg, 1982). Borg‚Äôs RPE is measure of a whole body exertion level. The RPE provides an estimate of the perceived effort level. After all task conditions were completed with each of the carts, two follow-up questions were asked to gather perceptions about usability and productivity. The Ô¨Årst question was ‚ÄúPlease rate how easy the adjustable cart was to use?‚Äù which was scored on a 10- point Likert scale (1d‚ÄúVery DifÔ¨Åcult‚Äù to 10d‚ÄúVery Easy‚Äù). The second question was ‚ÄúThe intervention cart allowed me to work‚Äù which was scored on a 10-point Likert scale (1d‚ÄúMuch Slower Than Normal‚Äù to 10d‚ÄúMuch Faster Than Normal‚Äù).  2.5.5. NIOSH lifting index  The NIOSH 1991 lifting equation (Waters et al., 1994) was uti- lized to calculate the cumulative lift index (CLI) was for each lift condition and cart. The following methods and assumptions were utilized: 1) horizontal distance was measured by tape measure (using method described above for horizontal moment arm), 2) Vertical distance of object was measured at the origin and desti- nation with the cart being the destination for 2-L bottles, soup cans, and bags of dog food and the origin for 12-pack of soda), 3) Vertical travel distance was the difference between the origin and desti- nation heights with a minimum of 10 cm (e.g. DM factor capped at 1.0), 4) Frequency was estimated to be 166 units per hour for both carts and thus contribute to the LI equally (includes both lifting and break time), 5) Coupling was viewed as fair for bags of dog food, 12- pack of soda, and box of soup and good for 2-L of soda that had handles, and 6) Asymmetry was estimated by video and was typically 90 for soup, 2-L, and 12-pack of soda and 0 for dog food since they carried the bags at signiÔ¨Åcant distance between carts. The LI was then calculated by multiplying the load constant by the resulting multipliers.  2.6.  Procedure  One member of the research team communicated with each of the participants using a set Spanish script. After being briefed about the study, the stocker was provided a consent form (Spanish version), which was then read and signed. The research team member conÔ¨Årmed the understanding of the consent pro- cess through a verbal script. Next, the research team measured the anthropometric dimensions including body weight, body stature, body segment lengths, and trunk depth and breadth. The participant was then Ô¨Åtted with a lumbar motion monitor. The four task conditions were then completed in random order. The stockers were instructed to lift normally, which typically corre- sponded to completing the lifts as fast as they can, given they are under time restraints and paid by the amount of material deliv- ered. The pattern of placing the products on the cart or shelf was not designated and left to the discretion of the stocker. The traditional cart was loaded/unloaded Ô¨Årst for each condition fol- lowed by the Adjustable Ergo Cart. While the carts were not randomized which would have been the ideal, the order was facilitated by attempting to capture a good comparison between the carts and concentrating on normal lifting activity. For the LMM data collection, each transfer of product was recorded from the point of lifting the product (e.g. hands connect to product) to the point of release (e.g. hand release product on cart or shelf). This interval is standard for LMM data collection and allows the capture of every lift for each condition. After each task condition was completed with each cart, the participant rated the perceived exertion (RPE). When both carts were complete for a task con- dition, the participant rated the productivity and usability of the Adjustable Ergo Cart relative to the traditional cart. A stopwatch  was utilized to collect the total time to complete each task con- dition with each cart. All 15 participants completed all four task conditions with both carts.  2.7. Data collection and analyses  The trunk kinematic data were collected through the Ballet software that accompanies the lumbar motion monitor and com- putes the kinematic dependent variables of interest. All kinematic data were entered into a database for subsequent analyses. The horizontal moment arms, weight of objects, heights at origin and destination, and perceived ratings were measured by a research team member and manually entered into the database. The data- base was randomly scanned for data entry errors. LBD risk index was calculated for each lift using the appropriate exponential equations (Marras et al., 1993). The cumulative lifting index was computed using the workplace measurements and product weight for the entire task condition for each of the carts (e.g. 4 CLIs for each cart and subject). Anthropometric data was entered into a separate database with descriptive statistics being calculated to provide a summary of the body dimensions of the subjects.  2.8.  Statistical analyses  For all variables, descriptive statistics were computed providing means and standard deviations as a function of intervention and intervention by task condition interaction. Values were reported when statistical signiÔ¨Åcance was found using the appropriate parametric or non-parametric statistical procedures. The contin- uous dependent variables were analyzed using a Split-plot Repeated Measures Analysis of Variance (ANOVA). For all signiÔ¨Å- cant independent variables, post-hoc analyses (Tukey multiple pairwise comparisons) were performed to determine the source of the signiÔ¨Åcant effect(s) (p < 0.05). For perceived rating of exertion and subjective dependent variables, non-parametric statistical an- alyses were completed. A KruskaleWallis one-way Analysis of Variance by ranks procedure was utilized to determine signiÔ¨Åcant main effects for intervention and task condition. Since the inter- vention main effect was the important effect and it only had two levels, no post hoc follow-up tests were necessary to determine the source of the signiÔ¨Åcance.  3. Results  <  The results of the Analysis of Variance tests are shown in Table 1. For the intervention main effect, several variables were found to be signiÔ¨Åcant (p 0.05) including maximum sagittal Ô¨Çexion, maximum right twist, maximum sagittal velocity, maximum twist velocity, static moment arm at destination, static trunk moment, and LBD risk index. The LBD risk index was the only task condition by intervention interaction that was found signiÔ¨Åcant. Overall, almost all of the trunk kinematic variables and the load moment variable were signiÔ¨Åcant (p < 0.0001) for the main effect of task condition (e.g. grocery product lifted). Since the differences be- tween the conditions was expected and not the focus of this study, the results will be concentrated signiÔ¨Åcant main effects of inter- vention and interaction effect with task condition (e.g., LBD risk index for the interaction).  3.1.  Trunk posture and velocity  The Adjustable Ergo Cart (intervention) resulted in signiÔ¨Åcantly (29 22.5 ) less sagittal Ô¨Çexion by approximately vs. but increased twisting position by 1.5 (6 vs. 7.5 ) as compared to the traditional cart. Similar trends were found for sagittal and twist  7  
trunk velocity where there was a reduction of 4.5 /s (26 /s vs. 21.6 / s) for sagittal but an increase of 4 /s (33.6 /s vs. 37.4 /s) for twist.  3.2. Horizontal moment arms and static moment  As expected, the origin horizontal moment arm was not signiÔ¨Åcantly inÔ¨Çuenced by the intervention cart (on average both carts produced a moment arm of approximately 43 cm). However, the horizontal moment arm at the destination was signiÔ¨Åcantly reduced by the interventiondabout 4 cm (52.3 cm vs. 48.6 cm). This difference in moment arm translated into a reduction in the static trunk load moment, by about 2 Nm (32.8 Nm vs. 30.7 Nm). Notice, the origin moment arm was measured at the start for all conditions whether it started on the shelf or on the cart with destination measured at the end of the lift.  3.3.  Probability of high risk group membership (LBD risk index)  Overall, the LBD risk index was reduced by 2.4% when the Adjustable Ergo Cart was used as compared to the traditional cart. However, the impact of the intervention depended upon the task condition (Fig. 2). The reduction in LBD risk index was isolated primarily to the 2-L bottles of soda (about 5.5%) and bags of dog food (about 5%). For the other two task conditions, there was no signiÔ¨Åcant difference with less than 1% difference.  3.4.  Time to complete tasks  Overall, there was a signiÔ¨Åcant reduction in the time to com- plete the lifting tasks when using the Adjustable Ergo Cart as compared to the traditional cart. The reduction was about 3-s for each task condition. Although this effect was not signiÔ¨Åcant, likely due to the variability in how people utilized the cart, the differences would represent a potential for increased productivity.  3.5.  Perceptions about the intervention  The rating of perceived exertion (RPE) was signiÔ¨Åcantly greater for the traditional cart as compared to the Adjustable Ergo Cart (a 1.8 point difference on the 6 to 20 point scaled10.6 vs. 8.8). Fig. 3 shows the interaction effect of the cart and lift condition where the Adjustable Ergo Cart had lower RPEs (approximately 2 points lower) for all the task conditions except for bags of dog food (around 0.5 points). After the completion of all task conditions, participants were asked two additional perception questions about the Adjustable Ergo Cart intervention. First, the participants rated the ‚ÄúEase of use‚Äù for the Adjustable Ergo Cart with an average rating of 8.33 on a scale of 1e10 (Strong tendency toward ‚ÄúVery Easy to Use‚Äù). More telling results are the frequency of each response where 5 (out of 15) reported a ‚Äú10‚Äù (or ‚Äúvery easy‚Äù), 6 reported a ‚Äú9‚Äù, 2 reported ‚Äú8‚Äù (or ‚Äúeasy‚Äù) while only 2 reported below ‚Äú6‚Äù or  Table 1 Summary of the p-values for the Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) procedures for trunk kinematics, moment arm, trunk moment, LBD risk index, and time to complete task (Bold values indicate signiÔ¨Åcance at p < 0.05).

The participants as a whole rated the Adjustable Ergo Cart as allowing them to be more productive than normal (average rating of 7.47 on a 1 to 10 scale). Twelve of the 15 partic- ipants rated the Adjustable Ergo Cart as being ‚Äúfaster than normal‚Äù with a rating of 8 or above.  3.6. NIOSH lifting index  With only a few of the multipliers being impacted by the intervention cart, the lifting index was only marginally impacted by the use of the Adjustable Ergo Cart but it was signiÔ¨Åcant at p ¬º 0.002. The average CLI for the Ergo Cart was 1.43 as compared to the traditional cart at 1.62 (about 0.2 drop).  4. Discussion  Overall, the Adjustable Ergo Cart was found to be only a marginally effective intervention for controlling the awkward pos- tures and LBD risk associated with stocking groceries in a store. The Adjustable Ergo Cart reduced the sagittal trunk motion, static trunk load moment, LBD risk index, and NIOSH CLI but higher trunk twisting motion as compared to the traditional cart. This may have partially resulted by the size and maneuverability of the Adjustable Ergo Cart relative to the traditional cart. The smaller Adjustable Ergo Cart was able to be positioned closer to the shelves and have a slightly different stacking pattern. As a result, the stockers would pivot and twist rapidly when using the Adjustable Ergo Cart rather than taking a small step as was observed with the traditional cart. Better place- ment of the cart may reduce the twist motion, thus increasing the effectiveness of the intervention for grocery item selectors. The trade-off between sagittal and twist was not exactly equal since when the overall trunk motion was taken into account in the LBD risk index, the Adjustable Ergo Cart reduced the LBD risk index (e.g. probability of high risk group membership) as compared to the traditional cart. But, the task condition had a role in the resulting LBD risk index where the Adjustable Ergo Cart was more effective for more bulky material such as 4-pack of 2-L bottles and medium bags of dog food. Based on known benchmarks for the LBD risk index (Marras et al., 1999a,b), the traditional cart with the medium bags of dog food would be considered a high risk job (approaching the 60% probability) but the Adjustable Ergo Cart resulted in a risk that was more than 5% lower, which would reduce the likelihood of being high risk. In fact, the number of individual lifts above the 60% LBD Risk level went from 53% for the traditional cart to 29% for the Adjustable Ergo Cart. For the 2-L bottles, the risk was also reduced by 5%, which represents a signiÔ¨Åcant improvement and beneÔ¨Åt. The percentage of individual lifts of 2-L bottles above the 60% level was 56% for the traditional cart and 2.2% for the Adjustable Ergo Cart. But, none of the lifting conditions when using either of the carts was low risk (less than 30%) based on the benchmarks set by Marras et al. (1999a,b). One interesting trend in the LBD Risk was for the smaller items (6-packs of soda and 24-cans of soup) where the LBD risk was identical for both the Adjustable Ergo and traditional carts. While it is unclear the exact nature for the lack of a difference, a few po- tential concerns may have been the underlying factors: 1) smaller boxes may have required more precision to place, 2) lighter weights resulted in more of direct trade-off between sagittal and non- sagittal trunk motion, and 3) workers tended to remain bent over (Ô¨Çexed forward) during the entire condition for these two products. The fact that the NIOSH CLI was only marginally improved (1.6e 1.4) when using the Adjustable Ergo Cart was not a complete sur- prise as many of the multipliers were not affected by the inter- vention. The following multipliers were the same for both carts: lift frequency (assumed to be same), coupling (e.g. cart did not affect  coupling), asymmetry (e.g. carts were placed in the approximate same position), and weight of the objects (e.g. same products were lifted for both carts). The horizontal distancedmaximum of the moment arm at origin and destination, vertical distance at origin (limited to 12-pack of soda cans), and vertical travel distance were the only multipliers that varied between the two carts. As a result, the change in the CLI was minimally impacted. The Adjustable Ergo Cart reduced the trunk Ô¨Çexion by elimi- nating low-level lifts at the cart, which have been found to be the most detrimental with regard to spine loads. Marras et al. (1997) reported that the middle to bottom levels of a pallet (e.g. below the waist and mid-thigh level) produced substantially greater three-dimensional loads on the spine. When the boxes were lifted from mid-thigh to waist level from the pallet, the loads were much closer to acceptable loads. Other researchers have also reported increased spine loads when lifting from low height shelves, particularly below knee height (Hoozemans et al., 2008; Kingma et al., 2004; Lavender et al., 2003). The adjustable cart interven- tion would be equivalent to lifting from the middle rows of a pallet (approximately at the height of the mid-thigh) at the cart position, likely reducing spine loads. However, the measured beneÔ¨Åt of the cart was likely minimized due the focus on only one part of the transferring of the product including lifting from the low height shelving. Thus, the current intervention, Adjustable Ergo Cart, may have been marginally effective due to the cart being one compo- nent of the overall system. As such, the intervention does not address the one part of the transfer that has been identiÔ¨Åed as having high spine loads by the previous researchers. Another positive result of using the Adjustable Ergo Cart was the stockers‚Äô perception of a lower required exertion level as well as increased usability and productivity. Thus, the subjective support the objective measures in that the Adjustable Ergo Cart provides a marginal beneÔ¨Åt to the stockers. The results also indicate that the Adjustable Ergo Cart would be a viable intervention that workers would actually utilize and not collect dust in the corner. Anecdotal evidence of intervention buy-in was observed by the research team where stockers commented about how they could take ownership of the two carts provided the grocery store. The use of the Adjustable Ergo Cart also reduced the time to complete the stocking tasks. The decrease in time to perform a stocking task would represent an improvement in productivity. However, a casual observation from comments from the stockers was that the shelf of the Adjustable Ergo Cart was too small and would increase the number of trips between warehouse and shelves in the store. On the other hand, observations of the stockers completing trips between the warehouse and shelves indicated that many of the trips had partially Ô¨Ålled carts. As a result, the smaller surface area for the Adjustable Ergo Cart may not be a major issue with respect to additional trips but certainly inÔ¨Çuences the stacking pattern of the products (discussed below).  4.1. Other considerations  Several potential limitations need to be considered when interpreting the results. First, study conditions were determined by real situations rather than scientiÔ¨Åc control. The project was designed to be a demonstration project to investigate the utility of an adjustable height cart for stocking of groceries. Thus, several design issues were not controlled including the cart size, stacking patterns, shelf heights, and limited types of product. One of the major differences between the Traditional and Adjustable Ergo Cart is the size of the platform where the Adjustable Ergo Cart is dramatically different. The result of the size difference for the platform and lack of stacking directions was different patterns of stacking between the two carts. While other platforms sizes are  
K.G. Davis, L. Orta An√©s / Applied Ergonomics 45 (2014) 285e292  291  available, the current version was selected prior to arriving at the study site and was selected for cost considerations (e.g. cheapest of the available models). As a result, part of the improvements may have been attributed to the difference in stacking that resulted. In an optimal world, the cart platforms would have been identical but the current cart is a viable and available cart, a key component of the project. Further, the grocery products selected may also contribute to the differences as they affected the stacking pattern on the carts as well as inÔ¨Çuenced the lifting movements. Other products need to be investigated with respect to the beneÔ¨Åt of the adjustable cart. Further, products were lifted from and to the bot- tom shelves, representing the worse case scenario and thus inÔ¨Çu- encing the outcome variables. In all, the study design was not optimal but provides a practical evaluation of the adjustable cart. Second, the study was an observational study that was limited to a very short observation period (less than an hour for each cart). The long-term impact of the Adjustable Ergo Cart needs to be considered to obtain information of the reduction of injuries as well as compliance in using such an intervention. The current study was able to demonstrate the utility of the Adjustable Ergo Cart to eliminate the need to bend to place products below waist level. Third, the Adjustable Ergo Cart represents one type of adjustable cart where other adjustable carts could produce different results, particularly given the previous size of the platform discussion. The major objective of the current study was to demonstrate the effec- tiveness of adjustable height cart in reducing the risk for low back injuries. As such, the concept of placing objects on the cart above the mid-thigh level was found to be a viable way to reduce awkward postures during grocery stocking. It would be expected that carts with similar height adjustability would be equally effective. Fourth, the stockers in this study were all males and represented a sample of convenience. The participants represented the stockers who were available on the data collection dates. It is possible that females would have interacted with the Adjustable Ergo Cart, with different lifting technique. Future studies investigating adjustment height cart interventions need to evaluate female workers. Fifth, the study quantiÔ¨Åed the trunk kinematics, LBD risk index, and the NIOSH cumulative lifting index during the lifting of the product. No assessment was made for the push force, which could have been different between the two carts, particularly given the age of the traditional carts and the smaller size of the Adjustable Ergo Cart. In order to understand whether the Adjustable Ergo Cart re- duces the overall risk, an assessment of the push and pulling forces should be completed. Further, the assessment was comprehensive but lacked more concrete biomechanical assessments such as spine loading estimates. Spine loading could provide additional insight into changes in the mechanical loading that would be expected from the observed alterations in trunk motions. It would further account for potential muscle co-activation patterns that could be inÔ¨Çuenced by the lifting technique adopted by the workers. Sixth, another consideration for the adoption of the Adjustable Ergo Cart as a viable intervention would be the usability of the cart, which was out of the scope of this project. One key situation that may inÔ¨Çuence the usability and effectiveness of the cart is when item selectors are stocking the lower shelf on their knees. Again, this technique was not observed and thus, the results cannot be extrapolated to using Adjustable Ergo Cart while kneeling. Although these limitations need to be considered, the results of the study provided valuable documentation of the kinematic and subjective alterations that implementing an adjustable cart could have for the stocker in the grocery store. The bottom line was that the cart reduced the trunk Ô¨Çexion and reduced the static load moment, but slightly increased the twisting, resulting in a marginal decrease in LBD risk (risk index and NIOSH CLI). Given the positive subjective perceptions, the adjustable cart would also appear to be  a viable intervention that would be routinely utilized in stocking activities in grocery stores.  4.2. Where do we go from here?  Although the results of the current study are intriguing, the adjustable cart only addresses one aspect of the exposures for MSDs in grocery stores, particularly in small business locations like the ones visited in Puerto Rico. Further, interventions need to not only be effective but also cost efÔ¨Åcient (e.g. low cost). An adjustable cart like the one evaluated in this study typically costs more than $800 (USD), which would be very prohibitive in many stores and busi- nesses. In addition, interventions that reduce the weight of the product (e.g. smaller containers) and the number of repetitions need to be investigated. However, current proÔ¨Åt margins and other industry economic concerns may limit the effectiveness of such interventions. Furthermore, the current intervention addresses the low heights at the cart and neglects lifts from low heights at the shelf. Additional interventions need to target lifting from and to low shelves in all areas of the grocery store, not eliminating these low shelves but developing specialized interventions that reduce the risk from lifting to and from the low shelves. The combination of interventions at the shelf and cart would likely lead to signiÔ¨Åcant and meaningful reduction in LBD risk factors rather than the mar- ginal reductions found for the Adjustable Ergo Cart only. Thus, the control of low back injuries and other MSDs in grocery stores and other retail businesses will need to be multifaceted and probably require more than one device or intervention.  5.  Conclusion  With many ergonomic exposures being identiÔ¨Åed for industries with the Wholesale, Retail and Trade sector, the need to identify effective interventions has become a prioritydresearch to practice. The current study investigates one such intervention that targeted lifting to and from low heights at the cart in grocery store stocking tasks. The Adjustable Ergo Cart allowed the workers to place the products at mid-thigh height, thus reducing the need to lift from a forward Ô¨Çexed posture. The elimination of forward Ô¨Çexion would potentially reduce the risk of low back injuries, particularly for bulky and heavy products. However, based on the LBD risk index and NIOSH CLI, the Adjustable Ergo Cart was only a marginally effective intervention to eliminate risk to stockers. Future work needs to identify and investigate interventions that reduce the weight of products, reduce lifting from the low height shelves in the ware- house and store, and reduce the number of lifts per worker. The bottom line was that an adjustable height cart can only be minimally effective in reducing the detrimental exposures found in stocking of grocery products, given that the focus of the intervention is at the cart and neglects the shelving which is oftentimes at low levels.

s0003687013000835,"  In Test Cricket, players typically spend considerable amounts of time under conditions of high thermal stress, both externally from environmental factors, and internally from increased heat pro- duction by the body, resulting in higher body temperature. To reduce the high temperature, the body perspires or produces sweat. As the perspiration evaporates and is transmitted to atmo- sphere, the body temperature is reduced and the body feels cooler (√ñzdil et al., 2007). Research has established that the human head plays an important role in thermoregulation; up to 50% of latent and sensible heat produced by the body is dissipated through the head, as an effect of increased temperatures and sweat production (Rasch et al., 1991; Desruelle and Candas, 2000; Jun et al., 2010). The primary function of protective helmets is to prevent wearers from impact-related head injuries. The helmet shell,  * Corresponding author.

As a result, helmet usage and design could have a considerable bearing on thermal comfort. Hence, understanding the thermal behaviour of the head is important to form a basis for design and optimization of helmets for thermal comfort and to reduce heat strain to wearers (Bogerd and Br√ºhwiler, 2008; De Bruyne et al., 2010). Many researchers have developed a number of theories and models to analyse and understand thermal comfort (Lotens and Havenith, 1991; Fan and Chen, 2002; Mccullough and Kenney, 2003; Ogulata, 2007; Qian and Fan, 2009; Wang et al., 2011). In general, research in thermal comfort to date has primarily focused on how humans perceive thermal comfort of different textiles and apparel rather than on objective quantitative measures. For the purpose of this study, proven theories and models that are related to sports apparel comfort will be adopted. Most of the recreational and international cricket games are played in an environment with little wind effect or low air velocity conditions (McGrath and Finch, 1996; Joshi, 2009), hence, for a  0003-6870/$ e see front matter √ì 2013 Elsevier Ltd and The Ergonomics Society.

This heat will be transferred from the body to the environment through three basic mechanisms by: (i) conduction; (ii) convection; and (iii) radiation. However, conduction is not relevant in thermal interac- tion of human body and environment (ASHRAE Handbook, 2009). Hence, the mechanisms of heat transfer from the human body to the environment can be classiÔ¨Åed as (a) the dry heat transfer (C √æ R ¬º the sum of the convection C and radiation R heat transfer), which is mainly governed by the mean temperature gradient be- tween the clothed body surface and the environment (see Fig. 1), and (b) the evaporative heat transfer (He) governed by the differ- ence between the water vapour pressure at the skin and that of the ambient air and by the degree of skin wetness (Mccullough and Kenney, 2003;Voelker et al., 2009; Cengel and Ghajar, 2011). The inÔ¨Çuence of clothing on heat stress depends on the extent to which the clothing affects the heat and moisture transfer between the wearer and the environment. The two main properties of the clothing that affect the thermal balance between the wearer and the environment are the thermal resistance (Rct) and the evapo- rative resistance (Ret) (Song et al., 2011). In helmets the intrinsic thermal resistance (Rcf) represents the resistance to heat transfer between the helmet surface and the skin and is a characteristic of the helmet ensemble itself, which is independent of the external environment and the body‚Äôs condition. Previous research has concentrated on the evaluation of heat transfer of cricket helmets without taking into consideration the sweating effect (Pang et al., 2013). However, a complete under- standing of human heat exchange requires not only the convective, conductive and radiative heat losses to be measured but also this other important mechanism of heat dissipation, namely sweat evaporation (Celcar et al., 2008). In recent years, in order to fully understand the thermal behaviour of clothing systems, thermal manikins with human features (i.e. capable of generating heat and perspiration), have been used successfully in experimental in- vestigations (Chen et al., 2003; Ogulata, 2007; Celcar et al., 2008; Wang et al., 2011). Among several known sweating thermal manikins (Chen et al., 2003; Ogulata, 2007; Celcar et al., 2008; Wang et al., 2011), the  Fig. 1. SimpliÔ¨Åed clothing/helmet heat transfer model.  thermal manikin ‚ÄòNewton‚Äô from Measurement Technology North- west is built in accordance with ASTM and ISO standards and is widely used for garment and environmental heat loss evaluation. The manikin surface is divided into separate sections, each of which has its own sweating, heating and temperature measuring system. Each thermal zone has sweat control through evenly distributed Ô¨Çuid ports on its surface and sweating rate can be controlled by an operator (Wang, 2008; Measurement Technology Northwest, 2010) The whole ‚ÄòNewton‚Äô manikin system produced reasonable results as compared against human trial studies (Blood and Burke, 2010). The aim of this experimental study is to establish an approach to determine the thermal and evaporative resistance of a range of cricket helmets using the sweating thermal manikin measure- ments. These measurements would provide physical values related the heat and moisture transfer properties of helmet ensemble. Such values could contribute to the evaluation of the thermal comfort of helmet assembles, and could be used to improve helmet design by maximizing protection and minimizing thermal insulation and water vapour resistance for summer wear.  2. Materials and methods  2.1. Helmets  Five different models of commercially available cricket helmets were selected and tested in this research (Fig. 2). These reference helmets were the same as those used in the previous study con- ducted by the authors (Pang et al., 2013) to quantify the net heat transfer of the headgear under non-sweating conditions.  2.2.  The sweating manikin  The sweating manikin called the ‚ÄòNewton‚Äô, operated by the automatic control software ThermDAC (Measurement Technology Northwest), was used in this research (Measurement Technology Northwest, 2010). The manikin was installed hanging in an up- right standing position in the centre of a climatic chamber at the Manikin Laboratory of the School of Fashion and Textile, RMIT University. The manikin was operated statically without any body movement. The manikin consists of 20 independently controlled thermal zones (see Fig. 3). All thermal zones are Ô¨Åtted with heaters to simulate metabolic heat output rates and use distributed wire sensors for measuring skin temperatures. The surface temperatures of all zones were set to 35.0  C. The surface temperature, heat Ô¨Çux and heat loss were measured continuously at 10 s intervals for at least 80 min.  2.3.  Experimental procedure  All the tests were conducted in a controlled laboratory within the acceptable ranges as speciÔ¨Åed in the International standards (ISO, 1995; ASTM F1291, 2010; ASTM F2370, 2010). The air was steady Ô¨Çowing from the chamber roof and was controlled under minimal air velocity at 0.08  0.01 m/s for both dry and wet tests. Since the manikin ‚ÄòNewton‚Äô is not design to measure clothing thermal insulation and moisture vapour resistance at the same time. Therefore, two separate measurements were required: (1) dry test, and (2) wet test (Measurement Technology Northwest, 2010).  2.3.1. Dry test  In the dry test condition the manikin was covered with a ‚Äòskin‚Äô suit where sweat is absent (Fig. 4). The testing environment was set at a Temperature (T) of 23  0.5  C, and a Relative Humidity (RH) of 50  5% to simulate the dry conditions. The dry heat loss was

The dry test measurements were then used as a reference for the wet test.  cricket helmet. The 80-minute duration was set to allow sufÔ¨Åcient time for the helmeted-manikin to reach steady-state condition and at maximum saturation in moisture absorption, if there is any.  2.3.2. Wet test  For the purpose of measuring the evaporative resistance of the helmet on the ‚Äònaked‚Äô manikin, wet tests were conducted in an isothermal condition, whereby both ambient temperature of the climate chamber and the mean skin temperature of the manikin were set to T ¬º 35  0.5  C. The relative humidity was controlled at RH ¬º 40  5%. The isothermal condition was used to ensure that no dry heat loss and no condensation would occur, thus enabling the evaporative heat loss to be measured alone (Havenith et al., 2008; Richards et al., 2008; Wang et al., 2011). The skin suit was pre-wetted by spraying the distilled water from a spray bottle over the skin. In addition to this pre-wetting proce- dure, the wet-naked test, without helmets, was run for about 1¬Ω  2 h  1. The wet-naked tests hours with a perspiration rate of 700 gm were performed before the wet-test in order to evenly distribute the moisture over the skin to simulate skin saturated with sweat. During the wet-test, the perspiration rate of the manikin was set  2 h  1 to keep the manikin surface moist. Measurements to 300 gm were taken for 80 min after covering the manikin‚Äôs head with a  2.4.  Theoretical background  The two main helmet propertiesdi.e. thermal resistance (Rct) and evaporative resistance (Ret) (Fig. 1)dwhich affect the thermal balance between the wearer and the environment, were calculated from experimental measurements. The equations used to calculate the relevant parameters are as follows (ASTM F1291, 2010; ASTM F2370, 2010; Measurement Technology Northwest, 2010; Song et al., 2011):  2.4.1. Dry thermal resistance, Rct  When the manikin is not sweating, the average thermal resis- tance, which is used to deÔ¨Åne the insulation between the skin surface and the environment under dry conditions, is calculated for each zone in the following way:  (2)  Rct ¬º √∞Tskin   Tamb √û  .

The term [(Tskin   Tamb)/Rct] is equal to dry heat loss (W/m2), which is the heat Ô¨Çux under dry conditions. This has been subtracted from the heat Ô¨Çux, qwet, so that Ret captures the effect of the moisture alone.

It should be noted that the Newton model measures the clothing thermal insulation in the dry test or the moisture vapour resistance in the wet test based on previous dry test at a non-isothermal condition.  2.4.3.

Rct and Ret represent the average thermal resistance under dry condition and average evaporative resistance under wet condition, respectively.  It can be seen in Fig. 5 that during the Ô¨Årst 10 min after a helmet was secured on the manikin head, a large variation in surface temperature was recorded. After that, the surface temperature in the head zone reached a steady-state condition; the temperature Ô¨Çuctuated within the range of 35  1  C and was maintained for the entire duration of the test. The coefÔ¨Åcient of variance of the temperature during the steady state condition was maintained within 5%.  3.1. Dry thermal resistances  In this study, the dry thermal resistance (Rct) and the evapora- tive resistance (Ret) of each helmet were measured. The measure- ments were obtained in controlled conditions for the manikin head without a helmet, and for the manikin head wearing Ô¨Åve different helmets (see Table 1). All values presented here are steady-state values for the face and head zones. The ambient air temperature in the climatic chamber was main- tained at w23  C and the mean skin temperatures averaged w35  C. In these controlled conditions, the thermal insulation value measured for the manikin with helmet ensemble ranges from 1.0 to 1.2 clo. The clo values of each helmet do not differ signiÔ¨Åcantly under dry testing conditions.  3.2.  Evaporative resistances and permeability index  (5)  Helmets with similar thermal resistance can demonstrate sub- stantially different evaporative resistance. For example when comparing the NXT, Premiere and Ultimate helmets, although having very similar thermal resistance (0.17  C m2 W  1), the Pre- miere and Ultimate helmets have signiÔ¨Åcantly lower evaporative resistance, which are 20% lower than that of the NXT helmet. Ref represents the resistance to moisture transfer between the skin and the helmet outer surface. Table 2 shows that Ref increases signiÔ¨Åcantly when a helmet is present. The permeability index was calculated for each helmet and the overall permeability index, measured at the head and face zones, for all Ô¨Åve helmets ranged from 0.22 to 0.26.  2.4.4.  Permeability index  Permeability is the ability of water vapor to move through clothing. It affects the amount of evaporative cooling that can occur, whereby it is calculated as follows:  Fig. 5.

Heat dissipation  Heat dissipation from the manikin surface to the environment consists of two parts: (i) the dry heat loss C √æ R (convection, con- duction and radiation); and (ii) the evaporative heat loss He. The results for dry heat dissipation from the naked manikin and the manikin wearing different helmet models are shown in Fig. 6. The dry heat loss calculated from the dry manikin measure- ments ranged from 4.04 to 4.77 and 4.51 to 5.21 for the face and head zones, respectively. Marginal variations in heat loss among the helmets were observed in both the head and face zones. However, in comparison with the naked manikin, the presence of a helmet has signiÔ¨Åcantly impeded the dry heat loss at the head section, where the dry heat loss was reduced by 50% for most helmets. The results for evaporative heat loss show much smaller varia- tion in the face zone in comparison with those in the head, where the differences vary from 19% to 55%. Differences were more sig- niÔ¨Åcant between the NXT and the Elite helmets. Plots for heat Ô¨Çux versus time for the face and head zones are depicted separately for each helmet in Fig. 7. The heat Ô¨Çux increases rapidly during the Ô¨Årst 5 min of the experiment, gradually de- creases in the next 5 min and then eventually plateaus to reach the steady-state condition. The average heat Ô¨Çux at the steady-state  2 and from 46 to 70 Wm condition ranged from 83 to 140 Wm for the face and head zones respectively.   2  4. Discussion  This article presents, for the Ô¨Årst time, the thermal-manikin- based experimental data on thermal and evaporative resistance of Ô¨Åve cricket helmets of different designs. The thermal and evapo- rative resistance of a speciÔ¨Åc ensemble can be determined in several ways, with a varying level of accuracy, reproducibility of measurement and cost involved (Lotens and Havenith, 1989; Fan and Chen, 2002; Qian and Fan, 2009). The helmets were tested on an instrumented sweating manikin in a controlled climatic chamber. The manikin measured the helmet thermal and evapo- rative resistance in a stationary standing position with minimal air  Table 2 Evaporative thermal resistance for each helmet measured on hand and face region.

It was important to perform the ‚ÄòNewton‚Äô manikin experiments in standardised conditions in order to understand the basic principles and to establish an approach that can be used later to analyse the measurements taken in dynamic conditions. The experiments were conducted in two stages, namely dry test and wet test (Wang, 2008; Measurement Technology Northwest, 2010). The dry tests were conducted in non-isothermal conditions and were to measure the dry thermal insulation in the absence of sweat; whereas the wet tests were conducted in isothermal con- ditions, and together with the data obtained from the previous dry test, data collected were used to calculate the evaporative resis- tance values for each helmet ensembles. Each experiment lasted for 80 min with water continuously supplied to the manikin to simu- late the sweating effect. At the beginning of the test, there were large variations in surface temperatures as the helmets were kept at room temperature. After 10 min, both the face and head surface temperatures attained a steady-state level of 35 C, which was maintained for the entire duration of the experiment (Fig. 5).  4.1. Dry thermal resistances of helmet ensembles  The total thermal resistances Rct and Rcf are attributes that ac- count for a decrease in heat Ô¨Çow due to total insulation provided by the helmet components and the air layer between the skin and the helmet. The higher the value of Rct, the lower net heat dissipation due to radiation and convection is achieved. In general, the values of Rct range from 0.1 for the surface of a naked body to 0.2 for the helmets tested (Table 1), which are within the scope of Rct that have

Elite helmet is the only helmet which possesses a 5 mm-thick lining that covers the entire inner surface of the helmet shell. A considerable amount of moisture was trapped and accu- mulated in the liner during the experiment. Such moisture reduces both the thermal and evaporative resistance of the helmet ensemble and hence increases the total heat dissipation from the wearer (Lotens et al., 1995; Havenith et al., 2008; Richards et al., 2008). Furthermore, it is reported that absorbed water in the clothing layer increases both heat capacity and thermal conduc- tivity. With an increased water content more heat can be stored, while at the same time the heat conduction to the outer surface increases as well (Voelker et al., 2009). It is shown in Table 2 that the evaporative resistance of the Elite helmet is slightly lower than that of the reference naked head. A possible explanation is that the water captured within the ‚Äòskin‚Äô suit can either diffuse through the materials (comfort padding, liners and foam) used in the helmet, escape through the helmet via the vent holes as vapour condensation occurs within the helmet ma- terials (Richards et al., 2008). During the experiment, it was noted that the liners and the paddings absorbed the moisture of the ‚Äòskin‚Äô suit. Hence, the humidity at the ‚Äòskin‚Äô suit surface was less than 100%. In order to maintain the moisture of the skin suit at 100%, the manikin control system makes adjustments to the rate by increasing moisture content and thus releasing the heat. Moreover, the condensation would remain within the helmet ensembles. Published research has shown that condensation is responsible for the additional heat loss (Lawson et al., 2004; Richards et al., 2008). This is the speculated reason why evaporative resistance of the helmet ensembles can be lower than that in the naked head test (Chen et al., 2003). The moisture vapour permeability characteristic of the material used in a cloth ensemble is an important parameter that affects the thermal comfort. It represents moisture permeability of clothing relative to its level of insulation and its ability to transfer perspi- ration from the body to the environment (Mccullough and Kenney, 2003; Lee and Obendorf, 2007). Low permeability keeps the wearer warm by preventing the escape of body heat and/or water vapour (Mondal and Hu, 2007). The higher the value of im, the easier it is for the heat to be dissipated through the helmet by means of evaporative cooling. Consequently, high permeability index values are desirable for effective evaporative heat transfer and thermal comfort (Mccullough and Kenney, 2003): the higher the evapora- tive resistance, the less permeable the clothing is to moisture transfer or vice versa (Table 2). However, when the ambient hu- midity is high and wind speed is low, evaporative cooling becomes less effective and the dry thermal resistance becomes more important for dissipating heat (Gibson, 1993). In order to optimize the heat exchange properties of a helmet, parameters such as the thermal insulation and moisture vapour resistance of materials in addition to design and construction of the helmet should be considered. It has been reported that, currently, almost all sweating thermal manikins cannot control the wet skin surface temperature because there is no feedback between the wet textile fabric skin and the manikin‚Äôs controlling system (Wang et al., 2011). Depending on the measurement technique, testing conditions and the sweat gland construction, the reproducibility of the evaporative resistance values obtained from the sweating manikins may vary within a range from 50% to more than 100% (Richard and Mccullough, 2005; Wang et al., 2012). One of the main errors has been reported to come from the calculation of evaporative resistance using the manikin‚Äôs surface temperature. The thermal manikins tend to predict a slightly warmer skin temperatures that those of volun- teers for temperature ranges from 23 to 25  C (Rugh and Lustbader, 2006; Bogdan and Zwoli nska, 2012; Wang et al., 2012). In order to  Fig. 7. Evaporative heat Ô¨Çux versus time at the face and head zones for each helmet.  been reported elsewhere (Mccullough et al., 1985). The largest values of Rct and Rcf were observed for the Masuri helmet, followed by the Premiere and NXT helmets, and the smallest was that for the Elite helmet. Small differences existed between the thermal resis- tance values for the tested helmets under the dry test condition. One possible explanation is that the tests were conducted under controlled conditions of minimal air movement.  4.2. Evaporative resistances and permeability index of helmet ensembles  During the wet tests, the sweat rate of the manikin was  2 h  1, controlled at the level of 300 gm in order to simulate an individual sweating as a result from a moderate-to-high workload (Rehrer and Burke, 1996; Gonzalez et al., 2009). The evaporative resistance measures the amount of moisture trapped within the helmet ensemble. In Table 2, values for the evaporative resistance are averaged for each helmet and for the reference naked head. Most helmets transmitted 68e78% of evaporative heat compared with the naked head (assumed 100%). The evaporative resistance, Ret, varied between 36 and 60 m2 Pa W for the helmets, in  1 for the naked head. It was reported comparison with 45 m2 Pa W that Ret should be as low as possible to allow for the clothing layer to transport water vapour (Havelka and Kus, 2011). The Masuri helmet recorded the highest values of both thermal and evaporative resistance. The higher the value of evaporative resistance (always associated with low evaporative cooling or heat loss as shown in Figs. 6 and 7) the higher the level of heat stress. On the other hand, the Elite helmet showed lower resistance values (Rct and Rcf). The main reason for this difference between evapo- rative resistance values is probably the presence of a thick layer of   1  
306  T.Y. Pang et al.  / Applied Ergonomics 45 (2014) 300e307  minimise the error on the evaporative resistance values and to avoid the error of overestimating the heat stress level of wearers, Wang et al. (2011) has suggested the experiment should be per- formed in the isothermal conditions and the mass loss method should be used to calculate the clothing evaporative resistance. Therefore, the wet tests in the present study were conducted in isothermal conditions and the ‚ÄòNewton‚Äô thermal manikin uses the mass loss method to calculated the evaporative resistance, hence, the measurements presented in this paper, obtaining from the thermal manikin tests, can interpreted as an indicative results or used for comparative tests of different helmet models (Holm√©r, 2004).  4.3. Heat transfer through helmet ensembles  The total heat losses were calculated using equations (6) and (7). The values were mainly affected by the temperature difference between the skin surface and the environment under natural convection. By snugly Ô¨Åtting a cricket helmet to the head, it adds a layer of insulation to the head and face surfaces, thus reducing the heat loss from the covered area. The results for dry heat loss showed small differences in Hd values between helmets (Fig. 6). Comparing Hd with that for a naked head, the total dry heat loss was about 50% lower when wearing a cricket helmet. Similar values of dry heat loss have also been noted in previous research (Pang et al., 2013).  4.4.  Testing conditions  The standard testing methods used to determine the dry ther- mal resistance values do not measure the effects of air movement in a dynamic environment. During a cricket practice or game, higher levels of air velocity and body motion will increase the convective and evaporative heat loss from the player‚Äôs body. In fact, several reports show that heat transfer through clothing ensembles is signiÔ¨Åcantly affected by body and air movement (Mccullough and Hong, 1992; McCullough, 1993; Nilsson et al., 1998; Havenith et al., 2002; Qian and Fan, 2006). The static values presented in this paper may imply an overestimation of the actual insulation, whereby the actual heat loss may be greater. Further research is, therefore, needed in order to conÔ¨Årm the small differences in the dry thermal resistance observed in this study. It is acknowledged that some air is enclosed between the helmet and the head surface. This air acts as an insulator preventing heat transfer by conduction and radiation. Yoo et al. (2000) found that the thickness of the air layer is negatively correlated with the vapour pressure, which affects the wearer‚Äôs comfort. Likewise, previous research has demonstrated that the Rct and Ret measure- ments improve when the air gap is considered (Gibson, 1993). Therefore, future studies will need to be extended to consider the air gap between the helmet and the head. Although the measurements obtained from the thermal manikin are highly reproducible, no direct information on subjec- tive human responses such as comfort is available. By using a combination of human and laboratory thermal manikin tests, clothing systems can be studied from both psychological and thermal aspects (Mark and Niklaus, 2001). Future research on thermal comfort feedbackdmeasurement taken in Ô¨Åeld trails for the same helmets used by cricket playersdwould add value to the results presented in this paper.  5.  Conclusions  This research investigated the thermal and evaporative re- sistances of Ô¨Åve commercially available cricket helmets using the  ‚ÄúNewton‚Äô sweating manikin. All the experimental tests were con- ducted within an environmental chamber, where the temperature, humidity and wind velocity were controlled within the ranges speciÔ¨Åed in the relevant standards. The main conclusions stem- ming from this research are summarized as follows:  1. Cricket helmets impede the heat exchange between the head surface and the environment. The dry heat dissipation was reduced by upto 50% due to the presence of a helmet in the non-sweating manikin test. 2. There is no signiÔ¨Åcant difference between the tested helmets in terms of the thermal resistance measured under the dry test condition when the air movement in the climate chamber is small. 3. Tested helmets transmitted 68e78% of compared with the naked head. 4. The type and design of comfort padding may inÔ¨Çuence evap- orative heat dissipation from the wearer‚Äôs head: the textile material and thickness of the padding are critical factors that determine the effectiveness of evaporative heat dissipation.  evaporative heat  as  The Ô¨Åndings reported here have been obtained through labo- ratory experiments using a sweating manikin, hence, currently it remains unclear if qualitatively similar results can be expected in other conditions, e.g., in the presence of radiant heat with different intensities and angles, and/or with the presence of wind, and how these results relate to comfort perception and possibly heat strain of athletes. Hence, these questions would need to be considered in future research and then through Ô¨Åeld trials involving cricket players. Such tests should be carried out in a range of realistic conditions to complement these reference studies and hence pro- vide an effective test for thermal and evaporative heat transfer in diverse real world settings.

s0003687013000847,"  Standing and walking require continuous postural control to counteract the destabilizing effects of gravity and self-induced movements of the body. Maintaining balance is more challenging when there are external disturbances from motion of the Ô¨Çoor, such as when standing or walking in a moving train, bus, aircraft or ship. Sudden accelerations or decelerations of a treadmill (Berger et al., 1984) or a moveable platform embedded in a walkway (e.g., Nashner, 1980; Oddsson et al., 2004; Bhatt et al., 2005) have been used to investigate responses to slips, trips, and missteps encoun- tered during walking. Longer duration low frequency oscillations (0.2e0.5 Hz) of a treadmill on a six-axis motion platform (e.g., Brady et al., 2009; McAndrew et al., 2010) have been used to investigate postural responses to perturbations when walking but have not been representative of motions encountered in transport. With instantaneous increases in horizontal acceleration, sta- tionary standing people have been reported to tolerate accelera-  2 in the backward direction, 0.48 ms  2 in the tions up to 0.76 ms  2 in a sideways direction (Jongkees forward direction, and 0.33 ms and Groen, 1942 e as cited by De Graaf and Van Weperen, (1997)). Similar thresholds were obtained by De Graaf and Van Weperen, (1997), who found that standing subjects were most sensitive to  * Corresponding author. E-mail address: M.J.GrifÔ¨Ån@soton.ac.uk (M.J. GrifÔ¨Ån).  lateral acceleration when standing with their feet almost together. Postural stability when standing still and exposed to narrow-band random fore-and-aft and lateral oscillation has been studied at frequencies between 0.125 and 2.0 Hz with velocities from 0.04 to  1 r.m.s. (Nawayseh and GrifÔ¨Ån, 2006). The displacement of 0.16 ms the centre of pressure (COP) and subject estimates of the proba- bility of losing balance increased with increasing magnitude of oscillation and, with the same velocity at all frequencies, stability problems were greatest around 0.5 Hz. Tolerances of walking subjects to sideward oscillations in transport have not been pre- viously reported. Understanding of the physiological and biomechanical aspects of balance has been used to develop active models of postural stability when standing (e.g. Mergner et al., 2006; Peterka, 2003). These models represent the neural, sensory, and biomechanical subsystems involved in human postural control but do not allow the prediction of the probability of falling. People may be expected to be more stable when standing and supported on two legs than when walking and supported on only one leg for 80% of the gait cycle (Woollacott and Tang, 1997), especially when threatened by external perturbations. The main strategy used to maintain balance during locomotion is the stepping strategy (Nashner, 1980; Horak and Nashner, 1986; Hof et al., 2007). Additional strategies (e.g. active hip torque and active ankle subtalar torque) are used for Ô¨Åne tuning (Hof et al., 2007; MacKinnon and Winter, 1993) when the foot position is established.

GrifÔ¨Ån / Applied Ergonomics 45 (2014) 293e299  maintains postural stability in the frontal (i.e., coronal) plane by regulating the trajectory of the centre of mass (COM) (Townsend, 1985) and has a greater inÔ¨Çuence on postural control during un- perturbed walking than either step length or step time (Owings and Grabiner, 2004). It has been suggested that step width is adjusted to compensate for lateral acceleration induced by external perturba- tion (Oddsson et al., 2004). The overall aim of the study reported in this paper was to determine how postural stability when walking is inÔ¨Çuenced by the magnitude and the frequency of lateral oscillation of the Ô¨Çoor. It was hypothesised that, at each frequency of oscillation, the self- reported probability of losing balance and the movement of the centre of pressure in the lateral direction would increase with increasing magnitude of oscillation. It was expected that the movement of the centre of pressure would vary with the frequency of oscillation in a manner that would explain the frequency- dependence of the loss of balance.  2. Method  2.1.  Subjects  Twenty healthy male subjects median age 27 years (range 25e 41), stature 177 cm (range 165e192), weight 72.3 kg (48.5 kge 88.45) participated in the study. Subjects completed a question- naire to exclude those with relevant disorders or using drugs that might affect postural stability. Informed consent was obtained prior to participation in the experiment that was approved by the Human Experimentation Safety and Ethics Committee of the Institute of Sound and Vibration Research.  2.2. Apparatus  A treadmill (Kistler Gaitway√í) incorporating eight force sensors was used to provide the walking task and measure the vertical ground reaction forces during walking. Subjects were secured by a safety harness connected via two loose straps to a frame around the treadmill (Fig. 1). The harness allowed subjects to move freely in the plane of progression but prevented their knees or hips contacting the Ô¨Çoor if they fell. A safety net was positioned behind the subjects as a precaution in case they slid backwards while walking on the treadmill. Lateral oscillatory motion was generated by a six-axis motion simulator in the Human Factors Research Unit at the Institute of  Sound and Vibration Research. The simulator is able to provide translational displacements of 0.5 m in the lateral direction at accelerations up to about 10 ms  2. Acceleration in the lateral direction was recorded by acceler- ometers on the simulator platform (FGP model FA101-A2-5G). Data acquisition via the treadmill software was triggered at the moment the 4¬Ω-cycle acceleration commenced. The acceleration and force data collected by the Gaitway√í data acquisition system were sampled at 100 samples per second and stored in a personal computer.  2.3.  Experimental procedure  While walking on the treadmill, subjects were perturbed by simple transient lateral acceleration stimuli applied at an unpre- dictable time. The stimuli were 4.5 cycles of sinusoidal motion modulated by a half sine envelope. For these waveforms, the peak acceleration and the peak velocity are, respectively, double the r.m.s. acceleration and r.m.s. velocity. The motions start and end with zero displacement, velocity and acceleration and were chosen as being broadly representative of lateral motions experienced in trains (Fig. 2a). At each of seven frequencies (0.5, 0.63, 0.8, 1.0, 1.25, 1.6, 2.0 Hz), the motions were presented at eight velocities (0.032, 0.04, 0.05,  1 r.m.s.). This resulted in accelera- 0.062, 0.08, 0.1, 0.125, 0.16 ms  2 r.m.s. (Fig. 2b). The frequencies and tions in the range 0.1e2.0 ms magnitudes were chosen after preliminary experimentation and so that the effects of stimuli with the same magnitude of acceleration or stimuli with the same magnitude of velocity could be compared across the frequency range. The 56 motions were presented in a random order. The speed of the treadmill was selected so that subjects walked at 0.7 ms throughout the experiment. This was the preferred comfortable walking speed of subjects who participated in pre- liminary experiments. The eight channels of force data were acquired throughout each of the 4¬Ω-cycle perturbations. After experiencing each motion, subjects were asked to judge their postural stability by answering the following question: ‚ÄúWhat is the probability that you would lose balance if the same exposure were repeated?‚Äù Subjects were instructed to Ô¨Åx their vision on the board in front of them (which moved with the lateral motion of the simulator) and to grasp the handrails of the treadmill only if it was really   1  Fig. 1.

Analysis  The raw force time-histories (from 8 force sensors) were pro- cessed to determine the centre of pressure (COP) during each motion. The arrangement of the force sensors in the treadmill is shown in Fig. 3. The COP in the lateral direction was obtained by moment equilibrium of the vertical ground reaction forces gath- ered via eight force sensors with respect to longitudinal axis of the treadmill (x-axis, Fig. 3):  COPy ¬º a√∞F1 √æ F4 √æ F5 √æ F8 √û   a√∞F2 √æ F3 √æ F6 √æ F7 √û  F1 √æ F2 √æ F3 √æ F4 √æ F5 √æ F6 √æ F7 √æ F8  Where the distance, a, and the forces, F, are deÔ¨Åned in Fig. 3. The COP velocity in the lateral direction was obtained by differentiating the lateral COP position after Ô¨Åltering the centre of pressure position using a low-pass Bessel Ô¨Ålter at 8 Hz. An example of the COP position and COP velocity of a subject  2 r.m.s. exposed to 0.8-Hz lateral oscillation at 0.5 ms is shown in Fig. 4. The mean value has been subtracted from the COP position, which shows the location of the ground reaction forces in the lateral direction (y-axis) and is indicative of lateral foot placement. The COP velocity indicates the rate of change of COP position (Fig. 4b). Non-parametric statistical methods were used for the data analysis using SPSS (version 17).

During unperturbed walking, the median lateral peak-to-peak COP position and r.m.s. COP velocity were 18.42 cm and  1, 35.79 cms respectively. The peak-to-peak lateral COP position during unperturbed walking was less than when walking and perturbed by lateral oscillation at any frequency and magnitude of oscillation (p < 0.05, Wilcoxon), except two conditions with low  1 r.m.s. magnitude lateral oscillation at high frequencies (0.032 ms  1 r.m.s. with 2-Hz oscillation; with 1.6-Hz oscillation, and 0.04 ms p > 0.05, Wilcoxon).

Discussion  With all frequencies of lateral oscillation, as the magnitude of the perturbation increased the perceived risk of fall increased (Fig. 5). The peak-to-peak lateral COP position and the r.m.s. lateral COP velocity also increased with increased magnitude of oscillation (Figs. 8 and 11). The increase in peak-to-peak COP position indicates an increase in step width, which is adjusted to compensate for lateral acceleration induced by external perturbations (e.g., Oddsson et al., 2004; Brady et al., 2009). The increase in lateral r.m.s. COP velocity with increasing magnitude of oscillation in- dicates that subjects used faster stepping to counteract the desta- bilising effects of the lateral oscillation. Random oscillation of a Ô¨Çoor has also been reported to cause wider and faster stepping (McAndrew et al., 2010). With the same acceleration at all frequencies, the stability of stationary standing people perturbed by lateral sinusoidal oscilla- tion is less affected by higher frequencies (e.g. 0.5e2 Hz) than by lower frequencies (e.g. 0.125e0.5 Hz) (Nawayseh and GrifÔ¨Ån, 2006). Over the same frequency range, the current study also found less postural instability (reduced probability of losing balance and reduced peak COP displacement) as the frequency of oscillation increased with constant magnitude of acceleration (Figs. 6a and 9). Stationary standing people perturbed by lateral oscillations with the same velocity showed greatest displacements of the centre of pressure and greatest subjective estimates of the probability of losing balance around 0.5 Hz (Nawayseh and GrifÔ¨Ån, 2006). In the present study, irrespective of the frequency of oscillation, the probability of losing balance in walking subjects was broadly similar when the lateral oscillation was applied at the same r.m.s. velocity (Fig. 6b). The peak COP displacement (i.e., peak-to-peak COP position) decreased with increasing frequency of oscillation but the r.m.s. COP velocity was broadly independent of the fre- quency of oscillation at the same r.m.s. velocity (Fig. 10). The lateral r.m.s. COP velocity may indicate effort to respond to the velocity of external perturbations by adjusting the timing of foot placement. With the same acceleration at all frequencies, there are greater velocities and greater displacements with the lower frequency os- cillations. The results of the present study show these motions cause greater difÔ¨Åculty in adjusting the centre of pressure, pre- sumably because the motions are larger and faster. In response to a movement of the centre of mass, the centre of pressure is adjusted using postural control strategies (Murray et al. 1967; Prieto et al. 1993). Walking people are sensitive to changes in lateral velocity and take corrective stepping actions (Hof, 2008; Hof et al. 2010). The Ô¨Åndings of the present study are consistent with walking people responding to changes in lateral velocity by adjusting their lateral COP velocity.  Stability thresholds have not previously been reported for walking subjects. Arbitrarily, the Ô¨Åndings of this study have been used to calculate the magnitudes required at each frequency of lateral oscillation for 50% of subjects to report at least 50% proba- bility of losing balance (Fig. 7). Subjects standing with their eyes closed and their feet together have been reported to tolerate ‚Äòstep‚Äô lowed by a constant deceleration) up to 0.33 ms changes in lateral acceleration (sudden constant acceleration fol-  2 r.m.s. (Jongkees and Groen, 1942). In the current study, an acceleration of about  2 r.m.s. at about 0.5 Hz resulted in about 50% of subjects 0.3 ms reporting at least 50% probability of losing balance, but a much greater acceleration was required to produce the same effect with the higher frequencies of oscillation (Fig. 5a). A stability threshold of 0.45 ms  2 has been reported for subjects standing with their hands free, heels together, and toes 3e4 cm apart while exposed to sudden acceleration or deceleration without holding handrails, or taking a protective step, or stabilizing the body by large body sways or arm movements (De Graaf and Van Weperen, 1997). In addition to the use of standing as opposed to walking subjects, and some other important details, these previous studies (Jongkees and Groen, 1942; De Graaf and Van Weperen, 1997) differ in respect of the waveform of the motion stimulus. The present results show that the effects of lateral acceleration on postural stability are highly frequency-dependent and cannot be predicted solely from the peak acceleration although, for the waveforms investigated, stability is well predicted by both the peak velocity and the r.m.s. velocity. Dynamic balance during normal locomotion is mainly achieved by adjusting the timing and placement of successive steps (Nashner, 1980). To compensate for medio-lateral acceleration induced by perturbations, it has been suggested that the central nervous system adjusts the step width to alter the moment arm (Oddsson et al., 2004). Although the main strategy for maintaining balance is the ‚Äòstepping strategy‚Äô, large errors in foot placement are corrected by hip moments (Hof et al., 2007; McKinnon and Winter, 1993) and Ô¨Åne tuning is achieved by active ankle moments. The overall effects of the magnitude and frequency of oscillation on lateral COP movement in the present study implies that most of the subjects primarily used stepping strategies to counteract the destabilizing effects of lateral oscillation. There are differences between walking on a treadmill and walking along a Ô¨Çoor. Subjects could not stop walking when their stability was threatened and so, unlike in many forms of transport, remaining stationary for a period of time was not an acceptable response. Otherwise, the biomechanics of walking on a treadmill and walking on a Ô¨Çoor may be similar (Wagenaar and Beek, 2000), although the use of a speed preferred by the subject or the same speed controlled for all subjects has been reported to affect postural responses to perturbations during gait (Duysens and Bloem, 2009).  1 used in the present study was The controlled speed of 0.7 ms judged to be a comfortable walking speed by subjects in pre- liminary experiments but stability may differ with faster or slower speeds. The perceived risk of falling reported in this study may differ from the risk of passengers falling in transport. The subjects were prevented from falling, and so their reported probability of falling was inÔ¨Çuenced by the extent to which they found it necessary to take protective action, rather than by experiencing a fall. The lateral COP displacement and r.m.s. COP velocity may primarily reÔ¨Çect subject effort to continue walking by compensating with a wider or quicker step when motion threatened their stability. Although the subjective and objective measures of postural stability used in this study reÔ¨Çect threats to postural stability, with the same motions in transport the risk of falling may differ for a variety of reasons (e.g., because the attention of passengers may not be focused on  
H.M. Sari, M.J. GrifÔ¨Ån / Applied Ergonomics 45 (2014) 293e299  299  preventing falls and the risk of fall will be greater without a safety harness and handrail). The stability thresholds provided for lateral oscillations that are typical of motions in some trains indicate the dependence of postural stability on the frequency of oscillation and may also provide an indication of the likely effects of motion on the stability of people walking in transport. The present study was conducted with Ô¨Åt young male subjects who volunteered to participate in the study. Large differences in postural stability when walking and exposed to perturbations are expected to be associated with differences in age, gender, balance disorders, Ô¨Åtness, clothing, and carrying. The population partici- pating in the study may be assumed to be among those least affected by motion perturbations: greater problems may be ex- pected with some members of the general public, some of whom may be deterred from travelling by the risk of falling when moving around during travel.  5.  Conclusion  The postural instability caused by low frequency lateral oscil- lations over the frequency range 0.5e2 Hz, typical of those expe- rienced in some forms of transport, cannot be predicted solely from the lateral acceleration. For transient sinusoidal oscillations of the type studied, postural instability may be predicted from the ve- locity of the motion. Movements of the centre of pressure show that subjects attempt to compensate for perturbations by increasing their step width and increasing their step rate.

s0003687013000859,"  Bicycle is a popular and economical mode of human-powered transportation. This also enables it to be used as effective equip- ment towards Ô¨Åtness and rehabilitation (Balasubramanian and Jayaraman, 2009). However, bicycling demands one to bend for- ward while pedaling; this prolonged forward Ô¨Çexion posture may increase the risk of chronic injuries such as musculoskeletal dis- orders (MSD), compression neuropathies, and so on. Hence, proper bicycle design is necessary to reduce MSD and enhance comfort for riders (Laios and Giannatsis, 2010; Mellion, 1994; De Vey Mestdagh, 1998). Cyclists adopt a round-back or Ô¨Çat-back posture to reach the handlebars by Ô¨Çexing their pelvis and spine (Burke, 1996; Usabiaga et al., 1997). Cyclists who maintain a prolonged aerodynamic posture experience pronounced stress on their shoulder, neck and low back pain (Mellion, 1994; Burnett et al., 2004). For example, the working schedule for a bicycle messenger is normally around 40 h per week. This prolonged bicycling demands a very high physical capacity with high energy expenditure which often exceeds the recommended level (mean oxygen uptake (VO2) during an 8 h working day should not exceed 30% of the maximum capacity of oxygen uptake) and subsequently develops fatigue (Bernmark et al., 2006). An individual‚Äôs control over the bicycle depends on his  * Corresponding author. Tel.: √æ91 44 2257 4117, fax: √æ91 44 2257 4732. E-mail addresses: chanakya@iitm.ac.in, chanakya@live.com (V. Balasubramanian).  capability to balance the upper body and the strength of his core muscles. When less energy is spent on balancing the upper body, an individual can spend more energy on powering the bicycle (using the lower body). This is the main reason why cycling training centers are considered important; to improve the efÔ¨Åciency and health of the upper body, especially because of the strength they provide to the lower back muscles which is one of the primary posture section of a cyclist‚Äôs body (Li and Caldwell, 1998). Muscle fatigue is an important feature affecting cycling perfor- mance. It has been reported that muscle fatigue would alter the cycling motion and muscle activation pattern (So et al., 2005). Houtz and Fisher (1959) investigated muscle‚Äôs activity patterns on a stationary bicycle using surface electromyography (sEMG). During a fatiguing contraction, the sEMG amplitude has been established to increase in submaximal contractions (De Luca, 1984; Krogh-Lund and Jorgensen, 1992; Van Dieen et al., 1993; Ferguson et al., 2012). At the same time, there is an increase in the lower frequency components of the sEMG spectrum during sustained contractions. These frequency changes have been used as an indicator of muscle fatigue (De Luca, 1984, 1993). During prolonged bicycling, muscle fatigue results from metabolic changes in the recruited muscle Ô¨Å- bers, causing a decrease in the force-generating capacity of the skeletal muscle (Gibson et al., 2001). Endurance cycling requires prolonged Ô¨Çexed posture, which appears to be one of the main reasons for lower limb and lower body problems (Callaghan, 2005; Hausswirth et al., 2010). Since cycling relies almost entirely on the lower body for propulsion across the terrain in a seated position, numerous cycling studies  0003-6870/$ e see front matter √ì 2013 Elsevier Ltd and The Ergonomics Society.

They were having a wheel diameter of 0.60 m, seat height of 0.85 m, handlebar height of 0.95 m and seat-handlebar distance of 0.60 m. SP bicycle however had a wheel diameter of 0.70 m, seat height of 0.95 m,  have examined mostly the lower extremity muscles (Brown et al., 1996; Gregor et al., 1982). This has not been the case for the ef- fects of upper body orientation on neuromuscular control during cycling (Chapman et al., 2008). Balasubramanian and Jayaraman (2009) investigated sEMG based muscle activity analysis on upper body muscle-groups for aerobic cyclists. The results suggested that there is higher muscle fatigue in low back pain group when compared to their cohorts. Researchers have reported that the low back pain occurs due to cyclist‚Äôs posture on the bicycle (De Vey Mestdagh, 1998). Hence, an appropriate bicycle design is very important to avoid health problems and discomforts associated with cycling (Baker, 2000). The effective progress of studies on cycling over several decades has led to various bicycle designs like sport bicycles, road bicycles and mountain bicycles (Wilson, 2004). Bicycles are designed to meet speciÔ¨Åc needs that are usually associated with cycling efÔ¨Å- ciency, safety and comfort. Each bicycle designer designs different frame sizes and dimensions for seat and handlebar, reÔ¨Çecting the qualities of their brands and satisfying the demands of their users. Some cyclists who suffer from back-pain modify their bicycle design with extra-high handlebars so that they can sit upright, with their backs straight. High handlebars decrease the load on the lower cervical spine and reduce the risk of prolonged neck exten- sion (Kolehmainen et al., 1989). Majority of the bicycle design studies focus on race cycling and the relationship between posture and prevention of injuries caused during long periods of cycling (Berry et al., 2000). There have been fewer investigations on the relationship between posture and the cyclist‚Äôs comfort factor and bicycle design (Laios and Giannatsis, 2010; Christiaans and Bremner, 1998). Hence, there is a need for a comparison of the physiological responses of cyclists riding different bicycle categories. We considered three categories of bi- cycle design, namely:  (1) Rigid frame bicycle (RF): It has a frame with a rigid fork, Ô¨Åxed rear and no suspension. (2) Suspension bicycle (SU): It uses linkages to attach the rear tri- angle to the rear shock for a progressive spring rate. It has a (racing) drop handlebar, narrow tyres and no suspension.  (3) Sports bicycle (SP):  The main objective of the study was to evaluate bicycle design using sEMG, by examining whether differences in muscle activity existed in cyclists whilst performing a continuous ride on RF, SU and SP bicycle designs.  2.

Many researchers simply take this general deÔ¨Ånition and perform studies using Ô¨Ådelity as an inde- pendent variable (Catani and Biers, 1998; Sefelin et al., 2003). Even with a common general deÔ¨Ånition of Ô¨Ådelity, these studies have demonstrated vastly different interpretations of the deÔ¨Ånition and, therefore, have resulted in different outcomes. Sauer et al. (2010) acknowledge these inconsistencies and propose a four-factor framework of contextual Ô¨Ådelity which asserts that the deÔ¨Ånition of Ô¨Ådelity is too narrow. They expand the deÔ¨Ånition to include the Ô¨Ådelity of the testing environment, user characteristics, and task scenarios along with the currently accepted system prototype. Their assumption is that research results are varied because these results are not considering every important factor. Virzi et al. (1996) also address the poor deÔ¨Ånition of Ô¨Ådelity but believe Ô¨Ådelity can be broken into separate parts, and explain that Ô¨Ådelity is composed of multiple components or dimensions. These dimensions include breadth of features, degree of functionality, similarity of interaction, and aesthetic reÔ¨Ånement. Breadth of features describes the number of Ô¨Ånal system functions a prototype has. Degree of functionality  describes how functional each Ô¨Ånal system function is in a proto- type. Similarity of interaction describes how similar a user‚Äôs inter- action with the prototype is to his or her interaction with the Ô¨Ånal system. Aesthetic reÔ¨Ånement describes how similar a prototype looks compared to the Ô¨Ånal design. Table 1 shows how a number of studies that have been designed to test the effects of variations in Ô¨Ådelity have often varied Ô¨Ådelity by changing different, and some- times multiple, components within a single study. The simultaneous variation of multiple components of Ô¨Ådelity shown in Table 1 make it clear why the results of these studies have often been split, with some saying Ô¨Ådelity has no impact on us- ability testing and others saying just the opposite. Therefore, the appropriate method for testing the effects of Ô¨Ådelity is testing each of its components as separate variables rather than grouping them together under the umbrella of general Ô¨Ådelity. Walker et al. (2002) support this conclusion, agreeing that Ô¨Ådelity should be separated into components for experimentation, but they divide Ô¨Ådelity differently than Virzi et al. (1996) do by identifying interface me- dium (e.g. computer, paper, etc.) as one of the separate compo- nents. While a change in interface medium could simultaneously change multiple components of Ô¨Ådelity as deÔ¨Åned by Virzi et al. (1996), Walker et al. (2002), either intentionally or by chance, avoided these impacts in their study and only affected the degree of functionality of the interface.  1.2.

However, the opposite is not necessarily true. An interface‚Äôs overall Ô¨Ådelity may be increased or decreased without actually changing the interface medium. For example, an interface can lose overall Ô¨Ådelity by no longer having interactive buttons but still be presented using the same medium (e.g. a computer). The research authored by Walker et al. (2002) most inspired this study. The idea behind their research is that in order to evaluate Ô¨Ådelity, it must Ô¨Årst be broken down into components. In their case, the component that was studied was interface medium or degree of functionality. The challenge in studying the effects of interface mediums is keeping all Ô¨Ådelity components consistent (except the one being tested) across each medium. For the Walker et al. (2002) experiment, this involved keeping the breadth of features, simi- larity of interaction, and aesthetic reÔ¨Ånement stable while testing the degree of functionality as an independent variable. While Walker et al. (2002) found no signiÔ¨Åcant impact in the number, type, or severity of usability issues discovered by the users due to interface medium, there is a shadow cast on the results because of the small number of participants tested. And while Virzi et al. (1996) found no effect from variation in interface medium, the systems in their experimentations are somewhat outdated today, and a similar methodology applied to more modern technology could prove valuable. Furthermore, more research is needed before the usefulness of low-Ô¨Ådelity prototypes can be fully evaluated (Sauer et al., 2010).  1.3. Hypotheses  A review of current literature led to the following question: how do reduced Ô¨Ådelity interface mediums affect a user‚Äôs ability to detect usability problems? With this question, four hypotheses were formed:  1. Users are equally likely to detect usability problems using either computer or paper mediums to test a prototype. 2. Users are equally likely to detect severe usability problems using either computer or paper mediums to test a prototype. 3. Users‚Äô perceptions of applications‚Äô usability is unaffected by using either computer or paper mediums to test a prototype. 4. The fewer usability problems a user detects, the higher the user‚Äôs perception of the application‚Äôs usability will be. As users‚Äô perceptions of applications‚Äô usability increases, they are less likely to detect usability problems.  2. "
s0003687013000884,"  The World Wide Web (WWW) has dramatically changed the way consumers buy goods and services, collect information to compare products, and companies conduct their business. Con- sumers can choose among several websites when surf the net, and henceforth websites compete to grasp their attention and receive visits in the future. Recent statistics indicate that although there is a growing number of people that use the WWW to search for product information, to do price comparisons, and to collect useful infor- mation in order to make their purchasing decision, the number of actual online purchases remains still relatively small (Moe and Fader, 2004). Findings from a research carried on by IPSOS Belgium in 2006 (IPSOS, 2008a,b) showed that a not negligible percentage (38%) of consumers did not buy online as they found it difÔ¨Åcult to make a choice among a great range of available products, features and parameters. Poor website design can be a major factor that negatively affects the consumer purchasing decisions and, as a consequence, the proÔ¨Åtability of ecommerce businesses and re- tailers may be losing a large percentage of potential sales simply  * Tel.: √æ39 081 768 2932; fax: √æ39 081 768 2154. E-mail address: corrado.lostorto@unina.it.  because their websites are confusing and difÔ¨Åcult to use (Lais, 2002; Nielsen, 2001). Several scholars found that website charac- teristics may affect the perception of the website quality developed by the users, and, as a consequence, their purchasing behavior and decision outcome (Dholakia and Rego, 1998; Ho and Wu, 1999; Jarvenpaa and Todd, 1997; Ranganathan and Ganapathy, 2002; WolÔ¨Ånbarger and Gilly, 2002). Good or improved website design may even enhance credibility of information content, supporting e for instance e navigation of anxious users who are more suscep- tible to deception (Singh and Iding, 2011). Thus, for those busi- nesses that use the WWW as a marketing channel it is crucial to assess the appreciation rate for their website either against the competitors‚Äô websites or more conventional marketing tools and channels, and to determine what makes a consumer satisÔ¨Åed with the website, as well as what might be potential causes of dissatis- faction (Djamasbi et al., 2010). In the literature, several methods and approaches to website evaluation have been proposed. They differ as to the goal of the evaluation (usability measurement, website effectiveness evalua- tion, interface features deÔ¨Ånition, website quality assessment), how information and data useful for the evaluation are collected (ob- servations and log activity, heuristics, focus groups, questionnaires, brainstorming, website features enumeration, cognitive walk-  0003-6870/$ e see front matter √ì 2013 Elsevier Ltd and The Ergonomics Society.

C.  lo Storto / Applied Ergonomics 44 (2013) 1004e1014  1005  through and the user testing), and type and nature of information collected (navigation, website content, customer behavior, search- ing mechanisms, website security, technical features) (see, for instance: Bauer and Scharl, 2000; Chen and Macredie, 2005; Cox and Dale, 2002; Cunliffe, 2000; Day, 1997; Grandon and Ranganathan, 2001; Jordan, 1998; Koufaris et al., 2002; Magoutas et al., 2010; Mich et al., 2003; Nielsen, 1995; Nielsen and Loranger, 2006; Palmer, 2002). In particular, scholars and practi- tioners who focused their efforts on the evaluation of website design quality and usability provided a number of guidelines and criteria for this aim, stressing the importance of usability assess- ment in the study of online purchasing behavior as a measure of website quality and use (Agarwal and Venkatesh, 2002; Nielsen, 2000; Palmer, 2002). But, as some researchers emphasize, even when a website has a low usability, other features, i.e. its visual appeal, may be an important factor that affects the positive judg- ment of the user relative to that website (Djamasbi et al., 2010; Lindgaard et al., 2006; Schenkman and J√∂nsson, 2000). In addition, traditional website usability evaluation privileges the use of qual- itative data, and in general usability approaches are unable to resort to users‚Äô emotions and experiences (Chamorro-Koc et al., 2009). As Hahn and Kauffman (2004) claim, there are a number of issues that make common approaches which are successfully adopted to assess electronic interfaces not very suited for ecommerce website evaluation, and particularly: 1) as websites are continuously rede- signed and updated, costly experts have to be frequently involved in a continuous evaluation process, and 2) users of ecommerce websites may be very heterogeneous customers whose habits, preferences, and attitudes differ. As a consequence, website design has to match the needs of a differentiated population of users and website performance assessment should be conducted involving a variegated sample of them. Although in the last years many scholars have provided frame- works and a number of methods to evaluate ecommerce websites speciÔ¨Åcally (Boyd, 2002; Merwe and Bekker, 2003), generally there is a lack of theoretical justiÔ¨Åcations of the frameworks and evalu- ation criteria they adopt. Moreover, these approaches also neglect or do not effectively model the cognitive process of online con- sumers that determines how they perceive the quality of the websites that are experiencing. Indeed, information processing and cognition are central activities when consumers interact with websites (Zhang and von Dran, 2000). This paper presents an integrative framework inspired by con- cepts driven from various theories of cognition and information processing e i.e., cognitive load, distributed cognition, cognitive Ô¨Åt, and media richness (Clark and Chalmers, 1998; Daft and Lengel, 1986; Hutchins, 1995a,b; Lave, 1988; Rogers and Ellis, 1994; Ramarapu et al., 1997; Vessey, 1991) that helps to assess and compare ecommerce websites. This framework adopts the concept of cognitive efÔ¨Åciency as a measurement of the website quality and performance, measured by the ratio of user perceived cognitive beneÔ¨Åts to cognitive costs. Further, it uses Data Envelopment Analysis to calculate the website cognitive efÔ¨Åciency score. The framework is implemented to compare 52 ecommerce websites of businesses selling goods in the information technology and media market (PC equipment, music CDs, DVDs, books). A stepwise regression analysis is performed to identify cognitive costs and beneÔ¨Åts that mostly affect website cognitive efÔ¨Åciency. The paper has the following structure. Firstly, information processing and cognition issues related to the website usage are discussed. Sec- ondly, the userewebsite interaction cognitive efÔ¨Åciency is pre- sented. Thirdly, the sources of cognitive costs and beneÔ¨Åts are analyzed. Next, the methodology for the measurement of the website cognitive efÔ¨Åciency and implementation of the framework are illustrated. Finally, results are reported and discussed.  2.  The website evaluation framework  2.1.  Information processing and cognition of website users  Ecommerce websites, acting as decision support systems, allow the consumers to perform problem-solving and decision-making more efÔ¨Åciently along the stages of online purchasing, providing them with an aid capable to reduce their cognitive effort and in- crease their information processing and cognitive ability (Helander and Khalid, 2000). The interaction occurring between the user and the website forms a unique coupled cognitive system in which the website, providing the user with patterns of action and an additive short-memory, supports this latter by keeping the internal mental information processing activity less complex (Clark and Chalmers, 1998; Halverson, 1994). In such a way, the external resources (i.e., personal notes, paper catalogs, webpages, etc.) become a part of the user cognitive system (Edmondson and Beale, 2008).1 The repre- sentations of information and knowledge by means of a website interface have a number of properties that may greatly affect the users cognitive effort when they perform their task on the WWW (Carroll, 1987; Wright et al., 2000; Zhang, 1991):   Ô¨Årstly, as underlined, they can provide memory aids, and because information resides in front of the user, that has not to be remembered. The website supports cognition not just passively by merely representing itself, but actively by regis- tering and storing user activities for future use, and thus functioning like an external memory (Clark, 1997; Kirsh, 1996; Kirsch and Maglio, 1994). When the user surfs the WWW, the browser e as an external representation e can advise if a page has already been visited, remembering which page the user has already visited and which has not yet. For instance, links to pages that have not been seen by the user are blue, while links to previously seen pages appear purple or red. Henceforth, when the user interacts with the website interface, information and knowledge are continuously transformed through mental, external and technological representational states, and in terms of distributed cognition achievements are characterized as the assembling of various representational states (Staggers and Norcio, 1993; Zhang and Norman, 1994);  secondly, they can anchor and structure the user cognitive behavior, because physical structures in the external repre- sentations constrain the range of possible cognitive behaviors, allowing some of them and prohibiting others. The website indeed provides Ô¨Åltering devices and structures to represent and store information and knowledge through the use of symbols, constraints and working rules which are comple- mentary to the user‚Äôs ones (see Table 1);  thirdly, they change the nature of task, making its performance easier by simplifying the problem and reducing the user in- formation load. To a certain extent, the website addresses how user cognition evolves during interaction as the website dynamically assumes new conÔ¨Ågurations that better Ô¨Åt the user information processing capability;  fourthly, technology makes website interfaces very Ô¨Çexible decision support systems. Hence, by removing or adding different features and functions such as text, audio, colors, interactivity, customization, etc., websites may assume several  1  That is consistent with the view of cognition as a distributed phenomenon between individuals and artifacts used to perform a task (e.g., paper notes, docu- ments, more or less complex technological devices, electronic interfaces, etc.) (Flor and Hutchins, 1992; Hutchins, 1995b; Hutchins and Klausen, 1996; Rogers, 2004; Suchman, 1987).

For instance, easily identiÔ¨Åable and meaningful icons on a website page may reduce perceived complexity and support the user navigation unequivocally (Cheng and Patterson, 2007).  2.2. The website cognitive efÔ¨Åciency in the userewebsite interaction  As human short-term working memory capacity is limited, a website should be capable to eliminate or reduce the working memory overload associated to the need to mentally retain and integrate several pieces of information and knowledge, but, at the same time, to provide the user with a pleasant and satisfying experience (Sweller, 1994). Cognitive efÔ¨Åciency, then, may be an effective measure of how much cognitive work the users have to perform outside of their working memory in a given task, given the constraining nature of the website interfaces. The theories of cognitive efÔ¨Åciency suggest that, when the user cognitive tasks can be performed easily and quickly, the cognitive effort can be mini- mized and the search performance and the user gratiÔ¨Åcation can be maximized. If information is almost processed automatically with the support of the website, the user cognitive efÔ¨Åciency may sub- stantially increase. Thus, better websites allow the user to have a greater cognitive efÔ¨Åciency during interaction. Following this dis- cussion, an efÔ¨Åciency index can be constructed, by considering the ratio of the user perceived cognitive beneÔ¨Åts to cognitive costs incurred during the interaction with the website:  P P  efficiency ¬º  cognitive benefits  cognitive costs  (1)  bewilderment, causing the search activity to become psycholog- ically and cognitively costly (Chevalier and Kicka, 2006; Sweller, 1988, 1994; Wilkie, 1994). The amount of ambiguity and uncer- tainty perceived by the user is a measure of the cognitive costs to bear when using the website.2 Literature suggests that individuals perceive and process uncertain and ambiguous information differ- ently, depending on their cognitive capabilities, past experience, and attitudes (Gris√© and Gallupe, 2000; Kuhlthau and Tama, 2001; Tversky, 1972), as their cognitive and learning style works as a sort of internal mechanism Ô¨Åltering or activating their cognitive capabil- ities (Anderson, 2006). In the distributed cognition view, the perceived uncertainty and ambiguity are not only related to the type of task to be accomplished using the website or to the user infor- mation processing capabilities, but also to the website features themselves. Poor website design requests to the user a greater attention to grasp the logic and the way the website works. Vice versa, a well designed website interface may simplify the access to information and reduce both ambiguity and uncertainty. Time needed to search for information also affects the amount of cogni- tive cost the user has to bear in the interaction with the website. The more the user has to think about how to use the website interface, the less a sufÔ¨Åcient amount of cognitive and perceptual resources will be available to perform the main task. Time perception is thus associated to mental workload (Baldauf et al., 2009). A lower amount of time consumed to achieve a task is usually associated to more efÔ¨Åcient information processing and effective website design (Hong et al., 2004). When the website includes both highlighted and non-highlighted options or differently colored options, the search time for collecting useful information depends both on the time necessary to Ô¨Ånd the target when there is a highlighted option and the time necessary to Ô¨Ånd the target when there is no highlighted option or this option is differently colored (Crosby et al., 2003). Search time for information is strongly related to website features, i.e. the density and visual complexity of the background (Drury et al., 1978; Tuch et al., 2009). Moreover, a low speed at which website pages load and commands are carried out contributes to make the user frustrated when the website is used. However, it may happen that when the interaction with the website is really enjoyable, the user becomes so engaged in this interaction, so full immersed in what is doing and focused on the task to be totally unaware of the time which is passing. In this case, the perception that the user has of time becomes distorted, and an objective measure of it might not be associated to the real cognitive cost sustained. Even, much more time to complete the task can be spent, if the interaction with the website is pleasing and the satisÔ¨Åed website user has fallen in a state of Ô¨Çow (Hoffman et al., 2000; Hoffman et al., 2002). Thus, an objective measurement of time may be even misleading in the assessment of website quality. Interacting with the website interface is for the user also a source of gratiÔ¨Åcation and satisfaction, which are associated both to the quality of interaction itself and the way it develops, and the suc- cessful goal attainment. Online shopping is intrinsically more un- certain and risky than conventional shopping for the consumer,  2.3.  Sources of cognitive costs and beneÔ¨Åts  During the interaction with the website, the user has to bear a cognitive cost because of the efforts made to search, interpret and process information (Suchman, 1987). If the website user is either unable to locate critical information or to manage the information overload, and feels disoriented because information already collected is either redundant or ambiguous, proceeding with this search and retrieving supplementary information necessary to accomplish the task will be difÔ¨Åcult (Germanprez and Zigurs, 2003). That will increase the user perception of task complexity and  2  Literature differentiates these two cognitive states of individuals. In particular, uncertainty is a consequence of the perceived lack of information (Daft and Lengel, 1986; Galbraith, 1973). This lack of information increases with task complexity, i.e. the variety of its constituting actions and their interrelationships. When a great number of actions have to be executed, it is not easy to deÔ¨Åne accurately all the details before starting task execution, and new information has to be acquired during interaction as unexpected events produce a gap in the knowledge. On the other side, ambiguity emerges when there might be several different in- terpretations, even contrasting, of a certain situation (Daft and Weick, 1984). When either tasks or actions cannot be correctly framed, their execution cannot be easily planned and has ambiguous aspects.  
C.  lo Storto / Applied Ergonomics 44 (2013) 1004e1014  1007  because of the inability to check the product or service quality before buying and receiving it at home, or to Ô¨Ånd enough infor- mation about the seller, or monitor the safety of sending personal and Ô¨Ånancial information. Further, it provides the consumer with a different experience from shopping in a physical retail store, and as the web store is unable to reproduce the environment and the at- mosphere of a physical retailer due to the technical limitations of the electronic interface, the website design has to compensate for the loss of them (East, 1997; Engel et al., 1995). Thus, the users will generally be more attracted by websites that make them at ease, nourishing their trust. Scholars found that the positive experience during online shopping is an important determinant of retaining online consumers (Rice, 1997), and the quality of a retailing website is a dominant antecedent of the user satisfaction within the online shopping environment (WolÔ¨Ånbarger and Gilly, 2002). Cs√≠kszentmih√°lyi (1990) uses the concept of ‚Äústates of optimal experience‚Äù or ‚ÄúÔ¨Çow‚Äù to refer to a cognitive state of the user which is characterized as being intrinsically enjoyable, accompanied by a loss of self-consciousness, and self-reinforcing.3 Vellido et al. (2000) found that the easiness of use of the online store website and the perceived control over it by the user are major determinants of user satisfaction that explain purchasing on the web. As empirical studies reveal (Cs√≠kszentmih√°lyi, 1990; Hoffman et al., 2000), a state of Ô¨Çow is generally associated to a good balance between how much the users perceive that the interaction with the website is challenging and to what extent their skills match the websites complexity. This means that an interaction with a website which is apparently extremely easy-to-use might be as frustrating as the interaction with an ambiguous or technically deÔ¨Åcient website. That is a major concern that should be taken into account when using conventional approaches to the assessment of website usability.  3.  The implementation of the framework  3.1.  The website cognitive efÔ¨Åciency measurement  The measurement of the cognitive efÔ¨Åciency of a website im- plies the development of a complex model that relates a set of input and output variables associated to measurements of the user perceived cognitive costs and beneÔ¨Åts. For this aim, scholars have suggested the implementation of Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA), a mathematical non parametric multi-criteria technique based on a seminal idea proposed by Farrell (1957) that provides a measure of the relative efÔ¨Åciency of a number of units based on a not necessarily known or pre-deÔ¨Åned conversion process of inputs into outputs (Charnes et al., 1978). Particularly, DEA adopts linear programming to identify a production frontier as locus of efÔ¨Åcient units. In the original formulation by Charnes et al. (1978) (CCR model), units which are placed on the production frontier are 100% efÔ¨Åcient, while units that are displaced away from the frontier are considered not efÔ¨Åcient. If a unit is less than 100% efÔ¨Åcient, a linear combination of other units yields the same level of outputs consuming a lower amount of inputs which is actually used by that unit. This technique allows to avoid some of the critical assump- tions made to measure efÔ¨Åciency, assessing the relative efÔ¨Åciency of units without the need to introduce any a priori minimal assumption relatively to the functional relationships between input and output factors in these units to build the efÔ¨Åciency frontier. As  3  In the WWW context the Ô¨Çow describes an online experience where the users are completely engaged with their online interaction with the website, judging it intrinsically interesting to the extent that they often perceive a sense of control over the website interaction, losing track of time passing and of the immediate physical surroundings (Hoffman et al., 2002; Trevino and Webster, 1992; Webster et al., 1993).  the standard development of the DEA model produces an efÔ¨Åciency measure which is between 0 and 1, and does not generate a ranking of units, Andersen and Petersen (1993) e modifying the original CCR model e introduced the concept of super-efÔ¨Åciency that makes the efÔ¨Åciency analysis more discerning and provides a full not censored ranking of unit efÔ¨Åciency (Lovell and Rouse, 2003; Zhu, 1996). Details relative to how DEA works and the re-formulated model measuring super-efÔ¨Åciency are illustrated in the Appendix.  3.2.  The input and output variables  Alpar et al. (2001) propose a productivity model for websites comparison treating page views as output, and webpages, scripts, and some web constructs as inputs. Alpar and Donthu (2007) conceptualize shopping websites as a computer information sys- tem and sales channel. Data measuring input and output variables in their model are collected from three different sources: site analysis by means of a webcrawler, website visiting statistics retrieved by a market research company, and the measurement of visitor‚Äôs perceptions. Hahn and Kauffman (2004) also provide a conceptualization of a website as a production function that transforms inputs (functions) into outputs (purchase transactions). Adopting this model, they evaluate one single ecommerce website. Rather than benchmarking different websites, the scholars compare completed purchase transactions performed by a great number of customers that use the same ecommerce website. In their DEA model, inputs consist of customers use of a set of website functions, while the only output is the product type basket at checkout. Finally, Benslimane and Yang (2006) implemented DEA to identify the minimum function set that generates the maximum value for buyers that use commercial websites for electronic pro- curement. Particularly, they consider four website functions (identiÔ¨Åcation, selection, execution, and post sale support) as in- puts, and three dimensions of website commercial value (useful- ness, reduced research and processing cost) as outputs. Literature on website usability has suggested three macro-dimensions (or areas) useful for measuring performance of a website (Jordan, 1998; Nielsen, 1995, 2000; Nielsen and Loranger, 2006): user experience, website navigability and structure. These dimensions are used in the proposed framework to measure the user cognitive beneÔ¨Åts and costs (see Fig. 1). Particularly, the ‚Äúexperience‚Äù dimension includes those cognitive beneÔ¨Åts that a user receives in terms of perceived satisfaction (S), usefulness (US) and attractiveness (AT) for the use of the website. The remaining two dimensions, ‚Äúnavigability‚Äù and ‚Äústructure‚Äù are related to website characteristics that can originate cognitive costs for the user along the interaction with it. These characteristics can generate ambiguity (A) and uncertainty (U), and determine an over-consumption of time (T) in the search for useful information.  - ambiguity (A) - uncertainty (U) - time (T)  navigability  - ambiguity (A) - uncertainty (U) - time (T)  structure  Utente  - usefulness (US) - satisfaction (S) - attractiveness (AT)  experience  Fig. 1.

The sample  The framework is implemented to compare 52 websites of businesses that sell their products online (PC equipment, music CDroms, DVDs, books). Literature emphasizes how e generally e usability cannot be conceptualized independently of the context where it should be assessed, but its deÔ¨Ånition and implementability are dependent both on the speciÔ¨Åc goals and tasks that can be performed by means of the website and on the website user target (Lecerof and Paterno, 1998). Scholars also found that the user perception of website easiness of use and control of userewebsite interface interaction vary with the kind of task that has to be accomplished (Guriting and Ndubisi, 2006; Laforet and Li, 2005). Henceforth, in the preparatory stage of the study, a particular attention was paid to deÔ¨Åne and circumscribe a speciÔ¨Åc task and sample of users. Consistently with the tradition and methods of usability research suggesting that website assessment is performed through an intense user involve- ment, the evaluation framework was implemented in an experi- mental setting according to the following steps:  a) customization of the questionnaire to collect judgments rela- tive to the 52 websites of the sample.4 The original question- naire was designed and tested in a previous study by the author (lo Storto, 2004a,b). The questionnaire was designed to mea- sure all the nine variables of the framework that provide proxy measurements of the user cognitive beneÔ¨Åts and costs (i.e., the cognitive cost induced by a sense of ambiguity during website navigation, the cognitive cost induced by the website structure, the cognitive cost associated to the perception of time passing to navigate in search of useful information, the experience linked to website attractiveness, etc.). Constructs measuring the framework variables were built using a list of statements, adopting scales reported in the literature and already tested (see lo Storto, 2004a,b). The users were requested to express their agreement/disagreement for the statement content using a 9 level measurement grid. After Ô¨Ålling in questionnaires, the reliability of scales was measured both by calculating the Cronbach a index and performing a factorial analysis.5 Values were acceptable and consistent with previous studies (lo Storto, 2004a,b) (see Table 2). The Ô¨Årst section of the ques- tionnaire included a scale to classify the cognitive and learning style of the user.6 This scale adopted the PLSI (Paragon  4 The number of websites in the sample is consistent with the sum of input and output variables. Andersen and Petersen (1993) underline that, unless the sum of the input and output variables is small relatively to the number of units, DEA implementation provides generally a large number of units as 100% efÔ¨Åcient. Further, input and output variables are usually highly correlated with one another. Thus, the greater the number of input and output variables, the less discerning the analysis (Jenkins and Murray, 2003). 5 At this stage sample used to check scale reliability included 84 questionnaires. 6 Taking into account the inÔ¨Çuence of the cognitive and learning style of website users is of paramount importance to design successful websites. Indeed, scholars claim that information processing capabilities are inÔ¨Çuenced by personal charac- teristics of the consumers (McGuire, 1976), by their past experience (Tversky, 1972), and cognitive ability (Gris√© and Gallupe, 2000). Newell and Simon (1972) suggest that every individual processes information in a unique way, showing a different capability to do that. Jones et al. (1998) found that males and females react differ- ently to images, while Meyers-Levy and Maheswaran (1991) point out that males focus their attention on a more limited number of issues when process information. Similar Ô¨Åndings emerged in eye-tracking experiments (Lorigo et al., 2006).  b)  c)  d)  Educational Consulting Student Learning Style Inventory) model developed by Shindler (1992) and is based on the Kolb (1984), Jung (1971), and Myers-Briggs and McCaulley (1992) frameworks.7 Information relative to the cognitive and learning style of students who were involved in the study as website users was therefore used to select a reduced number of website evaluators to preserve a high degree of homogeneity; in the front page, the questionnaire also requested the user to provide information relative to the technology adopted (i.e., speed of connection, PC motherboard chip frequency, etc.), the evaluation process (i.e., amount of time dedicated to the website assessment, number of steps in which the process was fragmented, etc). This information was utilized to pick up questionnaires that made the sample used to implement DEA more homogeneous assuring a high internal validity; the questionnaire was administered to a sample of 135 com- puter science engineering, biomedical engineering and auto- mation engineering undergraduate students at the beginning of the term, providing them with all information relative to the aim of the study and questionnaire Ô¨Ålling, inviting them to return it no later than 4 weeks. Each student was requested to assess all 52 websites of the sample and Ô¨Ålling in the Ô¨Årst section of the questionnaire that contained the PLSI scale. Participants were also informed that they had to assess web- sites features rather than their content. At the due date, slightly more than 30% of questionnaires had been Ô¨Ålled in. After soliciting the return of the questionnaires, new questionnaires were Ô¨Ålled in the next 4 weeks. The Ô¨Ånal amount of ques- tionnaires available for the study after 8 weeks was 92 units. However, at this step 8 questionnaires were rejected because they had several unÔ¨Ålled scales and, as a consequence, were not acceptable for the study; in the next step, the 84 questionnaires were classiÔ¨Åed and clustered according to the student cognitive and learning style. Eleven questionnaires were excluded from the analysis as they had been Ô¨Ålled in by means of technologies and an assessment process that were not compatible with the rest of the sample (i.e., the user had a slow connection speed modem or the questionnaire was Ô¨Ålled in fragmenting the evaluation of websites into an exaggerated number of steps). Furthermore, because it was not possible to have a univocal identiÔ¨Åcation of the cognitive and learning style of the user for 22 question- naires, they were discarded and not considered for the next step of the study. The Ô¨Ånal sample that was used in the next steps includes 51 questionnaires. Fig. 2 reports the outcome of questionnaire grouping according to cognitive and learning style. As it shows, the cognitive and learning style labeled as ‚ÄúESFJ‚Äù includes the largest number of questionnaires. From this group, 5 questionnaires associated to 5 students were randomly chosen and used in the calculation of website cognitive efÔ¨Åciency and comparison. The ESFJs are particularly interesting as a reference group for the test of the framework, both for its large diffusion in the population e it is the second most common type, close to 12% e and the cognitive charac- teristics of these users. The ESFJs are generally uncomfortable with uncertain and ambiguous contexts, but enjoy routine and working methodically with an attention to procedures and speciÔ¨Åcations, focusing on details rather than the overall  7  The scale of the Shindler model includes 48 statements.

Data in Table 4 indicate that 48 websites result relatively inefÔ¨Åcient. EfÔ¨Åciency evaluation provided by the CCR DEA model shows the inefÔ¨Åciency score of a website and its reference set, i.e. the set of efÔ¨Åcient websites that generate the virtual website on the frontier used as a benchmark. But, it does not provide any ranking among all web- sites. Therefore, for instance, from this analysis it can be inferred that the website is inefÔ¨Åcient at 78.94% compared to the website primestore which is its reference set, while the website strabilia is inefÔ¨Åcient at 39.11% compared to a virtual website that combine together the websites ebest and primestore which are in its reference set. The website strabilia should therefore reduce the cognitive cost suffered by the user approximately by 60% without reducing the perceived cognitive beneÔ¨Åts to increase its efÔ¨Åciency score. Table 4 reports the website superefÔ¨Åciency scores for web- sites resulted 100% efÔ¨Åcient in the CCR DEA model, too. Table 5 presents major statistics relative to input and output variables of the DEA model, and to efÔ¨Åciency and superefÔ¨Åciency scores. EfÔ¨Åciency measurements are in the range 25.22e100%, while superefÔ¨Åciency ranges from 25.22% to 127.29%. These Ô¨Ånd- ings point out that the sample websites largely differ as to their efÔ¨Åciency rate (std.dev. is 21.40%), and a small number of websites are really cognitively 100% efÔ¨Åcient. Average CCR efÔ¨Åciency is indeed only 63.52%. InefÔ¨Åcient websites over-utilize speciÔ¨Åc inputs (e.g., force the users to make a greater cognitive effort during navigation) or under-produce outputs (e.g., provide the users with a scarce grat- iÔ¨Åcation when they use the websites). The performance of an inefÔ¨Åcient website might be improved either by increasing the user cognitive beneÔ¨Åts or by decreasing cognitive costs when it is used. The extent to which cognitive costs should be reduced to make the website cognitively efÔ¨Åcient for the user can be indicated by a percentage. The extent to which cognitive beneÔ¨Åts have to be increased to move the website to the efÔ¨Åciency frontier can be measured by a percentage, too. Table 6 reports statistics showing relative reduction of cognitive costs or increase of beneÔ¨Åts that would be necessary to make inefÔ¨Åcient websites 100% efÔ¨Åcient according to the input-oriented CCR DEA model. In particular, the column ‚ÄúMean‚Äù in this table displays the average relative amount of potential improvements, while the following two columns ‚ÄúMin‚Äù and ‚ÄúMax‚Äù respectively indicate the smallest and the greatest im- provements necessary to increase the efÔ¨Åciency score of a website to 100%. Henceforth, this table shows potential improvements of  Fig. 2. Cognitive and learning styles identiÔ¨Åed.  e)  unstructured  picture. They are often unable to deal with problems without the support of others; for every scale, judgments given by the 5 selected students were averaged obtaining a unique evaluation. These values were used to run DEA. The DEA technique implemented in the study has adopted a radial measure for efÔ¨Åciency and an input orientation (cognitive costs), in order to get a quantiÔ¨Åcation of the input reduction necessary to make a not efÔ¨Åcient website 100% efÔ¨Åcient keeping the same output value (the cognitive beneÔ¨Åts) (Charnes et al., 1978). It was assumed that scale effects are not inÔ¨Çuential in the study, and henceforth the CCR DEA model was implemented. In order to have a ranking for the 100% efÔ¨Åciency websites too, the re-formulated CCR model was implemented to calculate super-efÔ¨Åciency measures.8 Finally, a stepwise backward regression analysis was performed to Ô¨Ånd cognitive costs and beneÔ¨Åts that mostly affect website efÔ¨Åciency.  4. Results  Table 2 displays the values for the Cronbach a index calculated for measuring the internal reliability of scales used to measure the cognitive variables of the framework. The a value is always greater than 0.70. This threshold measure is considered acceptable to use the measurement scale without the risk to have a scarce internal consistency. The table also reports information relative to scale size in terms of number of items.9 Table 3 shows Pearson correlations between variables. As ex- pected, the cognitive dimensions of the framework associated both to the user cognitive costs perceived during website navigation and to the cognitive costs induced by the website structure are nega- tively correlated to the cognitive dimensions (beneÔ¨Åts) relative to user experience. Moreover, correlations between the cognitive cost dimensions have positive sign and are strong, particularly for am- biguity and uncertainty, indicating that these sources of cognitive cost inÔ¨Çuence each other. These Ô¨Åndings are conÔ¨Årming the logical consistency of the framework developed. Correlations between variables that measure speciÔ¨Åc aspects of the user experience in the interaction with the website are also very strong and positive. Table 4 summarizes the outcome of DEA. According to the CCR model, websites considered inefÔ¨Åcient have an efÔ¨Åciency measure lower than 100%. A website is inefÔ¨Åcient if a virtual website can be generated as a linear combination of some websites in the sample,  8  For not efÔ¨Åcient websites, efÔ¨Åciency and super-efÔ¨Åciency have the same value (Andersen and Petersen, 1993).  9  The indications provided by the Cronbach a calculation are consistent with the factor analysis outcome. For the sake of brevity, the results have not been included.

As expected, consequently to the adoption of an input-oriented DEA model, the reduction of cogni- tive costs weighs more than the increase of beneÔ¨Åts and appears more critical to achieve efÔ¨Åciency. On average, a cognitive cost reduction higher than 40% is necessary to make efÔ¨Åcient a website belonging to sample which is not 100% efÔ¨Åcient. In particular, the navigability macro-dimension of the website seems even more critical as the minimum relative improvement required to make a website efÔ¨Åcient is not less than about 10% (%TIME_NAV), unlike the structure macro-dimension. For this latter, improvement needed is close to 5% (%AMB_STRU) to reduce the amount of perceived am- biguity and about 1% the amount of cognitive effort linked to perceived high time and uncertainty. In theory, this means that e in the best case (i.e., the virtual best inefÔ¨Åcient website) e it is more expedient for the web designer to improve the website perceived cognitive beneÔ¨Åts to costs ratio by focusing on the website struc- ture rather than on navigability, as a greater effort is necessary for this latter. The cognitive cost due to arising of ambiguity during website navigation is particularly great. The minimum improve- ment required for achieving full efÔ¨Åciency remains greater than the improvement needed to reduce uncertainty and time consumption. As to cognitive beneÔ¨Åts, unlike cognitive costs, differences between their improvement rates are more evident. The average improve- ment for website usefulness needed to make a website efÔ¨Åcient is rather irrelevant (only 1.79%), while the maximum improvement is close to 10%. The mean improvement of the attractiveness dimen- sion of the cognitive beneÔ¨Åt necessary to increase the website ef- Ô¨Åciency is largely higher (7.64%), and the maximum improvement is a bit less than 37%. Table 7 shows the outcome of the regression analysis that adopted the super-efÔ¨Åciency measurement as dependent variable. In particular, a backward stepwise regression was performed, including all variables measuring cognitive costs and beneÔ¨Åts in the  Table 5 Framework variables and efÔ¨Åciency statistics.

F equal to 11.00 was adopted as a threshold to select variables to enter or remove from the regression model. At step 7, the regres- sion model includes 2 variables only, the Ô¨Årst one measuring the cognitive cost that the website users bear when they perceive ambiguity during navigation, and the second one the cognitive beneÔ¨Åt coming from the perceived website usefulness. Signs, negative for the Ô¨Årst variable, and positive for the second one, are consistent with the logics of the website evaluation framework. Cognitive efÔ¨Åciency seems mostly inÔ¨Çuenced by ambiguity perceived during website navigation, and by the cognitive beneÔ¨Åt associated to the amount of usefulness the user perceives. These Ô¨Åndings support what emerged from data in Table 6 relative to the improvement analysis to make websites efÔ¨Åcient. These data identiÔ¨Åed the speciÔ¨Åc component of cognitive costs generated by navigation ambiguity as critical, and website usefulness as a vari- able that remains indeed not modiÔ¨Åable.  5. Discussion and conclusion  The study has illustrated how the proposed framework based on the theories of cognition and the implementation of Data Envel- opment Analysis can be fruitfully used to carry on evaluation and comparison of ecommerce websites, with the aim to identify improvement trajectories. This framework models the usereweb- site interaction as a black box that provides the user with a set of functions that allow task performance. When these functions are exploited, a cognitive effort has to be made by the user, more or less balanced by a sense of gratiÔ¨Åcation which is associated to goal achievement. In this framework, the cognitive effort depends either on the amount of ambiguity and uncertainty perceived, or time  necessary to perform task during the interaction with the website. Cognitive beneÔ¨Åts associated to website usage include attraction for the website, and a feeling of satisfaction and usefulness for a full or partial goal achievement. As the framework provides a holistic view of the website efÔ¨Å- ciency and preliminary insights to further reÔ¨Ånement assessment, complementary methods and techniques such as eye-tracking and A/B split testing can be implemented helping to investigate deeper into the users cognitive behavior during their interaction with the websites, and to identify speciÔ¨Åc page areas or parts that have an impact on the users cognitive workload or beneÔ¨Åt (Bojko, 2006; Chatham et al., 2004; Djamasbi et al., 2010; Kohavi et al., 2009). For instance, if the time-related cognitive cost greatly affects the website cognitive efÔ¨Åciency, eye tracking experiments could be used to assess which page or component of a page makes it difÔ¨Åcult to locate the right starting point for an action. Indeed, cognitive psychology literature has showed how eye behavior is linked to user decision-making, reasoning and cognitive processing (Di Stasi et al., 2011; Rayner, 1998). Henceforth, several metrics used in eye tracking (Ô¨Åxation duration, gazing time, saccade rate, pupil dilata- tion, scanpath differences, etc.) may provide further insights into how website users process information and cognition develops, suggesting how to make search more efÔ¨Åcient (e.g., identifying links and control buttons more easily) or effective (e.g., under- standing the meaning of objects, and Ô¨Ånding effective patterns of action to achieve the target), and even discovering causes of a failed search. However, eye-tracking experiments are generally costly and time consuming because the assessment study should be neces- sarily conducted in a lab and one user at the time can be involved in the evaluation activity. On the contrary, the proposed framework provides clues about how users behave when interact with a number of websites at a lower cost. As a third stage of a more comprehensive evaluation analysis, the A/B split testing could be further implemented as a diagnostic tool to corroborate Ô¨Åndings from the proposed framework and eye tracking studies. The implementation of the framework preliminarily requires the knowledge of the technical system, the users, their goals, their cognitive and learning style. The performance of the cognitive ac- tivity during humanecomputer interaction is indeed the outcome of a number of factors, both objective and subjective (Ping Zhang, 2004).

For instance, some individuals do not like computers, do not feel familiar with Internet navigation, or are made anxious by them (Singh et al., 2001). Other individuals, vice versa, are strongly attracted by computers and have acquired a great capability to use Internet. Even, this latter group of individuals may have different preferences for interaction styles, colors, graphic presentations, data presentations, informa- tion structure, character type, etc. Kang and Yoon (2008) have demonstrated that the age of users may seriously affect their behavior when they interact with complicated electronic devices. The task typology may substantially inÔ¨Çuence the need of infor- mation of the user and the way this is effectively structured (Gay et al., 2001; Radha and Murphy, 1992). The cultural, ethnical, race background also affects the user attitudes toward the website assessment and the information need. So, for instance, users who have a cognitive and learning style more oriented to reÔ¨Çection might prefer websites that differ from those ones preferred by users having a cognitive and learning style more oriented to action (Kotz√©, 2000). Individuals differ as to their capability to process information. Each individual possesses a certain capability to pro- cess information which is independent of the task to perform (Scandura, 1971). Henceforth, the identiÔ¨Åcation of the information processing capability of a typical user of a website is important for designing more efÔ¨Åcient websites. A number of minor limitations emerged from the study that, however, do not call into question the importance and quality of the framework developed:   even though a well structured questionnaire has been designed and used to collect perceptual judgments to evaluate websites, the assessment framework based on cognition remains fundamentally qualitative, and e as a consequence e data subjectivity and context dependence can inÔ¨Çuence the output of the assessment. This issue should be taken in due consid- eration when assessment analyses are carried on;  the study was conducted in a setting of the users choice with the aim to simulate a real usereecommerce website interaction context. That impeded to have a rigorous control of the setting and the potential for interruptions and bias.  This framework has provided useful insights and similar studies can be useful either to design a new website or redesign an old website to improve the perception that users develop about it. In particular,   measurements relative to cognitive costs and beneÔ¨Åts that have been developed are indeed consistent with the logics underlying the framework, as the correlation analysis points out a negative association between costs and beneÔ¨Åts;  the implementation of DEA has showed that two model vari- ables have a major inÔ¨Çuence on website cognitive efÔ¨Åciency, the cognitive cost linked to ambiguity perceived during web- site navigation and the cognitive beneÔ¨Åt associated to the website perceived usefulness when the user interact with this latter. The stepwise regression analysis outcome supports these Ô¨Åndings;  as to the sample that has been used in the efÔ¨Åciency analysis, reducing cognitive costs for the users is more important than increasing their perceived beneÔ¨Åts. Furthermore, the naviga- bility dimension of the framework seems more critical;  the framework is extremely easy to use and can be adopted to evaluate and compare ecommerce websites that sell different products and services, not requiring any particular ability or knowledge of users to Ô¨Åll in the questionnaire;   as websites are compared only in the user perspective, it is unnecessary to collect any speciÔ¨Åc and conÔ¨Ådential informa- tion about the business (i.e., the number of contacts, online purchases, etc.);  the framework is Ô¨Çexible and further measurement scales can be introduced to investigate more in depth the determinants affecting the users cognition and their mental attitude toward the website, i.e. the perceived credibility about the website content, trust development, etc.;  including information relative to cognitive and learning style of users, Data Envelopment Analysis could be also used as an investigative technique useful for exploring the structure of judgments relative to the cognitive process dimensions of users that generate website rankings in order to identify variables that can inÔ¨Çuence these structures of preferences.  Appendix  A.1. Mathematical  formulation of data envelopment analysis  Charnes et al. (1978) deÔ¨Åned efÔ¨Åciency of a unit k as follows:  P Pr  hk ¬º  y ¬º 1 vkyOky s x ¬º 1 ukx Ikx  where Ikx ¬º the quantity of input x utilized by unit k; Oky ¬º the quantity of output y supplied by unit k; ukx ¬º the weight associated to input x; vky ¬º the weight associated to input y; r ¬º the number of inputs; s ¬º the number of outputs; hk ¬º the efÔ¨Åciency of unit k; n ¬º the number of units. The values of weights ukx and vky for a generic unit are determined with the goal to maximize its efÔ¨Åciency e as possible as close to 100%, while keeping the efÔ¨Åciency of other units having the same weights lower than 100%. In the basic DEA formulation (CCR model), the efÔ¨Åciency of unit k is calculated determining values of uk1, uk2, ., ukr and vk1, vk2, ., vks that maximize  k  This latter constraint imposes that no other unit may have an ef- Ô¨Åciency measure greater than 100% with the same weights. The original formulation can be conveniently rewritten through an algebraic manipulation of the constraint to maximize  hk ¬º  vkyOky  subject to:  Xr  x ¬º 1  ukx Ikx ¬º 1  and0  @ Xs  y ¬º 1  1 A     Xr  x ¬º 1  !  uky Iix  vkyOiy   0  for i ¬º 1; 2; .; k; .; n  hk ¬º  y ¬º 1 vkyOky x ¬º 1 ukx Ikx  subject to:  hi ¬º  y ¬º 1 vkyOiy x ¬º 1 ukx Iix  Ps Pr  Ps Pr  Xs  y ¬º 1   1  for i ¬º 1; 2; .k; .; n  
C.  lo Storto / Applied Ergonomics 44 (2013) 1004e1014  1013  ukx  0;  vky  0;  for every value of k; x and y  where the Ô¨Årst constraint sets the normalization of nator in the original efÔ¨Åciency measure to 100%. The basic formulation is thus transformed into a set of n linear programming problems, one for each unit k. Andersen and Petersen (1993) suggest to calculate efÔ¨Åciency of units modifying the constraint in the original lation of the CCR model as follows  super- formu-  the denomi-  !  0 @ Xs  y ¬º 1  1 A     Xr  x ¬º 1  vkyOiy  uky Iix   0  for i ¬º 1; 2; .; n with isk  This means that this constraint is omitted for the unit i ¬º k.

s0003687013000896,"  Biomechanical analysis and electromyogram (EMG) recordings are widely used to evaluate physical stress and fatigue; they are also applied to design problems of work environments and consumer products in order to reduce physical work load (ChafÔ¨Ån et al., 2006; Tsang and Vidulich, 2006). EMGs record the actual electrical ac- tivity of a muscle. However, EMG recordings require preliminary measurements, such as measurement of the maximum voluntary contraction for normalization (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 1992); hence, it is time consuming and imposes strain on subjects. In addition, measured EMG recordings evaluate muscle load on only the intended motion; thus, re-measurement of EMGs is necessary when the design variables of work environments and consumer products are changed. Physical load evaluation based on a biomechanical model with the joint angle and joint moment requires the measurements of only the joint angle and external force. Therefore, the experimental cost and strain on subjects may be lower for a biomechanical analysis than for EMG measurements. Biomechanical analysis does not necessarily require experimentation, because the analysis can  * Corresponding author. Tel.: √æ81 42 585 8685; fax: √æ81 42 583 5119. chihara@sd.tmu.ac.jp (T.

The time that can be allocated to improving work environments or designing consumer products is decreasing with each passing year, in conjunction with the shortening of the development period. That is, an ergonomic physical load evaluation should be performed effectively in a short time. Thus, it is essential to develop an ergo- nomic design using a biomechanical analysis model that performs physical load evaluation more efÔ¨Åciently than EMG measurements (Lestrelin and Trasbot, 2005; LaFiandra, 2009). Research on postural discomfort imposed by varying joint angles has been reported (Kee and Lee, 2012). The relationships between the perceived discomfort and joint angle have been studied (Kee and Karwowski, 2001, 2004; Chung et al., 2003). Miedema et al. (1997) studied the effects of joint angle and duration on perceived discomfort, whereas Carey and Gallwey (2005) along with Khan et al. (2010) investigated the effects of joint angle and repetition. The ranking of perceived discomfort of joint motions have been investigated (Genaidy and Karwowski, 1993; Kee and Karwowski, 2003). The relationship between perceived discomfort and joint angle can be used to evaluate the discomfort of arbitrary human postures. However, in real situations of working or using a product, arbitrary external forces will act on the human body, and arbitrary moments will act on each joint. In addition, because perceived discomfort is affected more by the joint moment than the joint angle  0003-6870/$ e see front matter √ì 2013 Elsevier Ltd and The Ergonomics Society.

T. Chihara et al.  / Applied Ergonomics 45 (2014) 308e317  309  (Carey and Gallwey, 2002; Dickerson et al., 2006), the relationship between perceived discomfort and joint moment should be quan- tiÔ¨Åed to improve the accuracy of perceived discomfort evaluation. The maximum joint moments that subjects can exert have been measured (Amundsen, 1990; ChafÔ¨Ån et al., 2006; National Institute of Technology and Evaluation, 2009). In these reports, the average maximum joint moment among subjects was measured, and the relationship between the maximum joint moment and joint angle was represented. Boussenna et al. (1982) investigated the re- lationships between the perceived discomfort and joint moments of the hip, knee, and ankle. Wang et al. (2004) investigated the relationship between the perceived discomfort and biomechanical parameters, including the joint moments when depressing a clutch pedal. Mukhopadhyay et al. (2007) investigated the effects of the joint moment of forearm pronation, forearm rotation angle, elbow angle, and exertion frequency on the perceived discomfort. How- ever, they did not investigate the quantitative effect of the joint moment magnitude on perceived discomfort. Dickerson et al. (2006) investigated the effects of the shoulder joint moment, position of operation object, and stature of subjects on perceived discomfort in a simulated workstation. Perceived discomfort, which was measured by varying the direction and magnitude of external force, was mostly affected by, and repre- sented as a linear function of, the shoulder joint moment. However, they did not investigate the effect of joint motion direction of the shoulder joint (i.e., extension, Ô¨Çexion, abduction, adduction, inter- nal rotation, and external rotation). In addition, the perceived dis- comforts of the elbow and wrist joints were not considered, although the discomfort of other joints may be as important as that of the shoulder joint. Moreover, the abovementioned reports on the relationship between the perceived discomfort and joint moment or joint angle did not quantify individual differences. The perceived discomfort function for upper limb joints should be formulated by considering the variability so as to take into account human di- versity during developing ergonomic design. The objective of the present study was to formulate the rela- tionship between the perceived discomfort and joint moment by considering the variability of subjective evaluation, and to consider differences among the joint motion directions of the upper limb (i.e., shoulder extension, shoulder Ô¨Çexion, shoulder adduction, shoulder abduction, shoulder internal rotation, shoulder external rotation, elbow extension, elbow Ô¨Çexion, wrist extension, wrist Ô¨Çexion, wrist ulnar deviation, and wrist radial deviation). In this study, the perceived discomforts of subjects were measured when they exer- ted joint moments of arbitrary magnitude in each joint motion di- rection. The response surfaces of perceived discomfort were approximated by three different approximation models: linear, exponential, and logistic function models. The logistic function model was selected as the best approximation model because its accuracy was highest among the three models. The concept of fuzzy number was used to represent the variability of perceived discom- fort among subjects. Finally, clustering the evaluation functions of perceived discomfort for each joint motion direction revealed that the function for the upper limb could be divided into two clusters.  2. Method  2.1. Measurement of perceived discomfort  Ten healthy Japanese male subjects, aged between 21 and 25, participated in this experiment. All of them were university students, right handed, and none of the subjects had a musculoskeletal dis- order. Their stature, weight, and gripping force are listed in Table 1. The target joint motion directions were the six directions of the shoulder joint (i.e., shoulder extension, shoulder Ô¨Çexion, shoulder  adduction, shoulder abduction, shoulder internal rotation, and shoulder external rotation), two directions of the elbow joint (i.e., elbow extension and elbow Ô¨Çexion), and four directions of the wrist joint (i.e., wrist extension, wrist Ô¨Çexion, wrist ulnar deviation, and wrist radial deviation). The subjects sat and exerted joint moments by holding a weight with the dominant hand in the instructed upper limb postures shown in Fig. 1. Note that the forearm is in the pronated position in Fig. 1(i) and in the supinated position in Fig. 1(j); the others are in neutral positions. The joint moment was calculated by magnitude of holding weight and the related segment length of each subject. The maximum joint moment for each subject was measured, after which joint moments with magnitudes of approximately 20, 40, and 60% of the premeasured maximum joint moment were added by adjusting the weight. The subjects kept the instructed postures for 10 s. The magnitude of joint moments was controlled by adjusting the weight. In addition, joint moments lower than the above- mentioned magnitudes were added if a subject judged the magni- tude as excessive. There was a 5-min rest period after each trial. The perceived discomfort was measured by the category parti- tioning scale 50 (CP-50) (Shen and Parsons, 1997). The CP-50 has a starting point (i.e., 0 ¬º no) and Ô¨Åve categories (i.e., very slight discomfort, slight discomfort, discomfort, severe discomfort, and very severe discomfort). Thus, the ranges for each category are given as follows:  ‚ÄúVery slight discomfort‚Äù: 1e10 ‚ÄúSlight discomfort‚Äù: 11e20 ‚ÄúDiscomfort‚Äù: 21e30 ‚ÄúSevere discomfort‚Äù: 31e40 ‚ÄúVery severe discomfort‚Äù: 41e50  Each of the categories is further subdivided into 10 scale points. Subjects Ô¨Årst choose the category to which a stimulus belongs, and then choose the degree among the 10 scale points. In this study, the subjects were instructed to rate their perceived discomfort for each magnitude of joint moment assuming the discomfort they perceive when exerting their maximum moment to be 50. The maximum discomfort level was set for all maximum joint moment in each subject and joint motion direction. It should be note that subject may not feel the same level of discomfort between the maximum joint moments at different joint motion directions. This experiment was approved by the Research Safety and Ethics Committee of Tokyo Metropolitan University.  2.2.  Selection of approximation model  The perceived discomfort probably increases as the magnitude of the joint moment increases. Therefore, the approximation model for the perceived discomfort function must be a monotonically  Table 1 Stature, weight, and gripping force of subjects.  Subject  A B C D E F G H I J Average S. D.

We assume that monotonically nonlinear functions are mainly divided into three types: those that increase during the early (Type 1), middle (Type 2), and late (Type 3) part of the function. In this study, the three function approximation models are set as follows:  y ¬º ax √æ b  y ¬º a √æ b$exp√∞cx√û  y ¬º  a  1 √æ expfb√∞x   c√ûg  (1)  (2)  (3)  where x and y denote the explanatory and objective variables, respectively, and a, b, and c are regression coefÔ¨Åcients. Equation (1) represents the linear model. Eq. (2), which represents the expo- nential model, can express Type 1 and Type 3 functions. In addition, Eq. (3), which represents the logistic model, can express Type 2 functions. In this study, the perceived discomfort W (W ¬º [0, 50]), which is measured by the CP-50, is set as the objective variable, and the joint moment divided by the maximum joint moment (hereafter referred to as ‚Äúthe joint moment ratio r (r ¬º [0, 1])‚Äù) is set as the explanatory variable. The response surface of the perceived discomfort f(r) is approximated with the three models for each joint motion direction and subject. The regression coefÔ¨Åcients are  obtained by minimizing the average absolute error (AAE). The AAE for i-th function model, j-th joint motion direction, and k-th subject was calculated as follows:  Pn  l ¬º 1  AAEijk ¬º  r  Ô¨ÉÔ¨ÉÔ¨ÉÔ¨ÉÔ¨ÉÔ¨ÉÔ¨ÉÔ¨ÉÔ¨ÉÔ¨ÉÔ¨ÉÔ¨ÉÔ¨ÉÔ¨ÉÔ¨ÉÔ¨ÉÔ¨ÉÔ¨ÉÔ¨ÉÔ¨ÉÔ¨ÉÔ¨ÉÔ¨ÉÔ¨ÉÔ¨ÉÔ¨ÉÔ¨ÉÔ¨ÉÔ¨ÉÔ¨É  2  dijkl   by ijkl  n  by ijkl  (4)  dijkl  where, and denote the measured and approximated perceived discomfort level for l-th joint moment ratio, and n is the number of the level of joint moment ratio. In addition, the AAE for i- th function model was calculated by averaging AAEijk among the subjects. The AAEs of response surfaces are compared between the three approximation models, and the model with the lowest AAE is selected for the perceived discomfort function. One-way ANOVA was conducted at the 5% signiÔ¨Åcance level, and post-hoc tests were carried out to compare the three models. ANOVA was conducted for each joint motion direction.  2.3. Formulation of perceived discomfort by considering human variability  The variability of individual differences in perceived discomfort should be quantiÔ¨Åed. Personal factors such as stature, weight, and gripping force may be set as state variables of the perceived discomfort function so as to quantify individual differences, if the factors correlate with function parameters such as the regression

However, the personal factors may not always correlate with the function parameters. Therefore, if the personal factors do not correlate with the function parame- ters, the variability of individual differences should be quantiÔ¨Åed with a method that is different from taking the personal factors as the state variables. In such case, it is ideal to predict the detailed distribution of perceived discomfort by performing an experiment with a large number of conditions (i.e., the joint moment ratio) and subjects. However, it may be difÔ¨Åcult to perform a sufÔ¨Åcient number of experiments for predicting the detailed distribution. In this study, the concept of fuzzy number (Dubois and Prade, 1980) is used to represent the between-subject variability of perceived discomfort and thereby formulate the perceived discomfort function. The distribution of perceived discomfort may possibly become asymmetric. The asymmetric distribution is more general, and the symmetric distribution, which has the same de- gree of spread on each side, is one of special example of the asymmetric distribution. Therefore, in this study, the distribution of perceived discomfort is expressed by the L-R fuzzy number (Dubois and Prade, 1978), which has a different degree of spread on each side. It is note that the left and right extents of L-R fuzzy number become the same, if a data set is distributed symmetrically. In other words, the L-R fuzzy number can deal with both the symmetric and asymmetric distribution. In addition, the concept of fuzzy number was applied to express the human uncertainty and variability (Karwowski et al., 1984; Karwowski, 1992; Lee et al., 2003). Therefore, we consider that the fuzzy model can be applied to our study. Fig. 2 shows the triangular L-R fuzzy number used in this study to simplify the distribution of perceived discomfort. The horizontal and vertical axes in Fig. 2 represent the perceived discomfort and probability, respectively. Wmode denotes the mode of perceived discomfort to which the response surface of the perceived discomfort is applied. Here, the mode is the value that appears most often in a data set. a and b e the left and right extents, respectively, of the L-R fuzzy number e are deÔ¨Åned as functions of the joint moment ratio. Pmax, which denotes the probability at the mode of perceived discomfort, is given by the following equation with the constraint that the sum of probabilities equals one:  Pmax ¬º  2  a√∞r√û √æ b√∞r√û  (5)  Here, a and b are represented by quadratic functions approxi- mated on the basis of the minimum and maximum perceived dis- comforts for each joint moment ratio. In addition, a and b are branched in order to prevent the lower and upper bounds from falling below 0 and exceeding 50, respectively. and are respectively expressed as follows:  a  b                   311  (6)  (7)  where ai and bi (i ¬º 1, 2, 3) are the regression coefÔ¨Åcients of a and b, respectively. The perceived discomfort function with human vari- ability is thus deÔ¨Åned by a triplet (Wmode, a, b). Fig. 3 shows the conceptual diagram of perceived discomfort function. It is note that the logistic model was taken as the example. As shown in Fig. 3, the variability of the subjects or the distribution of perceived discom- fort is expressed roughly by the L-R fuzzy number in the given joint moment ratio.  2.4.  Clustering of response surfaces  The response surfaces of the mode of perceived discomfort for twelve joint motion directions are clustered so as to consider dif- ferences among the joint motion directions. The comparison be- tween the discomfort functions may be performed without adopting the cluster analysis. However, it is difÔ¨Åcult to deÔ¨Åne the discomfort functions are almost the same or completely different. Therefore, the clustering method was adopted to draw a line be- tween the discomfort functions that have the different trends. The clustering steps are as follows:  Step 1 The AAEs of the response surfaces for each joint motion direction Ei (i ¬º 1, 2, ., 12) are calculated. Step 2 The number of clusters, m, is set to 1. Step 3 The twelve response surfaces are divided into m clusters based on the parameters of the selected approximation function model. Step 4 The response surfaces for each divided cluster are predicted by using the experimental data belonging to each cluster. Step 5 The AAE of the j-th cluster‚Äôs response surface for the i-th joint motion direction ei,j is calculated. Step 6 T-tests between Ei and ei,j are carried out. If there is no signiÔ¨Åcant difference for all i-th joint motion directions, the clustering sequence is terminated. Otherwise, m ¬º m √æ 100 and return to step 3.  In step 5, we note that the i-th joint motion direction belongs in the case of m ¬º 2, to the j-th cluster. For example, if the Ô¨Årst and second clusters contain i ¬º 1, 2, 10, 11, 12 and i ¬º 3, 4, ., 9, respectively, the AAEs ei,1 (i ¬º 1, 2, 10, 11, 12) and ei,2 (i ¬º 3, 4, .,  max  ‚éõ ‚éú ‚éù  Pmax(Œ±, Œ≤)  P  max  Œ±,0  (  W  +  Œ± ‚àí  W  mode  ‚éû  )‚éü  ‚é†  max  ‚éõ ‚éú‚éú ‚éù  ‚àí  ,0  P  max  Œ≤  (  W  ‚àí  Œ≤ ‚àí  W  mode  )‚éü‚éü ‚éû ‚é†  W  50  Wmode(r)  Wmode(r) + Œ≤(r)  Wmode(r)  Œ±(r)  Œ≤(r)  Fig. 2.

Regression coefÔ¨Åcient of response surface  The perceived discomfort functions of each joint motion di- rection were predicted by using the experimental data of all subjects, because the abovementioned personal factors could not represent individual differences in perceived discomfort. Tables 2 and 3 depict the regression coefÔ¨Åcients of the perceived discomfort function and L-R fuzzy number, respectively. Table 4 lists the AAE and maximum error of the perceived discomfort functions. As depicted in Table 4, the AAEs of the twelve func- tions range from 3.4 to 5.5, or 6.8e11% of the scale of perceived discomfort. In addition, the maximum errors range from 13 to 21. In addition, the perceived discomfort functions have scores with a range of 20e30 points based on between-subject variability.  3.4.  Comparison and clustering of response surfaces  Cluster analysis was performed on the twelve perceived discomfort functions and the number of clusters determined based on the procedure proposed in Section 2.4. The maximum sensitivity and inÔ¨Çection point, deÔ¨Åned in Section 3.2, were taken as the var- iables of the cluster analysis. Table 5 shows the maximum sensi- tivity and the inÔ¨Çection point of the twelve perceived discomfort functions. Table 5 shows that the perceived discomfort function of elbow Ô¨Çexion has the highest maximum sensitivity and lowest inÔ¨Çection point among the twelve functions. The twelve functions were divided into two clusters based on the proposed procedure proposed in Section 2.4. The Ô¨Årst cluster consists of eleven functions except that of elbow Ô¨Çexion; the sec- ond cluster consists of the perceived discomfort function of elbow Ô¨Çexion. The function for the Ô¨Årst cluster is given as follows:  Line ar model Exponential model Logis tic function mode l  9) are calculated. In step 6, the t-test is carried out at the 5% signiÔ¨Åcance level. The divided clusters indicate the difference of history trend toward the transition of joint moment ratio.  3. Result  3.1.  Comparison of approximation error  The result of ANOVA shows that all joint motion directions except the wrist radial deviation have the main effect of approximation model. Fig. 4 shows a comparison of the average AAE among subjects. The AAE of the linear model is signiÔ¨Åcantly higher than that of the exponential or logistic function model, except in the case of wrist radial deviation. In addition, the lo- gistic function model shows the lowest AAE among the three approximation models in all joint motion directions except the shoulder Ô¨Çexion. The average AAE of the logistic function model is around 2.0, which corresponds to approximately 4.0% of the scale of perceived discomfort. Therefore, the logistic function model is selected as the function approximation model of perceived discomfort.  3.2. Correlation between response surface parameters and participants‚Äô features  A correlation analysis between the personal factors of subjects (i.e., the stature, weight, and gripping force) and the parameters of the logistic function was carried out to consider the personal factors that can be set as state variables of the perceived discomfort function. Fig. 5 shows a conceptual diagram of the logistic function, which reaches a maximum sensitivity of eab/4 at x ¬º c (i.e., in- Ô¨Çection point). This implies that the larger the eab/4 value, the more rapidly the function rises. In addition, the larger the c value, the earlier the function rises. Thus, in this study, the maximum sensitivity eab/4 and inÔ¨Çection point c are selected as the param- eters of the logistic function. Fig. 6 shows the correlation coefÔ¨Åcient between the personal factors and logistic function parameters. The maximum sensitivity is signiÔ¨Åcantly correlated with the weight in the case of wrist ulnar deviation at the 5% signiÔ¨Åcance level; however, no other correlation is signiÔ¨Åcant. Similarly, no factors other than the stature and grip- ping force in the case of shoulder extension are signiÔ¨Åcantly correlated with the inÔ¨Çection point.  r  o  r r  e  e  t  u  l  o  s  b  a  e  g  a  r  e  v  A  12.0  10.0  8.0  6.0  4.0  2.0  0.0  Shoulder extens ion  Shoulder flexion  Shoulder adduction  Shoulder abduction  Shoulder internal rotation  Shoulder external rotation  Elbow extens ion  Elbow flexion  Wrist extens ion  Wrist flexion  Wrist ulnar deviation  Wrist radial deviation  Fig. 4.

Selection of regression model  for perceived discomfort  According to Fig. 4, the AAEs of nonlinear models (i.e., the exponential and logistic function models) are lower than that of the  linear model. Therefore, the perceived discomfort caused by joint moment exertion is probably nonlinear. The response surfaces and measured data of shoulder Ô¨Çexion, elbow Ô¨Çexion, and wrist Ô¨Çexion  are depicted in Fig. 9 as examples. It is note that the measured data of all subjects are plotted. Fig. 9 also implies that the perceived discomfort is nonlinear. In addition, the logistic function model has the lowest AAE among the three models for nearly all joint motion directions. That is, the logistic function model provides the best Ô¨Åt to the history of perceived discomfort among the three approxi- mation models. We conclude that the logistic function model may best predict the perceived discomfort across the entire range of joint moment ratios.  -1.0  -0.8  -0.6  -0.4  -0.2  0.0  0.2  0.4  0.6  0.8  1.0  Shoulder extension  Shoulder flexion  Shoulder adduction  Shoulder abduction  Shoulder internal  rotation  Shoulder external  rotation  Elbow extension  Elbow flexion  Wrist extension  Wrist flexion  Wrist ulnar  deviation  Wrist radial  deviation  C  o  r r  e  l  a  i t  n o  c  o  e  f f  i  c  i  e  n  t  Stature  Weight  Gripping force  *  (a) Maximum sensitivity ‚Äìab/4  -1.0  -0.8  -0.6  -0.4  -0.2  0.0  0.2  0.4  0.6  0.8  1.0  Shoulder extension  Shoulder flexion  Shoulder adduction  Shoulder abduction  Shoulder internal rotation  Shoulder external rotation  Elbow extension  Elbow flexion  Wrist extension  Wrist flexion  Wrist ulnar deviation  Wrist radial deviation  C  o  r r  e  l  a  i t  n o  c  o  e  f f  i  c  i  e  n  t  Stature  Weight  Gripping force  **  *  (b) Inflection point c  Fig. 6.

InÔ¨Çuence of personal  factors  Correlation coefÔ¨Åcients between the personal factors of partic- ipants and logistic function parameters of the perceived discomfort functions predicted for each subject were obtained. Hardly any signiÔ¨Åcant correlations were found between the personal factors and logistic function parameters. In addition, correlative trends between personal factors and logistic function parameters are difÔ¨Åcult to discern for all joint motion directions. Thus, personal factors cannot be used as state variables of the perceived discom- fort function.  4.3. InÔ¨Çuence of variability and joint motion direction on perceived discomfort  The perceived discomfort functions for the twelve joint motion directions were predicted as shown in Tables 2 and 3. From Table 4, the maximum errors of the predicted functions correspond to approximately 10e20% of the perceived discomfort scale used here. In addition, the perceived discomfort score is varies widely due to the between-subject variability, because the perceived discomfort scores are distributed with a range of 20e30 points, which corre- sponds to 40e60% of the perceived discomfort scale. This agrees with the proposal that the between-subject variability of perceived discomfort should be considered when perceived discomfort functions are estimated. The twelve perceived discomfort functions were divided into two clusters: one consisting of the functions of the eleven joint motion directions excluding that of elbow Ô¨Çexion, and a second consisting of the function of elbow Ô¨Çexion. Therefore, most of the perceived discomforts for the joint motion directions of the upper limbs are expressed by a single function described in Eqs. (7)e(9). In addition, the function of elbow Ô¨Çexion has the highest maximum sensitivity and lowest inÔ¨Çection point (see Table 5). This indicates  Table 3 Regression coefÔ¨Åcients of L-R fuzzy number.

This may be explained by the three main agonist muscles for elbow Ô¨Çexion: the brachialis, biceps brachii, and brachioradialis. Among these, the brachioradialis works only when the muscle is subjected to extreme force (Neumann, 2009). Thus, the brachioradialis may have hardly worked during the measurement of perceived discomfort while it worked during the measurement of maximum joint moment. The lack of muscle activity of brachioradialis may have invoked the change of function patterns for the elbow Ô¨Çexion. That is, the all three agonist muscles (i.e., the brachialis, biceps brachii, and brachioradialis) worked during the measurement of maximum joint moment (i.e., the joint moment ratio r ¬º 1.0), while the two muscles except the brachioradialis mainly worked during the measurement with relatively low magnitude of joint moment ratio (i.e., r ¬º 0.2 and 0.4). Therefore, the perceived discomfort at the low joint moment ratio level for the elbow Ô¨Çexion was higher than that of the other joint motion directions. Thus, the function of elbow Ô¨Çexion has higher sensitivity at low joint moment ratio compared with that of the other joint motions, and the model for the elbow Ô¨Çexion showed different patterns from other joint motions. Bj√∂rkst√©n and Jonsson (1977) concluded that 8% of the maximum voluntary force of contraction was recommended for static exertion. Fig. 10 shows the probability distribution when the joint motion ratio equals 8%. The peaks of both clusters range from 1 to 10, which indicates ‚Äúslight discomfort.‚Äù Although this may agree with the result of the earlier study (Bj√∂rkst√©n and Jonsson, 1977), the populations of ‚Äúslight discomfort‚Äù for the two clusters are different. In the case of the Ô¨Årst cluster, 96% of the subjects belong to ‚Äúslight discomfort,‚Äù whereas 80% belong in the case of the second cluster. Therefore, the joint moment ratio for elbow Ô¨Çexion may need to be lower than that for the other joint motion directions  Table 5 Maximum sensitivity and inÔ¨Çection point of perceived discomfort function.

so as to reduce the perceived discomfort for sensitive individuals. In this way, the proposed method can perform quantitative evaluation of the variability of perceived discomfort based on human diversity.  4.4. Validation of proposed model  To validate the accuracy of response surfaces by limited number of data, the cross-validation (leave-one-out) method can be used  (Miller and Miller, 2010; Boukouvala and Ierapetritou, 2012). As an example, the cross-validation method was applied to the response surface of the shoulder Ô¨Çexion; that is, the response surface was developed by the data of nine subjects out of ten (i.e., the training  0  10  20  30  40  50  0.0  0.2  0.4 0.6 Joint moment ratio  0.8  1.0  P  e  r  e c  i  v  e  d  d  i  s  c  o  m  f  o  r  t  Logistic model  Linear model  Exponential model  (a) Shoulder flexion   0  10  20  30  40  50  0.0  0.2  0.4 0.6 Joint moment ratio  0.8  1.0  P  e  r  e c  i  v  e  d  d  i  s  c  o  m  f  o  r  t  Logistic model  Linear model  Exponential model  (b) Elbow flexion   0  10  20  30  40  50  0.0  0.2  0.4 0.6 Joint moment ratio  0.8  1.0  P  e  r  e c  i  v  e  d  d  i  s  c  o  m  f  o  r  t  Logistic model  Linear model  Exponential model  (c) Wrist flexion   Fig. 9.

As shown in Table 6, the average AAEs of ten subjects are almost the same as RSME of response surface developed by the ten subjects‚Äô data. Therefore, we consider that the logistic function model is appropriate for expressing the perceived discomfort. However, some subjects have relatively high AAE; especially the AAE of subject F is approximately twice as that of ten subjects. This is because, the subjects has variability as shown in Fig. 9. In this study, the L-R fuzzy number was applied to deal with the variability of individual differences; and the distribution of perceived discomfort was expressed. In addition, the similar results with the shoulder Ô¨Çexion were obtained for the other joint motion directions. Thus, we conclude that the proposed function approx- imation model with the L-R fuzzy number is appropriate to express the perceived discomfort with the variability of individual differences.  5.  Conclusions  In this study, an approximation method of the perceived discomfort function for upper limb joint motion directions is pro- posed. The major Ô¨Åndings are as follows:  1. The perceived discomfort caused by joint moment exertion shows a nonlinear trend. In addition, the logistic function provides the best Ô¨Åt as the perceived discomfort function among the three function approximation models tested: the linear, exponential, and logistic function models. 2. The perceived discomfort scores vary widely because of indi- vidual differences between subjects. However, using the per- sonal factors of stature, weight, and gripping force as the state variables of the perceived discomfort function is difÔ¨Åcult. 3. The twelve perceived discomfort functions are divided into two clusters: one for elbow Ô¨Çexion and another for the remaining eleven joint motion directions. In addition, the perceived discomfort of elbow Ô¨Çexion is more sensitive than that of other motions to an increase in the joint moment ratio.  The proposed model is useful for proactive work environment design when the perceived discomfort of the upper limb is the main determinant factor. The joint moment can be calculated by using a biomechanical model; for example, many commercial software can be used (LaFiandra, 2009). In addition, the maximum joint mo- ments have been measured by many researchers (Amundsen, 1990; ChafÔ¨Ån et al., 2006; National Institute of Technology and Evaluation, 2009). Therefore, the joint moment ratio can be calcu- lated for an intended task, and then the perceived discomfort is  evaluated by the proposed method. The combination use of the proposed model and the biomechanical model gives predicted value of perceived discomfort of workers without time-consuming experiment. It is expected that the proposed model may contribute to the efÔ¨Åcient work environment design.  Acknowledgments  This work was 24760123.  "

Therefore, the training session included several practice sessions and was held in small groups of Ô¨Åve to eight participants to give participants the opportunity to ask questions individually. Participants were guided through the task procedure by an instructor. First, participants were introduced to the start-up procedure in a step-by-step manner. In a next step, participants conducted the start-up procedure by themselves but with guidance and support by the instructor. Finally, participants completed the start-up procedure on their own.

350  D. Burkolter et al.  / Applied Ergonomics 45 (2014) 346e353  In the subsequent testing session, participants were asked to start-up the reactor. In addition, participants needed to handle the practiced fault state (system fault of a feedwater pump) without knowing in beforehand that the fault would occur. Then, they were to start-up the reactor and handle a novel fault state which they had not encountered before (system fault of turbine). Again, par- ticipants were not aware previously that this fault would occur. Following these tasks, mental workload and situation awareness were assessed. Situation awareness was measured as described above while the participants were performing a combination of the start-up and shutdown procedures. Finally, the questionnaire regarding user acceptance was Ô¨Ålled in by the participants. While the exercises and type of tasks in training and testing session were the same for both groups, the RG used their recon- Ô¨Ågured user interface whereas the CG used the initial one. The RG was introduced to the reconÔ¨Åguration tool and its usage before starting with the exercises. This introduction to the reconÔ¨Åguration tool had a duration of approximately 10 min and included expla- nations of the possibilities and tools as well as time for practicing with the reconÔ¨Åguration tool and exploring its options. The par- ticipants of the RG were then given 10 min after each of the three exercises to reconÔ¨Ågure their user interface in a way to increase performance at the task. ReconÔ¨Åguration was only possible during the training phase. While the RG group was introduced to the reconÔ¨Åguration tool and was given time to reconÔ¨Ågure their own user interfaces, the CG was given other tasks with the same dura- tion and similar workload to ensure comparability. During the time in which the RG was introduced to the reconÔ¨Åguration tool (about 10 min), the CG was shown a sequence of a documentary about simulations. The topic of the documentary was supposed to be unrelated to the reactor simulation and the user interface. While the RG was reconÔ¨Åguring their user interfaces, the CG sketched  ideas of possible improvements and adaptations to the user inter- face using pen and paper.  2.5.  ReconÔ¨Åguration  The reconÔ¨Åguration tool allowed four different types of recon- Ô¨Åguration operations applied interactively to the interaction ele- ments of the user interface (e.g., buttons or sliders): (1) the duplication of a single interaction element, (2) the removal or deletion of an interaction element, (3) the sequencing of two or more operations triggered by discrete interaction elements (but- tons) into one step that is triggered by one new button, and (4) discretization of continuous interaction elements (such as sliders) into one discrete interaction element as has been described above. Other than the four basic reconÔ¨Åguration types, it was also possible (5) to combine discretization and sequencing (cf. Weyers et al., 2010). These reconÔ¨Ågurations of the user interface mainly involved adaption of its physical representation such as adding a new button. Using these reconÔ¨Åguration operations, it was possible to sequence various steps of the start-up, shut-down and handling routines for fault states, such as combining opening and closing of valves and setting water pumps to previously discretized values. Some parts of the routines, however, could not be subsumed by reconÔ¨Åguration, such as the alternating the increase of water pump 1 and the control rods as part of the start-up routine. A screenshot of a reconÔ¨Ågured user interface by a participant in our study is shown in Fig. 2 as an example. In Table 3, number and percentages of reconÔ¨Åguration types used by the study participants are presented. Discretization was the reconÔ¨Åguration type that was most frequently used, followed by the combination of sequencing and discretization and sequencing alone.  Fig. 2. Screenshot of a reconÔ¨Ågured user interface of one study participant (translated from German). The participant used different reconÔ¨Åguration operations (e.g., sequencing) to build up the procedure of start-up (bottom, left), shut-down of the reactor (bottom, right), and the practiced fault state (top, right). In this case, the original user interface still existed (top, left), slightly modiÔ¨Åed in position of sliders and color of buttons.

Assessment of control variables  We controlled for pre-training knowledge, subjective rating of knowledge level, cognitive Ô¨Çexibility, and general mental ability. Pre-training knowledge was measured with seven multiple-choice questions about nuclear power plants (e.g., ‚ÄúHow is electricity produced in a power plant?‚Äù). In addition, participants were asked to give subjective assessment of their previous knowledge about nuclear power plants on a seven-point scale ranging from (1) very poor to (7) very good. General mental ability was assessed with the Wonderlic Personnel Test (Wonderlic Inc., 2002). Due to time constraints, general mental ability was assessed at a later date (on which not all of the participants could take part, n ¬º 43). Cognitive Ô¨Çexibility was assessed with the Cognitive Flexibility Inventory (Spiro et al., 1996). Participants in the two groups did not differ signiÔ¨Åcantly with regard to control variables which indicates that there was not an ‚Äúunhappy randomization‚Äù (Mohr, 1995; see Table 4).  3. Results  3.1.  Performance: errors  In line with our assumptions, performance of the RG was better than performance of the CG which is shown by the total number of errors committed (see Table 5). Both during start-up of the reactor and the practiced fault state as well as the novel fault state, the RG (practiced: M ¬º SD ¬º 1.93; novel: M ¬º 1.72, SD ¬º 1.62) committed signiÔ¨Åcantly fewer errors 2.48, than the CG (practiced: M ¬º 5.53, SD ¬º 2.71; novel: M ¬º 3.38, SD ¬º 2.32). Thus, the RG committed about half as many errors than the CG, constituting a large effect in the case of the practiced fault state (r ¬º .54) and a medium to large effect in the case of the novel fault state (r ¬º .38; Field, 2005; Cohen, 1992). Regarding the types of errors during start-up and practiced fault state, the RG committed signiÔ¨Åcantly fewer ‚Äúoversteering‚Äù errors, ‚Äúswap‚Äù errors, and ‚Äúfalse operations‚Äù.

User acceptance  Descriptive statistics as well as results of t-tests regarding user acceptance scales can be found in Table 6. As expected, participants in the RG showed signiÔ¨Åcantly higher acceptance of the user in- terfaces than the CG, except from ratings regarding perceived re- from  3 sponsibility and handling of task. On a scale to 3, participants in the RG rated their behavioral intention to use the user interface again almost 2 on average (SD ¬º 1.07) whereas the CG intention to use 0.5 on average (SD ¬º 1.68). rated their behavioral This difference between the two groups was signiÔ¨Åcant and (r ¬º .53; constituted a large effect Field, 2005; Cohen, 1992).

352  D. Burkolter et al.  / Applied Ergonomics 45 (2014) 346e353  Similarly, perceived usefulness was rated signiÔ¨Åcantly higher by the RG (M ¬º 1.95, SD ¬º 1.05) than the CG (M ¬º 0.40, SD ¬º 1.47) and also this effect was large (r ¬º .53). Furthermore, there was a signiÔ¨Åcant difference between the groups regarding perceived behavioral control, although the effect was smaller (r ¬º .22). The reconÔ¨Ågured user interface received thus a higher user acceptance rating than the default user interface. However, user acceptance of the default user interface was still on the positive side on the scale from  3 to 3. Finally, the RG rated perceived ease of use of the reconÔ¨Åguration tool on average 1.78 (SD ¬º 1.31) on a scale from  3 to 3. Thus, the RG perceived the reconÔ¨Åguration tool as fairly easy to use.  3.3.  Situation awareness and mental workload  Results regarding situation awareness and mental workload are shown in Table 7. Although the possibility to reconÔ¨Ågure one‚Äôs own user interface was expected to enhance situation awareness, the RG did not outperform the CG regarding situation awareness (see Table 7). Unlike our assumptions, the groups did not differ signiÔ¨Åcantly with respect to mental workload. That is, the RG did not show signiÔ¨Åcantly lower mental workload ratings than the CG. Partici- pants‚Äô ratings of their mental workload were around four to six on a scale from one to ten, which suggests that they perceived their workload as not very high.  3.4. Additional analysis  As an additional analysis, duration of initialization (i.e., duration from starting the simulation until power is produced) was compared between the groups. For the Ô¨Årst task (start-up and practiced fault state), the RG needed 20.35 s on average (SD ¬º 17.92) and the CG 45.68 s on average (SD ¬º 18.47). This difference in (t(58) ¬º  5.39, duration of initialization proved to be signiÔ¨Åcant r ¬º .58 (Field, 2005; Cohen, p < .000) with a large effect size of average duration of initialization of the RG was 18.86 s (SD ¬º 11.72) 1992). For the second task (start-up and novel fault state), the CG 38.55 s (SD ¬º 14.80). Also this difference in mean and of initialization was signiÔ¨Åcant (t(65) ¬º  6.07, p < .000) duration of with a large effect size of r ¬º .60; Field, 2005; Cohen, 1992). Thus, reconÔ¨Åguration reduced the time needed until power was produced.  4. Discussion  In the present study, we took up the idea of individuation that tools such as user interfaces should be customizable (Hancock et al.,  Table 7 Mean and SD (in parentheses) of situation awareness and mental workload as a function of group and results of t-tests.

Scale from 1 (low/little) to 10 (high/greatly).  b  2005). We tested whether customization of user interfaces had the potential to enhance performance and user acceptance as well as situation awareness and reduce mental workload. Participants in the experimental group, the RG, were provided with a reconÔ¨Ågu- ration tool which allowed different reconÔ¨Åguration operations such as the discretization of continuous interaction elements or the duplication and removal of interaction elements. The RG trained and worked with the reconÔ¨Ågurable user interface while the CG trained and worked with a default user interface. First, results showed clearly that the RG committed fewer errors than the CG. Both during start-up and practiced fault state as well as novel fault state, the RG committed signiÔ¨Åcantly fewer errors than the CG and this proved to be a medium to large effect. The CG committed about twice as many errors than the RG. These Ô¨Åndings show the potential of reconÔ¨Ågurable user interfaces to support performance. Second, not only was performance supported by reconÔ¨Ågurable user interfaces but the interfaces also enhanced user acceptance. Participants in the RG rated perceived usefulness, perceived behav- ioral control and perceived intention to use signiÔ¨Åcantly higher than the participants in the CG. However, perceived responsibility and handling of task were not signiÔ¨Åcantly increased by the use of reconÔ¨Ågurable interfaces. In summary, participants learned to handle the complex task better with the reconÔ¨Ågurable interface and also subjectively liked the reconÔ¨Ågurable interface better than the CG. Third, results regarding situation awareness and mental work- load, however, were not in line with our assumptions. The RG did not outperform the CG regarding situation awareness nor mental workload. In general, performance is supposed to be good when situation awareness is good (Endsley, 1995b). Thus, situation awareness is expected to be linked to performance. In the present study, however, it seems that performance was good as such (in the RG) without the need of support by good situation awareness. Possibly, for the task at hand, the option to reconÔ¨Ågure was more critical for good performance than having high situation awareness. The Ô¨Åndings may also be explained by usage duration: The study lasted approximately 2 h in total of which approximately 25 min were reserved for the testing session. This usage duration may have been too short to build up and maintain high situation awareness, especially when using a novel system. As Endsley (1995b) argues, situation awareness ‚Äúis not necessarily acquired instantaneously but is built up over time‚Äù (p. 38). Further research may thus consider a longer usage duration. Another possibility is to consider reconÔ¨Åguration of the system parameters‚Äô visual representation (output elements; e.g., single- and multi-value displays and dia- grams) in addition to reconÔ¨Åguration of interaction elements of the user interface (i.e., input; cf. Weyers et al., 2012). ReconÔ¨Åguring output elements may enhance situation awareness since informa- tion can be displayed as preferred. Regarding mental workload, we expected the reconÔ¨Ågured interface to decrease mental workload of the RG. However, mental workload ratings did not differ signiÔ¨Å- cantly for the two groups. Maybe this result can be explained by the fact that mental workload ratings were on a rather low level for both groups. Thus, the reconÔ¨Ågurable interface could not decrease an already low perceived workload further. Another explanation could be that reconÔ¨Åguration led to an increased mental workload during the training session and was still on an increased level during the testing session. Although these Ô¨Åndings are promising with respect to the use of reconÔ¨Åguration, some limitations of this study need to be dis- cussed. Performance was assessed as the number and type of errors committed according to Hollnagel‚Äôs (1998) classiÔ¨Åcation. The latter represents one possible method of assessing performance, how- ever, future studies should explore other measures such as mea- sures for normal operation. Also, future research should assess the

Burkolter et al.  / Applied Ergonomics 45 (2014) 346e353  353  participants‚Äô mental model of the system at the beginning and the end of the study to compare possible differences and changes in the mental models of the RG and the CG. Furthermore, participants wereealthough students of applied computer scienceenovices and the process control task was unknown to them before the experi- ment. Also, their mean age was around 23 years. In view of these facts, the question arises to what extent similar Ô¨Åndings could be expected for more experienced operators or for operators with a different level of education? With regard to more experienced operators‚Äô beneÔ¨Åt from using the reconÔ¨Åguration tool, potential may be seen regarding the decrease of workload. ReconÔ¨Åguring a user interface and working with a reconÔ¨Ågured user interface may enhance performance by reducing workload. Also, further research may look into how operators work with the reconÔ¨Åguration tool when using it for a prolonged duration, e.g., whether they work on improving their own reconÔ¨Ågured user interface. Finally, signiÔ¨Åcance of the present Ô¨Åndings for practice is dis- cussed. ReconÔ¨Åguration presents opportunities to learning and performing in complex, technical systems. Individuation is assumed to increase job satisfaction, motivation, and positive affect through enhanced user control over the technical system (Fritzsche and Parrish, 2005 cited in Hancock et al., 2005). Furthermore, correspondence between user interface, mental model of the user, and physical system (cf. Wickens and Hollands, 2000) is believed to increase performance. The reconÔ¨Åguration tool may be used with a group of operators in the simulator to conÔ¨Ågure a user interface according to the needs of these operators. ReconÔ¨Åguration may also be employed for learning and training purposes (cf. Weyers et al., 2011). ReconÔ¨Åguring a user interface may help to enhance under- standing of processes and systems. However, despite possible opportunities, difÔ¨Åculties and risks with the use of reconÔ¨Åguration need to be considered as well. ReconÔ¨Åguration entails the risk that the reconÔ¨Ågured interface may not be optimal or even includes erroneous operations. Therefore, a correction function needs to be implemented to prevent errors as well as limitations as to what extent reconÔ¨Åguration is possible. Furthermore, research is needed to study long-term effects of reconÔ¨Åguration. Research needs to rule out the possibility that a user‚Äôs mental model becomes less differentiated over time, because the user may be prone to think in ‚Äúmacroprocedures‚Äù and less in speciÔ¨Åc procedures and operations. Thus, further research on reconÔ¨Åguration is warranted before possible use in practice. In conclusion, reconÔ¨Ågurable user interfaces seem to be prom- ising and the present Ô¨Åndings warrant further exploration of reconÔ¨Åguration. For instance, the potential of reconÔ¨Åguration for learning and training may be further investigated.  References  Ajzen, I., Fishbein, M., 1980.

s0003687013000914,"  Full-tree (FT), tree-length (TL) and cut-to-length (CTL) methods, and associated harvesting systems usually are applied in wood harvesting. These methods differ in relation to the technology utilised. The FT method is globally the most common method. FT harvesting means that the trees are felled and the stem, intact with branches, is initially transported to the roadside landing using a skidder. Delimbing and, if necessary, bucking are performed at the roadside. In the TL method, trees are delimbed immediately after felling, and then the intact stems are skidded to the roadside landing. The tree-lengths, in both methods, are then transported by tree-length trucks or trains to the central processing yard or wood- processing mill, where they are bucked into timber assortments. If the bucking is performed at the roadside terminal, the assortments are directly transported by short-wood trucks to the wood-  * Corresponding author.

The third method, cut-to-length, means that the trees are processed (delimbed and bucked) into timber assortments in conjunction with the felling operations. Then the assortments are extracted with forwarders to the roadside where they are piled to await secondary transport by short-wood trucks to the wood- processing mill. Each of the harvesting methods also has its speciÔ¨Åc features that depend on natural and production conditions, the technology used, and the share of manual operations in the overall process. Thus, depending on the level of mechanisation and the type of equipment used, all the identiÔ¨Åed harvesting systems can be divided into the following most typical groups in Russia (Gerasimov and Seliverstov, 2010):  1. Fully mechanised CTL harvesting: felling, processing (delimb- ing and bucking) with a harvester, and extraction with a forwarder: FM CTL (harvester √æ forwarder); 2.

Motor-manual FT harvesting: felling with a chainsaw, extrac- tion with a cable skidder, and processing with a delimber: FT (chainsaw √æ skidder √æ delimber).  The efÔ¨Åciency and functionality of a particular wood harvesting system depend on a number of characteristics. The economic beneÔ¨Åts can be evaluated by such indicators as labour, productivity and cost. Environmental indicators can include soil damage (the rut depth or the degree of soil compaction), damage to undergrowth or remaining trees, etc. The wood quality indicators are determined by evaluating the quality of the timber in accordance with the quality speciÔ¨Åcations in the customer contracts, as well as other quality requirements. Undoubtedly, work safety and ergonomics cannot be ignored when comparing different technologies. Wood harvesting has been associated with high accident risk due to the low level of mechanisation, especially with a fatal outcome; the latter has been estimated at 1.4 deaths per 1 million m3 cut in Russia (Gerasimov and Karjalainen, 2008). Recently, special attention has been paid to comfortable and safe working conditions in forest operations (Hanse and Winkel, 2008; Smidt, 2011; Synwoldt and Gellerstedt, 2003). This will make harvesting work more attractive to the young, and employment in a logging company more desirable. Er- gonomic indicators describing the work severity (noise and vibra- tion levels, visibility, etc.) can be used to evaluate the safety and comfort of the work (Hansson, 1990; Harstella, 1990). Some studies in ergonomics of logging operations have been conducted in Russia during the Soviet time (Byzov, 1985; Oblivin et al., 1988; Vasekin et al., 1991) and are still conducting today in Russia at Voronezh Forest Engineering Academy (e.g., Kondrashova, 2010; Posharnikov et al., 2012), Petrozavodsk State University (e.g., Kukelev and Ustinov, 2005; Sokolov, 2008; Sokolov et al., 2008, 2012; Syunev et al., 2009; Gerasimov et al., 2008) and some others (e.g., Korenevsky et al., 2009). A positive result of the mechanisation of harvesting work is the drastic reduction in serious accidents and injuries (Axelsson, 1998; Lefort et al., 2003; Potocnik et al., 2009; Sokolov et al., 2008). However, increasing mechanisation is posing new prob- lems. Operators of harvesting machinery are being afÔ¨Çicted by overload injuries to the neck, arms and cervical spine. The main causes of these injuries are probably excessive periods of sitting, excessive work intensity during work in Ô¨Åxed, ergonomically- inappropriate positions, and repetitive, short-cycle movement patterns. Moreover, the motor-manual harvesting systems, using chainsaws, choker settings and primitive cable skidders, still continue to be widely used in forest operations due to steep and wet terrains and the difÔ¨Åcult social-economic conditions in many countries, such as Russia. Due to the ergonomic feasibility of harvesting operations being a critical element for the develop- ment of wood harvesting, using a number of different harvesting systems, such as MM FT, FM FT, MM CTL, FM CTL and MM TL, the main objective of the study was to evaluate and compare the most applicable currently used harvesting systems in terms of ergonomics.  2. Material and methods  There is a need for a comprehensive approach towards the evaluation of ergonomic performance of harvesting operations  and the selection of the most appropriate technology for local conditions. To evaluate the efÔ¨Åciency of the harvesting methods currently used, a comprehensive Ô¨Åeld study (measurements) and personnel surveys (interviews) were performed in North- west Russia. The region was selected as the study region because its territory is very representative in terms of the wide range of harvesting machinery used and the fact that nearly all harvest- ing technologies employed in different natural conditions are typical for boreal forests. Harvested forest stands had not been thinned before the Ô¨Ånal felling. A typical study stand was of mixed tree age and species. The tree species included spruce (31% on average), pine (35%), birch (28%), and aspen (6%). The average stem volumes of the harvesting sites varied between 0.13 m3 and 0.64 m3 under bark with the average value 0.29 m3. The average growing stock of harvested stands was 150 m3/ha with tree density 520 trees/ha. Typical soils in the test areas were loam, clay loam, and sandy loam. The harvesting sites were on Ô¨Çat terrain (Gerasimov et al., 2012; Gerasimov and Seliverstov, 2010). The study was performed in 2007e2009 and involved 15 log- ging companies, which harvest 0.866 million m3/yr of wood with CTL, 0.935 million m3/yr with TL, and 0.385 million m3/yr with FT harvesting systems. The companies selected performed harvesting operations, applying all the harvesting systems mentioned using both Russian and foreign machinery. The following machinery was used in the wood harvesting systems studied (Fig. 1): track feller buncher (Timberjack 850), wheel purpose-built harvester (Tim- berjack 1270D, John Deere 1070D, John Deere 1270D, Valmet 901.3, Valmet 911.3), excavator-based harvester (Volvo EC210BLC), track cable skidder (TDT-55A, TLT-100), track grapple skidder (ML-136), wheel forwarder (Timberjack 1410D, Timberjack 1010D, John Deere 1110D, John Deere 1410D, Valmet 840.3), wheel grapple skidder (Timberjack 460D), and track stroke delimber (LP-30B), chainsaw (Husqvarna 254XP, Husqvarna 262), choker setting. Field research was carried out at 23 harvesting sites, the locations of which are shown in Fig. 2. The study involved Ô¨Åeld measurements and a personnel survey, with questionnaires for the staff and managers of the logging companies (Fig. 3).  2.1.  Field study  A common approach was used for the Ô¨Åeld data collection and processing. Different parameters that impact on the ergonomics and working conditions were directly measured at workplaces under actual working conditions: comfort of the cabin layout and seat, location of controls, operator‚Äôs body position, etc.; noise and vibration in the cabins and on chainsaw handles; the force needed to operate machine controls, etc. A measuring tape was used to measure a distance, a protractor e angles, a dynamometer e forces, a sound level meter e noise, a vibrometer e vibration, video recording e time. Altogether, about 130 different parameters were measured for 27 machines and 9 chainsaws (Table 1) according to valid national state ergonomic standards and international and Russian ergonomic guidelines (Frumkin et al., 1999; Gellerstedt et al., 1999; Peskov, 2004). The measured ergonomic parameters of harvesting machines are resulted in Annex 1. In order to evaluate individual har- vesting machines, six ergonomic groups were considered with 2e4 indicators in each group (Table 2). The measured ergonomic parameters from Annex 1 were participated in forming of er- gonomic indicators and groups depending on which factor of the working conditions they were used to evaluate). ‚ÄúControls‚Äù group (total of 56 measured parameters) consisted of four in- dicators: location and stroke of controls; force required to operate controls; hand-operated controls; foot-operated

The measured ergonomic parameters of chainsaws are resulted in Table 3. In order to evaluate chainsaws and choker setting, the single ergonomic group was considered with three indicators  (Table 2): noise based on 2 parameters; vibration with 12 param- eters and body posture. The results were then compared with the effective norms and standards, and on the basis of the degree of compliance with the stipulated values the parameters were assessed on a scale of 0e1. An integrated indicator was determined for each group/subgroup of parameters, the level of which enables the evaluation of the comfort of the seat or controls in general, vibration, etc. These in- dicators were further integrated into one parameter e the so-called work-severity rate (Frumkin et al., 1999):  I ¬º 7   6pmin √æ 6pmin   1  6√∞n   1√û  7√∞n   1√û   6  pi  (1)  !

The work severity rate can be valued from 0 to 6. A higher value means a higher severity of conditions of work. This permits direct comparison of working conditions at different workplaces. A higher severity rate repre- sents harder working conditions. Depending on this value, the working conditions were categorised according to as ‚Äúcomfort- able‚Äù, ‚Äúrelatively uncomfortable‚Äù, ‚Äúextreme‚Äù or ‚Äúsuper-extreme‚Äù according to Table 4. Further documentation for Ô¨Åeld study meth- odology per each indicator can be found in Gerasimov and Sokolov (2009).  2.2.  Personnel survey  Measurements enabled the evaluation of some aspects of the working conditions, but not all of them. Some conditions cannot be measured directly, since no reliable measurement methods or appropriate measurement tools are available. For example, it is difÔ¨Åcult to measure the aesthetic perfection of the machine or its separate elements. On the other hand, workplaces are occupied by people and each person perceives and evaluates their working conditions from their own perspective. Different people prefer different types of work and working conditions. This also inÔ¨Çuences a person‚Äôs choice of a profession, and can lead to a substantial difference between an objective survey of working conditions and  subjective evaluations obtained from personnel. Therefore, together with the Ô¨Åeld measurements, the authors performed opinion surveys among the workers. The surveys were carried out by means of questionnaires. The composition of the estimated factors and their grouping were determined in accordance with the structure of the general ergonomic requirements formulated by Frumkin et al. (1999). Totally 48 factors were assessed. Their composition, grouping, and the results of surveys are shown in Annex 2. The workers were asked to evaluate their working conditions. Each of the 51 workers interviewed (Table 1) was asked to appraise 48 working conditions on a scale of 1e6. Similar to the Ô¨Åeld measurements, factors were combined into Ô¨Åve groups: ‚ÄúMan-machine interaction‚Äù (4 estimated factors); ‚ÄúEngineering perfection of machinery‚Äù (15 factors); ‚ÄúWork intensity‚Äù (6 factors); ‚ÄúComfort in the workplace‚Äù (8 factors); ‚ÄúCapacity building‚Äù (8 factors); ‚ÄúDesign of machinery‚Äù (7 factors) (Table 5). The inte- grated indicator was derived for each group. A work-severity rate at each of the reviewed workplaces was thus determined from the interview data.  2.3.  Comparison of wood harvesting systems  The main objective of this study was to compare different wood harvesting systems rather than individual work phases. Each  Table 3 Results of ergonomic measurements for different work phases with chainsaw.

The task gets more complex when there is a need to decide which of the two machine systems is better from the ergonomics and safety viewpoints. It becomes necessary to select a principle, which would enable the summarisation of several work- severity rate values into one aggregated value. The HodgeseLeh- mann (HL) rule, based on the combination of Wald (W) and Laplace (L) rules, was used to resolve this problem (Eiselt and Sandblom, 2004; Gerasimov and Khlustov, 2001):  HL ¬º W √æ L  (2)  According to the Wald‚Äôs minimax principle (W), the best ma- chine system is the one where the highest work-severity rate from all the work phases in this system is at the lowest level:  W ¬º min max Iij  (3)  where, i e index number of the harvesting system; j e index number of the harvesting worker (machine operator, lumberjack, choker setter) in each harvesting system; Iij e integrated work- severity rate for each worker in each system. In other words, when two harvesting systems are compared, Ô¨Årstly, the work phases with the highest work-severity rate are identiÔ¨Åed within each system. The machine system where this rate is lower will be considered the best one. If the hardest working  Table 5 Grouping of the estimated factors in interviews.  Group  Operators  conditions in two systems appear to be equal, the second hardest work-severity conditions should be analysed, and so on. This helps avoid over-estimation of such machine systems where some work phases have very good working conditions and some others are very bad. If there is at least one work phase with ‚Äúextreme‚Äù or ‚Äúsuper-extreme‚Äù working conditions in a machine system or a harvesting method, this system or method can never be considered to be ergonomically perfect. In contrast to the Wald rule, the Laplace rule (L) takes into consideration each of the possible consequences of all possible solutions:  L ¬º max  √∞  √û  1=ni  Iij  (4)  X  in i harvesting  where ni e total number of harvesting workers system. Thus, their joint consideration W and L under the umbrella of the HodgeseLehmann rule makes it easier to avoid some problems with a subjective decision. Multi-criteria decision making with the HodgeseLehmann rule is used in many areas of engineering and business activities (e.g., Gerasimov and Khlustov, 1996; Kaklauskas et al., 2007; Zavadskas et al., 2008; Zavadskas and Turskis, 2008; Zavadskas and Ustinovichius, 2003; Das, 2009; Otieno and Anderson-Cook, 2006). Each alternative in multi-criteria decision making problem can be described by a set of qualitative and quantitative criteria, which usually have different units of measurement. The normali- zation aims at obtaining comparable scales of criteria values. The present paper is focused on introducing this method for decision making normalization for ergonomic evaluation of wood harvest- ing systems based on combined qualitative and quantitative in- formation about ergonomic indicators of individual machines.  3.

All three values of the work severity should be taken into account when making a decision to select a certain model of machine. Table 6 illustrates the main integrated indicators based on the measurements of studied models of ma- chines. Table 7 illustrates the main integrated indicators based on the personnel interviews. The basis for subdividing of the machines and systems into 3 classes (‚Äúcomfortable‚Äù, ‚Äúrelatively comfortable‚Äù and ‚Äúextreme‚Äù) was a category of works. Six categories of workload were highlighted by Frumkin et al. (1999) which cover the full range of possible work- (I ¬º 0e6). severity rates Each category has a comprehensive description of the qualitative and the numeral from I to VI. How- ever, in order to simplify statements and facilitate the under- standing the numeral categories of work were transferred to the verbal characteristics of working conditions (e.g., ‚Äúcomfortable‚Äù, ‚Äúrelatively comfortable‚Äù, ‚Äúextreme‚Äù, ‚Äúsuper extreme‚Äù).  3.1. Harvesting operations performed with wood harvesting machines  Five harvester models were studied during the Ô¨Åeld measure- ments. Fig. 4 shows the total average work-severity rate for  harvesters based on the measured data and personnel survey data, as well as the average values. Thus, for operators of Valmet 901.3 and John Deere 1270D harvesters the working conditions can be considered ‚Äúcomfortable‚Äù. For other harvester models, the working conditions can be considered as ‚Äúrelatively uncomfortable‚Äù; how- ever, the difference in work-severity rate for all the harvesters analysed was, in fact, insigniÔ¨Åcant. When reviewing the Ô¨Ågures, it is worth noting that the scale of the work-severity rate is opposite to the integrated indicators for measurements and personnel survey, i.e. the higher the rate, the worse the working conditions. Only one feller buncher model was analysed in the course of the study, speciÔ¨Åcally the Timberjack 850. This machine proved to be the best in the majority of the indicators evaluated. According to the measurement data, the working conditions of the operator for a Timberjack 850 feller buncher fell into the category of ‚Äúrelatively uncomfortable‚Äù, whereas based on the personnel survey, as well as according to the total work-severity rate, they were in the category ‚Äúcomfortable‚Äù. Four forwarder models were analysed in the course of the Ô¨Åeld study. The Valmet 840.3 forwarder gained lower scores for ‚ÄúCon- trols‚Äù (‚Äúlocation and stroke of controls‚Äù indicator) and ‚ÄúWorkplace‚Äù (‚Äúpedals‚Äù indicator). This was mainly explained by the fact that, similar to the harvesters of the same brand, the distance between  Table 6 Main integrated indicators of working conditions in measurements on a scale 0e1(worse-better).

Thus, the working conditions of the operator were considered ‚Äúcomfortable‚Äù for the Timberjack 1110D forwarder and ‚Äúrelatively uncomfortable‚Äù for the rest of the models. Equally, regarding harvesters, the difference in the work- severity rate was not statistically signiÔ¨Åcant. Later, two models of Russian-made track cable skidders were analysed, the TDT-55A and the TLT-100 manufactured by the Onezhsky Tractor Plant. Thus, the working conditions of the TLT- 100 skidder operators can be considered as ‚Äúrelatively uncomfort- able‚Äù, while in the TDT-55A skidder, they were ‚Äúextreme‚Äù. There was a signiÔ¨Åcant difference between the measurement-based and personnel survey-based severity rates of work. The second one appeared to be signiÔ¨Åcantly lower. Based on the measurement data, the TLT-100 working conditions were ‚Äúextreme‚Äù, and for the TDT- 55A they reached ‚Äúsuper-extreme‚Äù. Naturally, in such conditions only operators who do not perceive conditions as ‚Äúsuper-extreme‚Äù, thanks to their good adaptation skills, remain in the job. Other operators simply quit the work. This can be seen speciÔ¨Åcally from the results presented, since for this study, those operators with substantial work experience (over 2 years) with these machines were interviewed. Only one model of a wheel grapple skidder was speciÔ¨Åcally analysed, the Timberjack 460D. The main weaknesses of this machine were the following: conÔ¨Åned cabin, substantially high noise level and lack of visibility (visibility in the moving direction does not comply at all with the recommendations, because the forward ground visibility was more than 14 m). In addition, high level of repetitiveness should be noted. The operator‚Äôs working conditions with the Timberjack 460D skidder can be considered ‚Äúextreme‚Äù based on the measurement data, ‚Äúcomfortable‚Äù based on the personnel survey data, and ‚Äúrelatively uncomfortable‚Äù in general.  3.2. Harvesting operations performed with chainsaws and choker setting  Two chainsaw models, Husqvarna 254XP and Husqvarna 262, were analysed. The latter model was only used during felling, while the former was employed for all the work phases analysed. Time  parameters of the work cycle were measured, as well as noise and vibration parameters (Table 3). The weighted average of the acoustic pressure for all types of work was within the norms, provided hearing protectors were used. The allowable continuous vibration can be calculated from the effective vibration acceleration impacting the operator‚Äôs hands. Having compared the value obtained with the actual measured value, it can be concluded that the Russian standard requirements for vibration safety were not met for any operation, except for bucking in piles. When felling trees with a Husqvarna 254XP chainsaw, the operator had to spend, on average, 55% of the working time in uncomfortable body positions. This was the highest value in all of the types of job analysed. Uncomfortable positions involved the body tilted forward at great angles; the body weight leaned against half-bent legs, and sometimes head and body having to turned in order to monitor the tree. Since the Husqvarna 262 chainsaw has handles, the time spent in uncomfortable positions resulted in only 14% of the total working time. Uncomfortable positions were not as extreme as in the previous case. The weighted average of the acoustic pressure also turned out to be lower, due to the greater distance between the saw and the op- erator‚Äôs ears. Time spent in uncomfortable positions during delimbing was 31%. The uncomfortable positions involved the body tilted forward at great angles and the body weight leaned against half-bent legs. In many cases, the operator had to stand on one leg only, or on a stem or branches in an unstable position, etc. The weighted average of the acoustic pressure was the highest among all the operations analysed. This was due to the fact that, compared to other work phases, in delimbing, the chainsaw motor is the most frequently running at high RPM levels (66%). The last type of work, bucking in piles, is seldom used, and it is mainly applied in a combination of TL and CTL harvesting when skidding is carried out in two phases. First, tree-lengths are deliv- ered to the intermediate landing by track skidders. After bucking, the Ô¨Ånished assortments are skidded to the upper landing site by forwarders. On the one hand, this operation involved long periods of chainsaw idle time (73%), when the feller was measuring the assortments. On the other hand, it was also typical that during this operation the feller did not use the saw at all for signiÔ¨Åcantly long periods. Usually, the skidder delivered tree-length bunches to the roadside storage more slowly compared to the time required for bucking. Hence, the period of noise and vibration shortened sub- stantially. Therefore, bucking in piles was the only job among the work phases analysed where the standard for continuous vibration was met.

Y. Gerasimov, A. Sokolov / Applied Ergonomics 45 (2014) 318e338  327  All of the Ô¨Åve indicators considered, based on the personnel survey among loggers doing felling, delimbing and bucking, stayed within the range of 3e4 on a 6-point scale. These values further led to a work-severity rate of 3.91, which corresponds to ‚Äúrelatively uncomfortable‚Äù working conditions. On the other hand, based on the measured data, none of the work phases conducted with chainsaws, except for bucking in piles, complied with the vibration load standards. Taking into account that the work is performed outdoors all year round in various unfavourable weather condi- tions, the work-severity rate based on the measurements equalled 6, and the working conditions were considered as ‚Äúsuper-extreme‚Äù. Thus, the total work-severity rate, based on the two above- mentioned values was 4.96 (‚Äúextreme‚Äù conditions). This value was later used to compare the different harvesting methods. The results of the personnel survey among the choker setters, who worked with track cable skidders TDT-55A and TLT-100, are similar to the fellers, except for the engineering perfection of the machine, which was only 1.82 (Table 7). This means that choker setters often considered the machines, as well as the equipment used (cable, choker), as highly imperfect (Fig. 5). Hence, this affected their subjective evaluation of the work severity. This is why among all the work phases analysed, this job in particular had the highest work-severity rate value of 5.32, which corresponds to ‚Äúextreme‚Äù working conditions.  3.3. Wood harvesting systems  Fourteen different wood harvesting systems were compared based on the total average work-severity rate obtained for the single harvesting equipment using the HodgeseLehmann rule (HL). These systems include:   four FM CTL systems with wheel purpose-build harvesters and forwarders (systems 1, 2, 4, 5) and one system with the exca- vator harvester and wheel forwarder (system 3);  one FM FT system with the track feller buncher, wheel grapple skidders, and track processor (system 6);  one MM CTL system with wheel forwarder (system 7);  two MM FT systems with track cable skidders (systems 8e9);  two MM TL systems with track cable skidders and delimbers  combination of MM TL and CTL systems (system 10); (systems 11e12);  two FT systems as a combination of the overseas feller buncher, Russian cable skidders and delimbers (systems 13e14).  the wood  systems  harvesting  The comparative results for studied are presented in Table 8. According to the Ô¨Åndings presented in this study, FM CTL har- vesting performed with the ‚Äúharvester √æ forwarder‚Äù technology (harvesting system 1e5) and FT harvesting with the ‚Äúfeller buncher √æ wheeled grapple skidder‚Äù (harvesting system 6) appeared to be those that provided the best working conditions. The traditional Russian MM TL harvesting that employs a chainsaw and cable skidders and its various modiÔ¨Åcations (harvesting sys- tems 8e12) had the worst results in terms of ergonomics, work severity and occupational safety. Thus, when a motor-manual harvesting system is employed, the use of cable skidders should be as limited as possible, because, as a whole, they do not comply with the current ergonomic requirements.  4. Discussion and conclusion  Similar papers are published in the Nordic countries and Ireland for CTL harvesting (e.g., Synwoldt and Gellerstedt, 2003; Gellerstedt et al., 1999; Grevsten and Sj√∂gren, 1996; Hanse and  Winkel, 2008; Harstela, 1990; Sherwin et al., 2004; etc.), in New Zealand, Canada and the USA for FT harvesting (e.g., Bentley et al., 2002; Bentley et al., 2005; Golsse, 1994; Kirk and Sullman, 2001; Murphy and Oliver, 2011; Parker, 2010; Sirois and Smith, 1985; Smidt, 2011; Zerbe, 1979; etc.), also the EU-project ErgoWood (http://www.enfe.net/pberichte_e.htm) and its implementation project COMFOR (http://enfe.net/comforopen/comfor.htm). How- ever, no scientiÔ¨Åc reports concerning the comparison of ergonomic performance for wood harvesting systems have been found neither in Russia, nor other countries. The research method examined based on the HodgeseLehmann rule and the integrated work- severity rate of single machinery is perhaps the Ô¨Årst attempt to evaluate and compare the ergonomic performance of different wood harvesting systems. Multi-criteria decision making with the HodgeseLehmann rule was used in ergonomic evaluation of wood harvesting sys- tems. The method combined qualitative and quantitative infor- mation about ergonomic indicators of individual machines. Each alternative in our multi-criteria decision making problem was described by a set of ergonomic indicators and criteria. They are qualitative and quantitative, having different units of measure- ment and different optimization direction. The normalization of criteria values is needed in this problem with an aim to obtain comparable scales of criteria values. The present research was focused on introducing this method for decision making normalization. The results show an efÔ¨Åciency of the method due to taking into account many different factors, a large number of measurements, as well as a combination of measuring methods with questionnaires. The use of the HodgeseLehmann rule allows making a comparison of not only individual harvesting machines, but their systems too. The total work-severity rates for the machines and equipment studied were obtained in a Ô¨Åeld study and by interviews, and should be improved on in the future due to the study being con- ducted in only one region in Northwest Russia. Additional ergo- nomic factors have to be involved in severity rate estimations, such as temperature, humidity, ventilation, and carbon dioxide con- centration. When this approach can be used in other climate con- ditions, for example, tropical forests. Other types and models of applicable machinery, such as chippers, energy wood harvesters, loaders, etc., need to be taken into account due to the number of applicable harvesting systems (over fourteen studied systems appear in this paper) especially with respect to wood-to-energy systems. The results of the measurements obtained at the forestry harvesting works may be helpful in the evaluation of the ergonomic performance of single machinery within the similar harvesting methods and systems in other countries. However, the national or ISO-standards should have to use instead of the Russian national ergonomic standards. The further method development might be the increasing number of the estimated ergonomic factors. For example, the method should include the full range of the micro-climate factors such as temperature and humidity in different areas of workplace, the content of various contaminants in inhaled air, etc. The mea- surement of these parameters in the forest is associated with challenges and requires more time and labour, and the special equipment. In addition, these factors are highly dependent on external conditions that cannot be the same in different harvesting areas located far away from each other. For these reasons, some factors were excluded from the method used, although, of course, it is not desirable. But in spite of all the above, the results might be useful for forestry companies to justify the selection of harvesting technology and systems of machines based not only on technical and economic factors, but also on the working conditions of personnel involved.

s0003687013000938,"  Sustained attention is an important aspect of several professions involving public safety. Air trafÔ¨Åc controllers, cyber operators, un- manned aerial systems operators, TSA inspectors, and satellite imagery analysts (among many other professions) can encounter lapses in sustained attention, possibly due to the monotonous and sometimes boring nature of these positions (Frankmann and Adams, 1962; Nachreiner and Hanecke, 1992). Alarmingly, lapses in attention in one of these environments can have severe or even deadly consequences (Hawley, 2006). To combat this issue, we investigated a device that might be useful for monitoring operator sustained attention or vigilance. Currently, there is no tool that can directly measure operator performance or cognitive state in these environments, and any lapse is typically only noticed after a mistake is made. In addition, there are currently no automated systems that can do the tasks associated with these positions as well as human operators. Therefore, it could be extremely beneÔ¨Å- cial to Ô¨Ånd a device that can effectively monitor vigilance perfor- mance in real-time within an operational environment. Laboratory vigilance tasks have been extensively studied and show that during a task, operator performance tends to degrade  * Corresponding author. Tel.: √æ1 937 938 3609.

Vigilance tasks investigate the lapses of attention in these environments by examining the increasing number of critical signals missed over time (the decrement). This performance decrement has been repeatedly associated with decreased blood Ô¨Çow velocity in the right hemisphere (Hitchcock et al., 2003; Warm et al., 2009; Hollander et al., 2002; Schnittger et al., 1997). Deutsch et al. (1987) retrospectively examined 121 studies and found signiÔ¨Åcant hemispheric differences for cerebral blood Ô¨Çow velocity in frontal regions, further indicating that the right hemisphere plays a role in attention and vigilance, especially in the most demanding sustained attention tasks. The theory as to why this occurs is that the right frontal cortex is involved with the sustained deployment of attention, and that decreases in cortical activity (resulting in performance lapses) are simultaneously associated with decreases in metabolic activity in these brain re- gions, thus performance decreases covary with decreases in right cerebral arterial blood Ô¨Çow velocities (Hitchcock et al., 2003; Warm et al., 2009; Hollander et al., 2002). Blood Ô¨Çow velocity can be successfully monitored in real-time by a transcranial Doppler (TCD) sonography. This is a non- invasive technique to monitor cerebral blood Ô¨Çow velocities in the middle, anterior, and posterior intracranial arteries by using ultrasound signals (Warm et al., 2009). Unfortunately, the TCD procedure has several major drawbacks that make it extremely difÔ¨Åcult to use in many operational settings, except for medical  0003-6870/$ e see front matter √ì 2013 Elsevier Ltd and The Ergonomics Society.

For example, the TCD cannot track blood Ô¨Çow for all ages and races, the signal can be too noisy if not in a quiet environment with little movement from the participant, and participants complain that the device is uncomfortable to wear for long periods of time (Knecht et al., 1998). Therefore, Ô¨Ånding an alternative biofeedback device that can monitor operator vigilance in an operational setting is of interest. To combat the drawbacks of the TCD procedure and to Ô¨Ånd a possible alternative biofeedback tool for vigilance tasks, we inves- tigated the use of a portable and wearable eye-tracking device. Oculometric information from eye-trackers has been used in numerous studies that have observed oculomotor behavior changes that correlated to changes in visual task performance (e.g., Matessa, 2004; Salvucci, 2000; McIntire et al., 2011). Previous research in- dicates that these oculomotor changes occurred while participants performed a visual attention task similar to ours (Tsai et al., 2007). SpeciÔ¨Åcally, Tsai et al. (2007) found that eye blink data (such as blink frequency and duration) corresponded with task performance, and they concluded that the changes in the blink metrics were due to operator workload and fatigue induced by the task. Van Orden et al. (2001) also found that eye blink frequency and duration strongly correlated with performance on a visual tracking task and the changes in blink behavior were again attributed to increasing levels of fatigue during the task. In fact Stern et al. (1994) concluded after an extensive review of the literature that blink rate metrics are a robust measure of time on task-induced fatigue. Similarly, Hardee et al. (1986) and Dingus et al. (1987) developed a method called PERCLOS (percent of eye closure), which is derived from eye blink metrics, to detect drowsiness levels in drivers. Other research expanded the use of PERCLOS to detect changes in cognitive work- load and not just during fatigue (Kawashima et al., 1995; Marshall, 2007). Therefore, we hypothesize that eye blink metrics will be correlated with changes in performance during our vigilance task. In our study we will use a wearable eye-tracking system that could be easily implemented into an operational environment. This particular wearable system may be beneÔ¨Åcial compared to other on and off body eye-trackers because it requires very little if any cali- bration adjustments, which also lends itself to easily be instru- mented by the user himself instead of with assistance (Nevalainen and Sajaniemi, 2004). The tracker also has no difÔ¨Åculty tracking different colors of pupils that is commonly found in other systems (Smith et al., 2000). Also, compared to other passive trackers, this tracking system allows users to get up and move around freely (Nevalainen and Sajaniemi, 2004), which may be another necessary feature for use in an operational environment. The wearable eye- tracker is also not physiologically invasive like some coil systems that must be placed in the eye and can only be worn for very short periods of time (Houben et al., 2006; Nevalainen and Sajaniemi, 2004). Thus, the tracker used in this study is not as invasive as many other eye- tracking systems and conceivably can be worn comfortably for sub- stantially longer periods of time. Our study will also compare the oculometrics of blink frequency and duration with that of the TCD device in terms of its ability to correspond to changes in vigilance performance. We hypothesize that if oculometrics can detect changes in vigilance performance, they should also correlate with changes in blood Ô¨Çow velocity because changes in blood Ô¨Çow velocity have been repeatedly associated with performance. Finding eye blink parameters like frequency and duration that correlate with vigilance performance using this wearable eye-tracking system could be the next step in allowing biofeedback information of operator attention to be implemented into operational settings. A device that monitors operator attention and cues, alerts, or otherwise assists the oper- ators in their duties could lead to decreases in errors and accidents, and increases in public safety in these environments.  2. Material and methods  2.1.  Participants  A total of 19 civilian and active duty military personnel (16 males, 3 females) aged 19e41 years with a mean age of 26.89 years volunteered to participate in this experiment. Participants received $10/h of compensation for their time and travel. They were required to have normal utilization of both arms and legs and were excluded if they required eyeglasses for vision correction because the eye-tracker used in this study could not be worn with eye- glasses. However, people using contact lenses for vision correction were permitted to participate.  2.2.  Equipment  2.2.1.  Eye-tracker  Each participant was required to wear the Eye-Com (Reno, NV) alertness monitoring device during the vigilance task. The device consisted of two infrared (IR)-sensitive cameras and a linear array of IR-illuminating light emitting diodes (LEDs) mounted on a set of eyeglass frames. The wavelength of the LEDs was 840 nm. The cameras were angled upward toward the eyes and extracted real- time pupil diameter, eyelid movement, and eye-ball movement. The sampling frequency of the device was 30 frames per second. The tracker monitored blink frequency and duration by tracking the occlusion of the pupil by the eyelid. When 85% of the pupil was occluded by the eyelid the eyes were considered closed for a particular frame. To be considered a ‚Äúblink‚Äù for our analysis the pupil had to be occluded for 3 frames because median blink rates for alert individuals usually fall between 130 and 170 ms (Schleicher et al., 2008). If there were less than 3 frames in a row that indicated the eyes were closed it was just considered a bad data point caused by the tracker losing the pupil momentarily.  2.2.2.  Transcranial Doppler  The Sonara/tek (Conshohocken, PA) transcranial Doppler (TCD) unit was used to measure blood Ô¨Çow velocities in the middle ce- rebral arteries in both left and right hemispheres for each partici- pant. The Sonara device uses ultrasound waves to measure blood Ô¨Çow velocity. The Sonara system included an integrated 1500 touch screen color LCD display, integrated PC board, and hard disk for data management and display. The 4 MHz ultrasound probe frequency was selected for this experiment. The ultrasound probes were attached to a helmet and placed on the left and right side of the head at the participants‚Äô temporal window. The update rate for this system was 1.1013 Hz.  2.2.3. Vigilance task  Participants performed a static simulated air trafÔ¨Åc control task in which they monitored four jet Ô¨Åghters on a circular path divided into four quadrants, described by Funke et al. (2009). Each quadrant contained a triangular jet icon. The icons were presented randomly pointing either clockwise or counterclockwise along a circular ‚ÄúÔ¨Çight path.‚Äù The stimuli were presented on a standard desktop visual display from a comfortable viewing distance (approximately 1.5 feet) while the participant was seated in a non-adjustable computer chair. The participant was required to look for critical signals, which were cases in which one of the jets was pointing in a conÔ¨Çicting direction with the others; so they appeared to be on a collision course. When presented with a critical signal, the participants were to indicate this by pressing the space bar on a computer keyboard. The stimulus was displayed for 1000 ms. Performance efÔ¨Åciency was assessed in terms of the percentage of correct signals detected (percent hits). This variable was averaged every 10 min over the

Averaging over 10-min epochs was conducted because the critical signals were designed to appear at random from one trial to the next, but at a speciÔ¨Åc rate within 10- min segments of trials (Ô¨Åve percent of the trials within a 10-min epoch contained a critical signal). It is important to note that laboratory vigilance tasks are very sensitive. Therefore, certain precautions must be taken to ensure the integrity of the data and to ensure tight control over any environmental stimuli that might unduly alter attention and possibly their performance. Participants were in a room isolated from any noise and participants were required to wear earplugs. Light levels were maintained to be consistent throughout the experiment (normal overhead ofÔ¨Åce lighting) and glare from the lights onto the task screen was minimized as much as possible. Participants were kept away from any possible distractions including a view of the experimenters (separated with a half-wall), a clock or watch, or their cell phone. The experimenters were able to see the participant and what they were doing through the outward-facing nose camera of the eye-tracker, but the participant was not able to see the experimenters.  2.3.  Procedures  No study-speciÔ¨Åc procedures were performed without a written and signed informed consent. The rights of our participants were protected and they were treated in accordance with the institu- tional guidelines and in ethical accord with relevant professional standards. After the participants were consented and registered into the study, they received a verbal brieÔ¨Ång and PowerPoint presentation that described the vigilance task followed by two 5- min practice sessions. After the practice sessions, the participant was instrumented with the eye-tracker, TCD, and earplugs and required to complete the Ô¨Årst 40-min vigilance task session. Par- ticipants were asked to refrain from talking and making excessive movements as described by Tripp and Warm (2007). Afterwards, participants continued their normal duties for the day. For each of the next 3 data collection sessions, which occurred on different days with at least 24 h between sessions, the participants received the same instrumentation and completed the 40-min task but were not required to complete the training again. We ran participants the same time of day for all sessions when possible and all sessions were conducted during normal business hours. During the task, the participants‚Äô eye blinks were measured by the eye-tracker.  2.4. Data analysis  2.4.1. ANOVAs  Upon completion of testing, eye blink frequency and duration, blood Ô¨Çow velocity, and vigilance task metrics were averaged in 10- min increments (10, 20, 30, 40 min) per individual and per session and used as dependent variables in univariate repeated-measures analyses of variance (ANOVAs). Factors were Day (1e4) and Time  (10, 20, 30, 40 min). Statistical signiÔ¨Åcance tests were based on an alpha level of 0.05. Some of the participants elected not to complete all 4 data collection sessions (days) and some of the TCD data on various days was too noisy and not usable due to poor signal strength. As a result, a participant‚Äôs data was not included in analysis unless there were at least three sessions (days) of usable data. Proc Mixed in SAS was used to perform the repeated- measures ANOVAs. Satterthwaite-type degrees of freedom were used for all F-tests (SAS Version 9.2). To adjust for missing data Least squares means (LSMeans) were used since there were some instances where the TCD lost the signal once data collection was underway.  2.4.2.  Correlations  Next, each participant‚Äôs days were categorized as either a Decrement or No Decrement day depending on the percent hits performance. If the linear best-Ô¨Åt slope on a participant‚Äôs percent hits across the four temporal epochs on a given day was negative (i.e., performance decreased over time on task), the data day was considered as a Decrement. Days with positive slopes or zero  0.1 slopes (i.e., no performance decrease over time on task) were considered a No Decrement day. For each participant, variables  Table 2 LSMeans for ANOVAs.

were averaged across days at each time point, separately for Decrement and No Decrement days. Pearson partial correlations controlling for subject (same as ANOCOV with subject as a factor) were performed (separately for Decrement and No Decrement days) to relate percent hits performance and right and left cerebral blood Ô¨Çow velocities with the eye blink metrics.  3. Results  Results are segregated into the two types of analysis. First, we present the results for the day and time ANOVAs. Next, we present the results of the correlations for eye blink duration and frequency in relation to percent hits and cerebral blood Ô¨Çow velocity, comparing the Decrement and No Decrement groups.  3.1. Analysis for Day and Time  ANOVAs were used to compare the Day of testing and the Time on Task within each session, for each dependent variable. Table 1 shows percent hits, right and left cerebral blood Ô¨Çow velocity, right and left blink frequency, and right and left blink durations with the repeated-measures ANOVA results of factors Day (1, 2, 3, 4) and Time (10, 20, 30, 40 min). SigniÔ¨Åcant F-tests have p-value cells grayed. All ANOVAs used 16 participants. Table 2 shows the LSMeans for the ANOVAs. The Day of data collection had a signiÔ¨Åcant main effect only for left and right blink duration. Left blink duration and right blink duration was shorter for Day 1 than for the other days. SpeciÔ¨Åcally, blink durations in the left eye increased by 10% between Day 1 and Day 4 and increased by 11% in the right eye over the same time frame. Time on task had a signiÔ¨Åcant effect on all dependent variables. There was a main effect of Time on the percent hits (Fig. 1). For percent hits, the LSMean was 86% (SEM ¬º 4%) averaged across days the task and 75% (SEM ¬º 4%) for the Ô¨Årst 10 min of for the Ô¨Ånal 10 min.  Left and right blood Ô¨Çow velocity decreased signiÔ¨Åcantly with time on task (Fig. 2). The left hemisphere had and LSMean of 46.9 mL/min (SEM ¬º 2.3 mL/min) across the four days for the Ô¨Årst 10 min of the task and 44.9 mL/min (SEM ¬º 2.3 mL/min) for the last 10 min. The LSMean for the right hemisphere was 46 mL/min (SEM ¬º 2 mL/min) across the four days for the Ô¨Årst 10 min of the experiment and 44 mL/min (SEM ¬º 2 mL/min) for the last 10 min of the experiment. This equates to a 5% decrease in blood Ô¨Çow velocity for both the left and right hemispheres. Left eye and right eye blink frequency increased as the task progressed (Fig. 3). The LSMean for the Ô¨Årst 10 min of the task was (SEM ¬º 2 bpm) 16 blinks per minute (bpm) for the left eye and 14 bpm (SEM ¬º 2 bpm) for the right eye. The LSMean for the Ô¨Ånal 10 min of the task was 19 bpm (SEM ¬º 2 bpm) for the left eye and 18 bpm (SEM ¬º 2 bpm) for the right eye. This equates to a 19% increase in blinking rate for the left eye and a 29% increase in blinking rate for the right eye over the 40 min of the task. As the time on task progressed, left and right eye blink duration also signiÔ¨Åcantly increased (Fig. 4). The LSMean for the left eye changed by 24 ms from the Ô¨Årst 10 min of the task to the last 10 min, from 226 ms (SEM ¬º 10 ms) to 250 ms (SEM ¬º 10 ms). The right eye changed from 224 ms (SEM ¬º 10 ms) in the Ô¨Årst 10 min to 247 ms (SEM ¬º 10 ms) in the Ô¨Ånal 10 min. This Ô¨Ånding represents a 10% increase in blink duration over the 40-min task in the right eye and 11% in the left eye. Finally, we also found an interaction effect for Day and Time that was statistically signiÔ¨Åcant for right blood Ô¨Çow velocity (Table 1).  3.2.

relate percent hits (Table 3) and right (Table 4) and left (Table 5) cerebral blood Ô¨Çow velocities with right and left eye blink fre- quency and duration (signiÔ¨Åcant correlations have the cells of their associated p-values grayed). Fig. 5 through 9 displays the signiÔ¨Åcant partial correlations. If either the Decrement or No Decrement group‚Äôs correlation was signiÔ¨Åcant for a given variable, the corre- sponding correlation is displayed for comparison. In the No Decrement group, neither blood Ô¨Çow velocity, nor the eye blink measures of frequency or duration, correlated with per- formance (Table 3, right two data columns). In the Decrement group, right blood Ô¨Çow velocity and eye blink measures signiÔ¨Å- cantly correlated with percent hits (Table 3, left two data columns). Right cerebral blood Ô¨Çow velocity positively correlated with percent hits (Tables 3 and 4). Blood Ô¨Çow velocity in the right hemisphere was observed to decline in a similar manner to the percent hits performance metric in the Decrement group (Fig. 5). This effect was not found for the left cerebral blood Ô¨Çow velocity. Several of the eye blink metrics negatively correlated with percent hits but only in the Decrement group (Table 3). Right eye blink frequency (Fig. 6) negatively correlated with percent hits, again only for the Decrement group. Left eye blink frequency did not correlate with percent hits for either group. Next, right and left eye blink duration correlated negatively with percent hits (Fig. 7) in the Decrement group only. In other words, as percentage of hits decreased on the task, the blink duration for both eyes increased. The eye metrics of blink frequency and blink duration have signiÔ¨Åcant negative correlations with right cerebral blood Ô¨Çow velocity (Figs. 8 and 9; also Table 4). In both the Decrement and No Decrement groups, blink frequency and duration have a signiÔ¨Åcant negative relationship with right blood Ô¨Çow velocity, and this was true for both eyes. We observed decreases in right blood Ô¨Çow ve- locity across time that was coupled with an increase in blink duration and blink frequency. Left cerebral blood Ô¨Çow velocities were not signiÔ¨Åcantly corre- lated with any of the metrics in the Decrement group (Table 5). However, the correlations of left and right blink frequency and left blink duration were signiÔ¨Åcant in the No Decrement group. Spe- ciÔ¨Åcally, blink frequency increased in the No Decrement group as lCBFV decreased (Fig. 10). Blink duration in the left eye also increased as lCBFV decreased over time (Fig. 11).  4. Discussion  Given the sometimes monotonous environment found in the jobs of air trafÔ¨Åc controllers, cyber operators, TSA inspectors, un- manned aerial systems operators, and imagery analysts, Ô¨Ånding a method to monitor the sustained attention of these individuals could be beneÔ¨Åcial for reducing mishaps. One possible method lies in monitoring vigilance through an eye-tracking system. Employing a system that gives real-time oculometric feedback would allow preventative measures to be implemented when certain metrics reach a particular level that are likely to indicate vigilance lapses or subsequent performance decrements. The data suggests that in- formation about individuals‚Äô eye blinks could be useful for moni- toring vigilance.  4.1.  Eye blinks and performance  Our results indicate that the speciÔ¨Åc metrics of blink frequency and duration could be indicators of vigilance performance. In fact, the results from blink frequency for one eye and blink duration for both eyes suggested that as performance declined, participants blinked more often, and the blinks were held for a longer period of time, presumably leading to more missed critical signals (either due to the eyelids literally being closed longer and missing the stimulus signals, or simply attentional lapses; or some combination of the two). Consistent with our Ô¨Åndings, a previous vigilance study observed an increase of blink frequency as a function of time on task (Carpenter, 1984). Carpenter (1984) found an overall increase in blink rate of 43% over the course of the 2-h vigilance task (note that we found a roughly comparable 29% increase in right eye blink rates over a 40-min vigilance task). Also, CafÔ¨Åer et al. (2003) found that participants in their drowsy condition had an increase in blink duration compared to participants in their alert condition while staring for 20 min at a static picture. Similarly, Brookings et al. (1996) found that when their participants were concentrating, paying attention, and working hard on high-workload tasks their blink rates declined, but when workload levels decreased their  Table 3 Percent hits correlations.

blink rates were observed to increase. Finally, increased blink fre- quency and duration have been found in relationship to the vigi- lance decrement (Funke, 2011; Morris and Miller, 1996; Schroeder and Holland, 1968). Our Ô¨Åndings conÔ¨Årm this previous work and suggest that blink rates are related to performance on sustained attention tasks. We also have similar Ô¨Åndings to Van Orden et al. (2000) who found changes in blink duration and frequency corre- lates with changes in performance. The interesting part of this Ô¨Ånding is that Van Orden et al. (2000) used a continuous activity vigilance task. This differs from our task because participants do not just sit passively and wait for something that might happen but, instead something is always happening that requires sustained attention even though it is a simple and boring task. These similar conclusions from a discrete event task (our study) versus a near continuous task (Van Orden et al., 2000) could indicate that blink frequency and duration are important measures to monitor in tasks requiring sustained attention. Increases in blink frequency and duration are not only found during boring tasks similar to our vigilance task; this effect is also is similar to Ô¨Åndings from the fatigue literature (Morris and Miller, 1996; Sirevaag and Stern, 2000). Clinical sleep deprivation research has found that signiÔ¨Åcant deprivation leads to increases in eye blink frequency; researchers believe this may be due to the patients attempting to maintain wakefulness through increased oculomotor activity (Gray et al., 1995). These researchers also found that loss of attention without sleep deprivation caused an increase in blink rate, which could be more reÔ¨Çective of our Ô¨Åndings (i.e., blink rate increases indicate lapses in attention, not strictly levels of sleep-related fatigue). If this theory is true, it is certainly possible that our participants blink more frequently during a boring task in  an attempt to maintain alertness. In fact, some believe that eye blinks may provide useful information about overall central nervous system activation and fatigue levels (e.g., Sirevaag and Stern, 2000). It is interesting to note that we only found the increase in blink frequency for the right eye. We still believe that an increase in blink rate may indicate that there is a higher tendency to miss critical signals even though this is only supported by data in the right eye. While we can offer no deÔ¨Ånitive interpretation of this Ô¨Ånding that one eye appears to offer useful blink rate information over another, this may reÔ¨Çect asymmetries in facial motor nuclei and the associ- ated motor neurons resulting in differences in blink initiation timing and magnitude of closure Interestingly, such ocular-related asym- metries appear to be unrelated to and independent of other motor, sensory, functional, and/or biological asymmetries of which the most well-known is handedness (Kassem and Evinger, 2006). While this explanation likely only applies to a few participants it is much more likely that there was some data misreads by the tracker causing the differences. Our particular eye-tracker records a zero if the eyes are closed and a one if the eyes are open. Therefore, it is impossible to ascertain whether the tracker misread an eye being closed when it was actually open. During data processing we only recorded a blink if it was physiologically possible to blink in the amount of time recor- ded to try to control for this recording error as best as possible. However, future research would need to address this issue. We also observed an effect for day on blink rates. SpeciÔ¨Åcally, left and right blink durations were shorter as days of participation progressed. We interpret this Ô¨Ånding as a general practice effect because further examination of the data revealed that participants became slightly faster at identifying the critical signals as each day progressed, as is common in repeated-measures psychology ex- periments that collect data with many trials over extended periods of time (e.g., Bartels et al., 2010). Since performance got better over time (across days), and blink duration is conceivably related to performance (as an indicator of fatigue or arousal levels), it is not terribly surprising to have found this effect. In fact it indirectly supports our claim that blink rates are indicative of performance due to changes in cognitive arousal levels.  4.2.  Eye blinks and cerebral blood Ô¨Çow velocities  Vigilance performance is known to correspond with changes in right cerebral blood Ô¨Çow velocity (Hitchcock et al., 2003; Warm et al., 2009; Hollander et al., 2002); therefore, we hypothesized that if oculometrics can detect changes in vigilance performance, they should also be related to changes in blood Ô¨Çow velocities. The results supported this hypothesis, showing that right cerebral blood Ô¨Çow velocities (but not the left) signiÔ¨Åcantly correlated with  Decrement  No Decrement  X = Percent Hits O = Blink Frequency  Time (min)  P  e  r  c  n e  t  H  i  t  s  B  l i  n  k  F  r  e q u e n  c y  (  b  l  p  m  )  Right  r = 0.00  p = 0.9977  11  13  15  17  19  21  10  20  30  40  Right  r = -0.42  p = 0.0064  55  65  75  85  95  10  20  30  40  X  X  O X  O X  X  O X  X  X  O  O  O  O  O  Fig. 6.

our measured blink oculometrics. All oculometrics negatively correlated with blood Ô¨Çow velocity in the right hemisphere, and for both Decrement and No Decrement groups. More speciÔ¨Åcally, as cerebral blood Ô¨Çow decreased to the right hemisphere, there was an observed increase in blink frequency and blink duration, sug- gesting that blink oculometrics and right cerebral blood Ô¨Çow ve- locity are in some sense overlapping measures of vigilance levels. Another interesting Ô¨Ånding regarding right cerebral blood Ô¨Çow velocity was a signiÔ¨Åcant interaction between Day and Time. We can offer no deÔ¨Ånitive interpretation of these Ô¨Åndings, although it appears that rCBFV changed very little over time on the Ô¨Årst day, but dropped considerably over time on days two, three, and four,  especially for day three (see Fig. 2). While no subjective question- naires were given to verify our interpretation, we believe by day three, participants were very bored and tired of the task (due to its intrinsically repetitive and boring nature) and our results likely reÔ¨Çect this boredom occurring around the middle of the third session. The metrics are back to their normal averages by day four when compared to days one and two, probably because partici- pants were excited they were nearing their last day of testing (a common Ô¨Ånding in the arousal and fatigue literatures, in which participants sometimes ‚Äúperk up‚Äù for sessions near or at the end of testing which causes a similar statistical interaction) (e.g., McKinley et al., 2011).

5.  Conclusion  Changes in eye blink frequency and duration appear to correlate with changes in vigilance performance. These blink oculometrics also correlate with participants‚Äô right cerebral blood Ô¨Çow velocities, which provides support for these oculometrics as indirect mea- sures of vigilance performance from a well-researched and conÔ¨Årmed measure of vigilance (e.g., Hitchcock, et al., 2003; Warm et al., 2009; Hollander et al., 2002). Future research will be needed to assess the real-time effects of these oculometrics during vigi- lance tasks. Such studies will also need to expand these results by using alternative and more real-world relevant tasks. However, our results do suggest that using an eye-tracker in an Air Force-relevant task environment to detect changes in sustained attention could be beneÔ¨Åcial, and more research should explore this topic further. Employing an automated vigilance detection system in an opera- tional setting could allow preventative measures to be employed, perhaps by implementing a perceptual warning system or aug- menting human cognition through non-invasive brain stimulation techniques.

s0003687013000963,"  In the early 1960‚Äôs Chapanis and Safren1 (Chapanis and Safrin, 1960; Safren and Chapanis, 1960a,b) conducted one of the Ô¨Årst human factors and ergonomics (HFE) studies on medication safety. The researchers used the critical incident technique to examine medication errors. They identiÔ¨Åed a total of 178 medication administration errors over a period of seven months: (1) wrong patient, (2) wrong dose of medication, (3) extra unordered medi- cation, (4) medication not administered, (5) wrong drug, (6) wrong timing of medication administration, and (7) incorrect medication route. A range of work system factors contributed to medication  errors, such as failure to follow required checking procedures, and verbal or written communication problems. This study highlighted the importance of work system issues in medication safety. How- ever, it was not until the publication of the US Institute of Medicine report ‚ÄúTo Err is Human: Building a Safer Health System‚Äù in 1999 (Kohn et al., 1999) that HFE and its systems approach were recog- nized as critical for patient safety across all healthcare domains.2 Healthcare professionals, leaders and organizations understand the importance of HFE as a scientiÔ¨Åc discipline that can produce knowledge to redesign healthcare systems and processes and improve patient safety and quality of care (Carayon et al., 2013; Gurses et al., 2012b; Institute of Medicine, 2012; Leape et al., 2002; Pronovost and Goeschel, 2011; Pronovost and Weisfeldt, 2012). For instance, the World Health Organization curriculum on patient safety includes 11 topics, among which two are core to HFE: (a)  * Corresponding author.

The US Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) promotes an HFE approach to the design of health information technology (IT) (NRC Committee on the Role of Human Factors in Home Health Care, 2010, 2011) and has published a variety of guidance docu- ments on using HFE systems models to analyze patient safety events in healthcare delivery (Henriksen et al., 2008, 2009). Various IOM reports have called for the incorporation of HFE, and of sys- tems approaches generally, into health and healthcare research, design, and policy (Grossman et al., 2011; Institute of Medicine, 2001, 2004, 2006, 2012; Reid et al., 2005). Given the complexity of healthcare (Carayon, 2006), HFE in- terventions that do not consider issues across the whole system, including organizational factors, are unlikely to have signiÔ¨Åcant, sustainable impact on patient safety and quality of care. For instance, improving the physical design of a medical device or the cognitive interface of health IT is important; but without understanding the organizational context in which these technologies are used, workers may develop work-arounds, the tools may not be used safely, and health IT may be usable but not useful. Therefore, an HFE systems approach to healthcare quality and patient safety should include organizational HFE or macroergonomic considerations. We have proposed an HFE systems approach to address patient safety and other quality of care problems (see Fig. 1). The SEIPS (Systems Engineering Initiative for Patient Safety) model of work system and patient safety (Carayon et al., 2006b) is based on the macroergonomic work system model developed by Smith and Car- ayon (Carayon, 2009; Carayon and Smith, 2000; Smith and Carayon- Sainfort, 1989; Smith and Carayon, 2001), and incorporates the Structure-Process-Outcome (SPO) model of healthcare quality  (Donabedian, 1978). The SPO model of Donabedian (1978) is the most well-known model of healthcare quality. The integration of the work system model with this prominent model of healthcare quality increases the acceptability of the SEIPS model by the healthcare community. In this paper, we Ô¨Årst describe the SEIPS model of work system and patient safety and its research and practical applications. We then emphasize the principle of ‚Äòbalance‚Äô and focus on system interactions that need to be considered in order to make signiÔ¨Åcant progress in healthcare quality and patient safety.  2.  SEIPS model of work system and patient safety  Key characteristics of the SEIPS model include: (1) description of the work system and its interacting elements, (2) incorporation of the well-known quality of care model developed by Donabedian (1978), (3) identiÔ¨Åcation of care processes being inÔ¨Çuenced by the work system and contributing to outcomes, (4) integration of patient outcomes and organizational/employee outcomes, and (5) feedback loops between the processes and outcomes, and the work system (see Fig. 1).  2.1. Work system model of healthcare  Table 1 describes the elements of the work system and provides examples for each element of various work systems. Even if the elements are described separately, it is important to emphasize interactions between the work system elements (see further dis- cussion on system interactions in the section on ‚ÄúBalancing the work system for patient safety‚Äù). The SEIPS model is a dynamic model: any change in the work system produces changes in the rest of the work system.  Fig. 1. The SEIPS model of work system and patient safety (Carayon et al., 2006b).

Person  Tasks  Tools and technologies  Physical environment  Organization  DeÔ¨Ånitions  Example: ICU nurse  The individual at the center of the system can be a single individual (e.g., physician, nurse, patient) or can be a group of individuals (e.g., team, organizational unit).

In the initial description of the SEIPS model (Carayon et al., 2006b), the external environment was not explicitly stated. Given the major role of regulatory, profes- sional and consumer/patient groups in healthcare delivery, we have added the ‚Äòexternal environment‚Äô to the original version of the SEIPS model (see Fig. 1). This is in line with other HFE systems approaches that describe the impact of the external environment on the work system and actors in the system (Kleiner, 2006; Moray, 2000; Rasmussen, 2000). The external environment is comprised of extra-organizational rules, standards, legislation, and enforcement, as well as characteristics of the healthcare industry in general and the healthcare workforce (Karsh et al., 2006; Kleiner, 2006, 2008). In healthcare, the work system model can be used to describe the work of clinicians, other healthcare professionals, and care teams as well as patients and their caregivers (see Table 1). Clari- fying the ‚Äòperson‚Äô at the center of the work system has been another conceptual evolution of the SEIPS model. In the initial publication (Carayon et al., 2006b), the focus was on the healthcare profes- sional at the center of the work system; other ways of conceptu- alizing the person were brieÔ¨Çy described, such as the person as a team or the person as a patient. Over the years the SEIPS model has been further expanded to include these other ‚Äòpersons‚Äô at the center of the work system. Several examples of clinicians‚Äô work systems are described in the section on ‚ÄúWork system performance obstacles and facilitators‚Äù (see below). Examples of the SEIPS model for team-based care and patient ‚Äòwork‚Äô are provided below.  The person at the center of the work system can be a group of people such as healthcare teams. Similar to trends in other in- dustries, increasingly teams are proposed as a way to organize healthcare work and manage care processes to enhance healthcare quality and patient safety. For instance, AHRQ, collaborating with the US Department of Defense Patient Safety Program, has invested signiÔ¨Åcant resources in developing and implementing the Team- STEPPS program (Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, 2008). Another example of teamwork in healthcare is the patient- centered medical home model whose aim is to improve quality in primary care (Stange et al., 2010; Vest et al., 2010). The work system of the patient-centered medical home can be characterized as fol- lows (Wetterneck et al., 2012):   person: Members of the team include physicians, nurses, and other staff at the primary care clinic. The implementation of patient-centered medical home often relies on the hiring of nurse case managers whose primary responsibility is care co- ordination (Steele et al., 2010). Patients and families are also part of the medical home team.  tasks: Major tasks of the patient-centered medical home team include communication and care coordination.  tools and technologies: The team uses various health infor- mation technologies such as electronic health record and health information exchange systems to communicate and share patient information. Information technologies such as secure email messaging and web portals are often used by patients to communicate with healthcare professionals, i.e. physicians and nurses.  
P. Carayon et al.  / Applied Ergonomics 45 (2014) 14e25  17   physical environment: The physical layout of the physician practice needs to allow for team meetings and huddles.  organization: Organizational issues are critical for effective patient-centered medical home teams. Research by Nutting et al. (2012) on the patient-centered medical home describes how a new ‚Äòmental model‚Äô of physician practice organization is necessary for successful implementation of patient-centered medical home. In particular, they recommend a ‚Äòmeaningful care team approach‚Äô in which roles and contributions to the team are clearly outlined.  The primary person in the center of the work system can also be the engaged patient, e.g., a patient self-managing a chronic illness such as heart failure or diabetes and related health needs (e.g., diet, exercise). The patient is typically not the only person in the work system and often interacts with others such as family members and informal (lay) caregivers and healthcare professionals such as phy- sicians, home care nurses, or case managers, to carry out their ‚Äúhealth work‚Äù (Zayas-Caban and Brennan, 2007). One of many health work processes in this system is medication-taking in the home, where person factors could include patient knowledge, alertness, and pre- sent symptoms; task factors include the number of medications and their dosages; tools and technologies might be pillboxes and blood glucose monitors; organization factors include meal schedule and access to medications; and environment factors include lighting conditions and any distractions in the home. Relevant outcomes include health or disease outcomes such as disease progression as well as personal satisfaction, quality of life, and Ô¨Ånancial solvency.  2.2. SEIPS model as an extension of (SPO) of healthcare quality  the structure-process-model  The SEIPS model builds on the well-known SPO model (Donabedian, 1978) that includes structural, process and outcome measures of healthcare quality. Donabedian‚Äôs (1988) description of healthcare structure is rather limited with a focus on material re- sources (e.g., facilities, equipment), human resources (e.g., number and qualiÔ¨Åcations of staff) and organizational structure (e.g., orga- nization of medical staff, methods of reimbursement). We extended the SPO model and replaced the ‚ÄòStructure‚Äô by the work system. This improvement produces a more systematic approach to analysis and improvement of healthcare quality and patient safety. The consid- eration of all work system elements allows for a deeper and broader understanding of the factors that can contribute to healthcare quality and patient safety. Therefore, the range of possible solutions for improving healthcare quality and patient safety is wider.  2.3.  InÔ¨Çuence of  the work system on care processes  The inclusion of care processes in the SEIPS model Ô¨Åts with modern organizational concerns for quality improvement such as Total Quality Management and lean thinking. There has been a recent push for introducing lean thinking in healthcare (Toussaint, 2009). However, such approaches need to consider HFE and sociotechnical system aspects (Holden, 2011b; Joosten et al., 2009). According to Holden (2011b), lean thinking can be considered as an organizational change that produces (positive and/or negative) changes in work system design, which in turn affect healthcare quality as well as employee and organizational outcomes. Therefore, he recommends that lean applications in healthcare such as emergency departments would beneÔ¨Åt from an HFE approach by recognizing the contribu- tions of people (e.g., workers, patients) in the change process and considering people‚Äôs needs (e.g., worker need for control). The SEIPS model can, therefore, be a framework to ensure that process analysis and quality improvement efforts in healthcare integrate HFE issues.  Several examples of SEIPS studies of care processes are described below. These examples demonstrate how the work sys- tem can be used to describe care processes (Carayon et al., 2004): a care process can be considered as a series of tasks performed by individuals using various tools and technologies in a speciÔ¨Åc environment. The organizational conditions of the work system are represented in the care process through transitions between different individuals and their tasks, coordination and communi- cation across the process, and other temporal aspects of the process (e.g., scheduling of tasks). An important aspect of care processes is to understand how all of the work system elements interact and are organized over time; this goes beyond the mere (static) description of the work system. The temporal nature of care processes is important as healthcare tasks have all kinds of patterns; they may occur simultaneously, in parallel, or sequentially at different time scales (e.g., minutes, hours, days) (Carayon et al., 2012b).  2.4.  Patient outcomes and employee/organizational outcomes  In line with HFE and its double objective of worker well-being and system performance (Dul et al., 2012; International Ergonomics Association (IEA), 2000), the SEIPS model includes patient outcomes such as patient safety and other dimensions of healthcare quality as well as outcomes associated with healthcare workers and organizations. According to the SEIPS model, the objective is to design work systems that beneÔ¨Åt both patients and healthcare workers and organizations. Any healthcare system redesign should therefore achieve both types of beneÔ¨Åts. Many HFE applications in healthcare focus on the occupational safety and health of workers (Carayon, 2012), such as methods for reducing work-related musculoskeletal disorders of nurses (Nelson et al., 2006). This research is important, but needs to be extended to include impact on patient outcomes. Research by Trinkoff et al. (2011a, 2011b) shows that characteristics of nurses‚Äô work system such as high psychological and physical demands are related to adverse patient outcomes such as pneumonia deaths. This research is important as it demonstrates that well-known HFE work system variables (e.g., job demands) are related to adverse patient outcomes; therefore, improving healthcare work systems using HFE principles should produce beneÔ¨Åts for both patients and healthcare professionals.  2.5. Feedback loops between the process and outcomes, and the work system  Data on care processes, patient outcomes and/or employee and organizational outcomes can be used to identify problems and opportunities for redesigning the work system; this is a key feature of the feedback loops in the SEIPS model. These feedback loops indicate that changes in the work system can occur as healthcare organizations collect, analyze, and use process and outcome data. The impact of work system redesign can then be evaluated by examining their effect on care processes and outcomes. This rep- resents cycles of healthcare system design, implementation, and continuous improvement (Carayon, 2006; Carayon et al., 2011a). The SEIPS model is a dynamic model where work systems may adapt in response to different care processes and outcomes. The ‚Äòworkers‚Äô in the system, i.e. healthcare professionals and patients/ families, develop strategies to perform their tasks, sometimes in response to work systems that are not appropriately designed. For instance, in studies of bar coding medication administration (BCMA) technology implementation in pediatric hospitals, Holden et al. (2012, 2013, 2011b) found that, consistent with the feedback loops in the SEIPS model, staff nurses, as well as nursing leaders (Novak et al., 2013), altered the BCMA technology and the broader work system in order to achieve desired process and outcome changes.  
18  P. Carayon et al.  / Applied Ergonomics 45 (2014) 14e25  Strategies developed by healthcare workers when faced with work system obstacles include work-arounds and safety violations (Alper et al., 2012; Alper and Karsh, 2009; Halbesleben et al., 2010; Koppel et al., 2008). A systematic review of safety violations across all industries identiÔ¨Åed the following categories of variables as predictors of violations (Alper and Karsh, 2009): (1) individual characteristics (e.g., attitude toward compliance), (2) information or training (e.g., lack of knowledge of safety rules), (3) design to support worker needs (e.g., inadequate tools, low stafÔ¨Ång level), (4) safety climate (e.g., management ignoring violations), (5) competing goals (e.g., time pressure), and (6) problems with rules (e.g., outdated or impossible to follow rules). All of these variables in the work system are relevant in healthcare as described in a study of work-arounds in medication administration (Koppel et al., 2008). Understanding work-arounds and safety violations can provide important information on aspects of the work system that need to be redesigned to promote safe behaviors and enhance patient safety. Table 2 summarizes the various aspects of the SEIPS model that are of value to healthcare.  3. Research applications of the SEIPS model of work system and patient safety  The SEIPS model has been used by numerous healthcare re- searchers, professionals, and educators. Researchers have used the SEIPS model to study timeliness of follow-up of abnormal test results in outpatient settings (Singh et al., 2009), to examine the safety of EHR (Electronic Health Record) technology (Sittig and Singh, 2009), to evaluate ways of improving electronic communication and alerts (Hysong et al., 2009), to assess work system barriers and facilitators to the provision of outpatient pharmacy services (Chui et al., 2012), to improve patient safety for radiotherapy (Rivera and Karsh, 2008), and to characterize patient safety hazards in cardiac surgery (Gurses et al., 2012a). The SEIPS model has been adopted by patient safety leaders, such as Peter Pronovost from Johns Hopkins University (Pronovost et al., 2009). It also serves as the basis for the ‚Äúhuman factors paradigm for patient safety‚Äù developed by Karsh et al. (2006) that has itself been adopted by others (DeBourgh and Prion, 2012; Holden, 2011a, 2011b; Holden et al., 2011a). We have used the SEIPS model in our research to examine pa- tient safety in multiple care settings (e.g., Intensive Care Unit or ICU, pediatrics, primary care, outpatient surgery, cardiac surgery, tran- sitions of care) and to study the implementation of various forms of health IT (e.g., EHR, CPOE or Computerized Provider Order Entry,  health information exchange pump, tele-ICU).  technology, BCMA,  smart  infusion  3.1. Work system performance obstacles and facilitators  The design Ô¨Çaws in or incompatibilities between work system components cause clinicians to experience ‚Äòperformance obstacles‚Äô (anything that hinders clinicians from performing their job). In a mixed methods research study with interviews of 15 ICU nurses (Gurses and Carayon, 2009) and a survey of 272 nurses in 17 ICUs (Gurses et al., 2009; Gurses and Carayon, 2007), we identiÔ¨Åed 13 categories of performance obstacles that hinder ICU nurses from completing their tasks; the obstacles were related to one or more elements of the work system:   task: e.g., dealing with many family issues  tools/technologies: e.g., unavailability of necessary equipment in a timely manner  physical environment: e.g., workspace  organization: e.g., delay in getting medications from pharmacy.  insufÔ¨Åcient and poorly designed  We then used the SEIPS model to test the impact of performance obstacles on nursing workload, quality of working life, and quality of care using a structural equation modeling approach (Gurses et al., 2009). The survey data analysis shows that obstacles related to the physical environment, family-related issues, supply chain manage- ment (e.g., access to supplies, stock in patient rooms, access to pa- tient chart, delay in getting medications), and equipment-related issues affect ICU nurses‚Äô perceptions of quality and safety of care either directly or indirectly via their inÔ¨Çuence on workload (Gurses et al., 2009). These results are important as they provide information about the ICU nurses‚Äô work system factors that need to be addressed in order to improve their quality of working life as well as the quality and safety of care they provide to patients. Achieving this dual objective is key to HFE as described by Dul et al. (2012). Another recent study proposes that work system obstacles are actually the result of ‚ÄômisÔ¨Åt‚Äò between two or more work system elements (Holden et al., 2013). Similarly, we applied the SEIPS model in an outpatient surgery study to identify performance obstacles and facilitators (Carayon et al., 2006a, 2005b, 2005c). We distributed surveys containing open-ended questions to all clinical staff at Ô¨Åve surgery centers and asked them to identify performance obstacles and facilitators related to various stages of the outpatient surgery process (before,  Table 2 Value of SEIPS model to healthcare.

The performance obstacles and facili- tators reported by the outpatient surgery staff covered all work system elements: communication with patients and healthcare providers [task and organization elements], coordination [organi- zation element], time-related issues such as time pressure [task and organization elements], quality and availability of equipment and supplies [tools and technologies element], and noise [physical environment element] (Carayon et al., 2005b). Obstacles associated with the Ô¨Çow and coordination of patients‚Äô pre-operative clinical information posed the greatest concern to patient safety and were the target of the follow-up intervention (Schultz et al., 2007). In a recent study, we examined performance obstacles and fa- cilitators experienced by nurse care managers who coordinate care for patients after surgery and patients with chronic diseases during transitions from the hospital (Alyousef et al., 2012; Carayon et al., 2012a). This study focused on care coordinators‚Äô use of multiple health IT applications and identiÔ¨Åed performance obstacles in all of the work system elements:   person: health IT training and knowledge issues  task: issues with patient-related information processing and management (e.g., need for duplicate data entry in multiple health IT applications)  tools and technologies: slow response times  physical environment: limited physical access to computers  organization: organizational obstacles to the effective use of health IT such as delay in access to patient-related information.  technology design problems such as  An interdisciplinary group of researchers, including human factors and systems engineers, conducted a prospective, descriptive study to identify hazards to patient safety in the cardiac surgery perioperative period (Catchpole and Wiegmann, 2012; Gurses et al., 2012a; Pennathur et al., 2013). Based on the data obtained from 20 cardiac surgeries, a total of 58 categories of hazards were identiÔ¨Åed in all elements of the work system:   people: lack of professionalism  tasks: high workload  tools and technologies: poor usability  physical environment: cluttered workspace  organization: hierarchical culture and non-compliance with guidelines.  These studies point to the value of a systems approach to identify all aspects of the work system that can potentially affect patient safety. A deeper and broader HFE system analysis pro- duces a wide range of system redesign solutions to improve healthcare quality and patient safety (Catchpole and Wiegmann, 2012).  3.2. Work system impact on care processes  A key element of the SEIPS model is the focus on care processes that may be affected by the work system. The literature on healthcare quality focuses on care processes and patient outcomes, but has not paid sufÔ¨Åcient attention to the structural factors (work system) that can inÔ¨Çuence these processes and patient outcomes as well as employee and organizational outcomes. Therefore, our research can provide useful information on how to redesign work systems in order to improve care processes and subsequently, pa- tient outcomes. Because processes mediate the impact of the work system on outcomes in the SEIPS model (see Fig. 1), we have studied perceived process change as an indicator of success or failure of an intervention on the work system. This includes studies  of nurses‚Äô perceptions of the medication administration process before and after the introduction of BCMA technology (Holden et al., 2011a) and attending physicians‚Äô perceptions of how their cognition changed with a newly implemented CPOE/EHR (Holden, 2010). Our research has also examined the following care pro- cesses: ICU nursing medication management (Faye et al., 2010), the bedside rounding process in a pediatric hospital (Carayon et al., 2011d), and compliance with patient care guidelines in the ICU (Gurses et al., 2010, 2008). A proactive risk assessment (PRA) of the medication manage- ment process3 was conducted with nurses from an adult cardio- vascular ICU (Faye et al., 2010). The PRA consisted of two 2-h focus groups with nurses. In the Ô¨Årst focus group, nurses were asked to 1) review and add to a list of failure modes that the research team had gathered from their observations of the medication management process and interviews with nurses from the same unit, and 2) identify contributing factors of those failure modes (using the work system model). In the second focus group, nurses were asked to specify activities they complete to (1) recover from the failures and their contributing factors and (2) increase the quality and safety of their patients. The SEIPS model was displayed and explained to nurses during both focus groups to discourage them from blaming themselves or other healthcare professionals for failures. We also emphasized that system factors and interactions that are poorly designed may cause and contribute to failures during the medica- tion management process. Recently patient- and family-centered care has emerged as a key principle for quality and patient safety, in particular for vulnerable patients such as children (Institute of Medicine, 2001). Hospitalized children are more likely to be exposed to potentially harmful medication errors than adult patients (Kaushal et al., 2001). Family- centered rounds are proposed as a process for engaging parents and children and for identifying errors and other hazards that can harm children. During family-centered rounds, the interdisciplinary team of physicians, nurses, and other relevant healthcare professionals meet at the patient bedside to discuss the patient‚Äôs care and involve the active participation of the patient and family (Sisterhen et al., 2007). Implementation of family-centered rounds involves numerous changes in the work system. Using the SEIPS model, we identiÔ¨Åed work system obstacles and facilitators to family engagement in the rounding process (Carayon et al., 2011d). For instance, computer use can enhance family engagement by allow- ing parents to review data on the computer screen. On the other hand, the placement of the computer may create a barrier between the physician describing the child‚Äôs clinical status and the parents. Other work system factors such as communication style of the physician, involvement of nurses, and position of the team mem- bers were identiÔ¨Åed as facilitators to family engagement. Obstacles included size of the team present in the child‚Äôs room and use of medical jargon by the healthcare team. These data on work system obstacles and facilitators were then used to develop strategies for improving family engagement in family-centered rounds (Kelly et al., 2013). Research using the SEIPS model has also examined the process of compliance with patient care guidelines in the ICU (Gurses et al., 2010, 2008). A range of work system factors can contribute to increased ambiguity regarding the implementation and use of evidence-based guidelines, and therefore, affect compliance with  3  The ICU nursing medication management process is comprised of seven steps: (1) assessing patient, (2) obtaining a medication, (3) administering a medication, (4) monitoring/reevaluating patient, (5) educating patient and/or family during the ICU stay, (6) educating patient and/or family in preparation for discharge, and (7) conducting nurse-to-nurse handoff.  
20  P. Carayon et al.  / Applied Ergonomics 45 (2014) 14e25  the guidelines. For instance, ambiguity in the task element may be manifested in the lack of clarity of who is completing which guideline tasks and when. Ambiguity in the organizational element relates to role deÔ¨Ånition, authority, and accountability for the per- formance of the guideline. These studies show the importance of identifying the multiple work system elements that contribute to effective, efÔ¨Åcient, and safe care processes. Health services research produces information on the relationship between care processes and outcomes; how- ever, this is not sufÔ¨Åcient to identify what needs to be changed or redesigned to improve outcomes (Berwick, 2005). Health services research studies can, therefore, beneÔ¨Åt from complementary research using the SEIPS model.  3.3. Impact of health IT on work system, care process and patient safety  In many countries, health IT is seen as a signiÔ¨Åcant means of improving healthcare quality and patient safety (Bates, 2000; Bates and Gawande, 2003). However, the evidence for the quality and safety beneÔ¨Åts of health IT is limited (Chaudhry et al., 2006; Institute of Medicine, 2012). The lack of attention to HFE in the design, implementation, and use of health IT contributes to limited success of health IT, the failures to implement and sustain health IT, and safety problems linked to health IT (Karsh et al., 2010). Our research has examined the impact of health IT on work system and patient safety in a variety of domains: BCMA technology in hospital settings (Carayon et al., 2007b; Koppel et al., 2008), smart infusion pump technology in a hospital (Carayon et al., 2010; Schroeder et al., 2006; Wetterneck et al., 2006), and CPOE/EHR in ICUs (Carayon et al., 2011c; Hoonakker et al., 2010, 2011; Wetterneck et al., 2011). We have also used the SEIPS model to classify self- reported facilitators and barriers to physicians‚Äô use of imple- mented CPOE/EHR (Holden, 2011c) and to improve the design of a clinical decision support for primary care physicians (Hoonakker et al., 2012). Some of this research is described here. According to the SEIPS model, when new health IT is imple- mented, it transforms the work system structure, thus altering care processes and then inÔ¨Çuencing outcomes such as patient safety (Holden, 2011a). We therefore studied how nurses in pediatric hospitals perceived three medication management processes before and after BCMA implementation (Holden et al., 2011a). Nurses‚Äô perceptions of the accuracy, usefulness, consistency, time efÔ¨Åciency, ease of performance, and safety of medication processes were signiÔ¨Åcantly different following BCMA implementation compared to perceptions prior to BCMA. BCMA‚Äôs incorporation into the work system had varying effects: some processes were perceived to improve whereas others were perceived to worsen. Another study of BCMA use by hospital nurses showed that, even a few years after implementation, a range of work system factors affected the safe use of the BCMA technology (Carayon et al., 2007b). For instance, interruptions by patients, families, and phy- sicians often occurred while nurses were administering medica- tions using the BCMA technology; this can produce distractions and medication administration errors. Nurses also identiÔ¨Åed various work system factors that promoted the safe use of BCMA technol- ogy such as need for verifying patient identity and medication. In a study of the implementation of CPOE/EHR in four ICUs of a large hospital, we assessed the impact of the technology on the work system, the medication use process and errors, and various patient and employee outcomes. Results of our study show that ICU physicians tended to be less satisÔ¨Åed and accepting of the CPOE/ EHR technology as compared to ICU nurses (Carayon et al., 2011b, 2011c; Hoonakker et al., 2010). Furthermore, satisfaction with CPOE/EHR did not change over time for ICU physicians, but  improved signiÔ¨Åcantly for ICU nurses (Hoonakker et al., 2013a). While the CPOE/EHR technology seemed to negatively impact nurses‚Äô and to a lesser extent, physician and mid-level provider perceptions of certain aspects of communication (e.g., timeliness) 3 months after implementation as compared to 6 months before implementation, by one year after implementation these percep- tions returned to the same level or higher level as before technol- ogy implementation. These results demonstrate that an HFE systems approach needs to examine the impact of a change such as a new technology for all user groups or stakeholders. In addition, it is important to assess the temporal and dynamic aspects of system changes as indicated by our longitudinal analysis of the quality of communication (Hoonakker et al., 2013a). In this analysis, communication timeliness deteriorated 3 months after imple- mentation of the technology, but then improved and was found to be signiÔ¨Åcantly higher 12 months after implementation. We also found an increase in certain medication error types after imple- mentation, namely duplicate medication order errors (Wetterneck et al., 2011). The SEIPS model was used to analyze causes of the increased errors and we found issues with team communication as well as suboptimal EHR interface and clinical decision support alert design. Holden (2011c) used categories of the work system to describe factors that facilitated or impeded physicians‚Äô use of CPOE and EHR for inpatient and outpatient care. Facilitators and barriers spanned six categories of user attributes including knowledge about CPOE/ EHR and motivation, four technology attributes such as speed and usability, Ô¨Åve organizational/support factors such as technical support and time allowance, and four environment factors such as physical space and wireless connectivity. In other analyses, Holden (2010; 2011a) assessed physician perceptions about technology- related changes in processes and outcomes that might inÔ¨Çuence their use and non-use of CPOE/EHR. SEIPS research on health IT conÔ¨Årms the systemic and temporal consequences of the introduction of technology on the entire work system and care processes. Assessing the impact of technology on the work systems of various users is critical for understanding the systemic consequences of the technology. This can help to clarify the beneÔ¨Åts and challenges associated with the technology for different groups of users. Some user groups may beneÔ¨Åt more from the technology than others; this information is important for managing the sociotechnical change process and anticipating any acceptance problems. In addition, SEIPS research has conÔ¨Årmed the need to look at the short- and long-term consequences of tech- nology. For instance, short-term negative consequences of tech- nology implementation may disappear over time as the technology design and integration improved. The impact of health IT on the work system is not a linear process that unfolds over time; it is more like a journey in which the work system changes and adapts, and the person adapts to the work system as well (see section below on ‚ÄúBalancing the work system for patient safety‚Äù).  4. Practical applications of the SEIPS model of work system and patient safety  The SEIPS model can be used by HFE researchers and practi- tioners to introduce HFE to healthcare leaders and clinicians. The model, highlighting the social and technical system elements and their interactions that can inÔ¨Çuence processes and outcomes, helps expand healthcare professionals‚Äô thinking. Instead of taking a micro-level approach focusing on the individual, healthcare pro- fessionals now have a tool to help them take a macro-level systems approach to solving problems and enhancing healthcare quality and patient safety.  
P. Carayon et al.  / Applied Ergonomics 45 (2014) 14e25  21  The SEIPS model of work system and patient safety represents a major tool to introduce and promote HFE in healthcare; it has been used by numerous healthcare researchers, professionals and edu- cators. Because the SEIPS model is based on the work system model, it allows the various domains of HFE (cognitive, physical and organizational ergonomics) to be integrated and combined. This systems approach is necessary to understand complex patient safety issues (Carayon, 2006). The SEIPS model is the conceptual framework for a range of HFE tools and methods used to evaluate healthcare work systems and processes and their impact on healthcare quality and patient safety, such as survey questionnaire (Carayon et al., 2005a; Hoonakker et al., 2010, 2011), observation methodology (Carayon et al., 2005d; Carayon et al., 2007b), interviews (Carayon et al., 2006a; Gurses and Carayon, 2009), and proactive risk assessment of healthcare processes (Carayon et al., 2011e; Hundt et al., 2013; Wetterneck et al., 2009, 2006). Additionally, the SEIPS model can be used to make sense of data during data analysis, even if it was not used as a framework while collecting the data. For example, when analyzing incident data from an error reporting system, the SEIPS model can be used to group the incidents into different processes (e.g., direct patient care vs. indirect patient care processes) or outcome types (e.g., patient- vs. employee-related). It can also be used to categorize the contributing factors of the incidents into the Ô¨Åve work system el- ements. This helps healthcare organizations take a systems approach to identifying the root causes of errors rather than only blaming the person who committed the error. The SEIPS model can be used by healthcare organizations to (1) analyze patient safety events (e.g., root cause analysis), (2) analyze high-risk care processes, (3) anticipate the potential safety conse- quences of sociotechnical changes such as the introduction of a new medical device or EHR technology, and (4) enhance health sciences curricula. Root cause analyses (RCA) are conducted to investigate safety events. RCA teams can use the work system model to systematically consider all possible work system factors that could have contrib- uted to the sentinel event and discover that a ‚Äòroot cause‚Äô is unlikely to be discovered. The work system model can be a guide when asking questions about the event:   who was involved [Person]  what were they doing [Tasks]  what tools/technologies were they using [Tools/technologies]  where did the event take place [Environment]  what organizational conditions contributed [Organization]  the  to  event?  Some care processes may be identiÔ¨Åed as high-risk processes that need to be redesigned. The SEIPS model can be used to conduct a process risk analysis to ensure that all factors contributing to the vulnerabilities or failures in the process are systematically consid- ered and assessed. We have conducted proactive risk assessments of intravenous (IV) medication administration (Wetterneck et al., 2006), ICU nursing medication management (Faye et al., 2010), and patient transfer from surgery to the ICU (Hundt et al., 2013). Proactive risk assessment methods can be used to evaluate risks in current processes as well as to anticipate risks that (could) occur with modiÔ¨Åcations in care processes associated with sociotechnical changes (Carayon et al., 2011e). The SEIPS model has also been used in educational and training activities related to HFE and patient safety. For instance, a graduate- level certiÔ¨Åcate in patient safety was developed at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and organized to teach HFE and the SEIPS model to students in various disciplines, including industrial and systems engineering, population health sciences, medical physics, nursing, and pharmacy (Karsh et al., 2005). The SEIPS model is also the core of the curriculum for the short course on HFE and patient safety that has been taught annually at the University of Wisconsin- Madison since 2004. The week-long short courses have been attended by more than 400 healthcare professionals and manu- facturers/vendors engineers to learn about the basics of HFE and HFE applications to patient safety and health IT. Finally, the SEIPS model is used to teach third-year medical students about systems- based practice and analyzing errors and undesirable patient out- comes from a systems perspective as part of the patient safety curriculum at the University of Wisconsin.  5. Balancing the work system for patient safety  Understanding how the design and implementation of the work system can improve patient safety requires not only an assessment of speciÔ¨Åc aspects of the work system, but more importantly a deep understanding of work system interactions (Waterson, 2009; Wilson, 2000). According to Wilson (2000), the goal of HFE is ‚Äúto understand the interactions themselves in order to design the more diffuse, complex, and multi-faceted interacting system‚Äù (page 563). The SEIPS model proposes an HFE systems approach to healthcare quality and patient safety; therefore, we need to understand in- teractions between work system elements and their inÔ¨Çuence on care processes, patient outcomes, and employee/organizational outcomes. These system interactions are at the core of the Balance Theory of Smith and Carayon (Smith and Carayon-Sainfort, 1989; Carayon and Smith, 2000).  Once all of the system factors that are related to the event have been identiÔ¨Åed, the sequence of events can be mapped in the form of a process that integrates the various system factors. We have con- ducted this type of analysis for a Ô¨Åctitious case of wrong site surgery (Carayon et al., 2004). In the Ô¨Åctitious case, we created a process map that described the various steps of the process (from surgical site identiÔ¨Åcation to the surgical process) while also considering all work system elements. Using the HFE systems approach advocated by the SEIPS model, one can identify a range of work system factors that contribute to wrong site surgery: information conveyance and ultimate (mis)documentation (task), delayed and inaccurate docu- mentation (task) by the surgeon‚Äôs nurse in the patient‚Äôs record (tool/ technology), and communication with the patient and other pro- viders in a noisy environment at an organization where residents were involved in surgery, not solely the surgeon ‚Äúfamiliar‚Äù with the case. All of these issues negatively affected and were affected by people e both the patients and clinicians.  5.1.  Redesigning healthcare systems through balancing  The Balance Theory proposes that the individual elements of the work system be designed according to well-known HFE principles (Carayon et al., 2007a). The Ô¨Årst step is to eliminate obstacles in the numerous work system elements. As described above, research has clearly shown that many different work system elements are per- formance obstacles and affect patient safety, employee safety, and healthcare quality in a range of healthcare settings, workplaces and situations. Eliminating obstacles is critical; but this approach is not sufÔ¨Åcient, and in some cases, not feasible. For instance, our research on ICU nurses shows that patient characteristics are key perfor- mance obstacles; ICU patients are very sick and complex and create multiple demands for ICU nurses. Eliminating this obstacle is not feasible; other elements in the work system need to be addressed to mitigate the negative impact of this obstacle. Therefore, a com- plementary approach examines balance in the work system.  
22  P. Carayon et al.  / Applied Ergonomics 45 (2014) 14e25  Two approaches to balancing the work system have been pro- posed: (1) compensatory balance and (2) overall system balance (Carayon and Smith, 2000; Smith and Carayon-Sainfort, 1989). Compensatory balance in the work system is achieved when one positive element ‚Äòcompensates‚Äô for negative elements in the work system. Overall system balance is achieved if the overall combi- nation of positive and negative elements produces more beneÔ¨Åts than problems for system outcomes (e.g., patient safety and worker well-being). Using the SEIPS model, we examined sources of motivation and satisfaction of tele-ICU nurses (Hoonakker et al., 2013b). Tele-ICU nurses use different health IT applications to each monitor up to 50 patients located in different remote ICUs. Data from interviews with 50 tele-ICU nurses in 5 tele-ICUs showed that their work motivation and satisfaction were related to all elements of the work system. The nurses derived most motivation and satisfaction from the challenging aspects of their tasks, the physical working condi- tions, and the organization, in particular the teamwork in the tele- ICU. However, elements of the work system also reÔ¨Çected sources of dissatisfaction such as lack of physical activity (environment) and lack of acceptance by some ICUs (organization). Overall, each element of tele-ICU nurses‚Äô work system contained both positive and negative characteristics. For example, with regard to their tasks, tele-ICU nurses described the low job content of some tele- ICU tasks such as documentation and data collection, but also often talked about the interesting task challenges in their job. This is an example of compensatory balance as described by the Balance Theory (Smith and Carayon-Sainfort, 1989). Tele-ICU nurses mentioned positive work system characteristics more frequently than negative characteristics. This may be an indication that their work system is overall well-balanced with more sources of satis- faction than sources of dissatisfaction.  5.2. Active and adaptive role of workers  The individual at the center of the work system is inÔ¨Çuenced by the work system, but also inÔ¨Çuences the rest of the work system. When we examine the work system, we tend to focus on identi- fying system factors that either facilitate or hinder performance (performance facilitators and obstacles) and system factors that increase stress (job stressors) or increase satisfaction and motiva- tion. See section above on ‚ÄúWork system performance obstacles and facilitators‚Äù. Workers are inÔ¨Çuenced by work system elements, and therefore react and adapt to the work system (e.g., changing their work methods to adapt to the new technology). As described above, one example of adaptive behavior is the work-arounds created by workers to achieve their job despite performance ob- stacles and poorly designed work systems (Halbesleben et al., 2008; Holden et al., 2013; Koppel et al., 2008). It is also important to recognize that workers adapt their work system; they can play an active role in their work system. For instance, Weir et al. (2011) showed how physicians and nurses began to use a computerized patient documentation system as a communication tool. This is an example of how workers adapt a tool (i.e. computerized patient documentation) to perform tasks (i.e. communication) not considered in the functional design of the tool. This example of the active role of workers in using technology is in line with the structurational model of technology by Orlikowski (1992). The active role of workers in their work system is also a key element of the resilience engineering approach (Woods and Hollnagel, 2006). Workers develop strategies to adapt or respond to demands of the current situation (Paries, 2011); resil- ience is, therefore, characterized by four capabilities: (1) knowing what to do, (2) knowing what to look for, (3) knowing what to expect, and (4) knowing what has happened (Hollnagel, 2011).  The two roles of the person at the center of the work system, i.e. person inÔ¨Çuenced by the work system and person inÔ¨Çuencing the work system, are not separate. They can, for instance, be integrated through the concept of job control or autonomy. Worker adaptation can be fostered by a work system that allows workers to exercise control and be autonomous. In turn, a work system that allows for worker control and autonomy produces positive employee and organizational outcomes, such as reduced stress and improved satisfaction and motivation (Carayon, 1993; Frese, 1989). For example, interruptions in healthcare can have a negative impact on the persons being interrupted, such as loss of attention (Grundgeiger and Sanderson, 2009) and stress (Baethge and Rigotti, 2013), but work systems that support job control may facilitate the ability of workers to decide how to respond to interruptions (Rivera- Rodriguez and Karsh, 2010).  5.3. HFE systems approach to redesign  A range of technological, organizational, and structural in- terventions is being implemented to improve healthcare quality and patient safety. For instance, as described above, there has been a major push to implement health IT to improve the efÔ¨Åciency, effectiveness, and safety of patient care. These sociotechnical and structural changes can beneÔ¨Åt from the SEIPS model as any change in one element of the work system (e.g., implementation of a new technology) will affect the other elements of the work system. This can be accomplished, for example, through a proactive risk assessment as described in the section above. It is important to recognize that we cannot anticipate all possible work system changes that occur after the implementation of a new technology (e.g., BCMA or EHR) or a new work organization (e.g., patient- centered medical home). The feedback loops in the SEIPS model are important in this regard as they highlight the need for regular assessment of the work system and its impact on processes and outcomes. As described above, the feedback loops are also impor- tant for continuous improvement. An HFE systems approach to healthcare redesign as suggested by the SEIPS model addresses the multiple work systems of importance for the speciÔ¨Åc healthcare quality or patient safety problem to be addressed. Oftentimes the focus is on the work system of a single individual; optimizing the work system for one individual may have negative consequences for the work system of other individuals. An example of the problem with this narrow approach is the issue of resident duty hours. Long hours for medical residents affect patients (e.g., errors related to resident fatigue) as well as the residents themselves (e.g., burnout) (Ulmer et al., 2008). Improving the work system of residents, such as their work schedule, can reduce serious medical errors (Landrigan et al., 2004) and enhance resident well-being. However, this work system redesign may have negative effects on the work system of attending physicians who supervise the medical residents. Attending physi- cians may have to work longer hours to compensate for the shorter hours of residents; they may then experience fatigue and stress that can lead to errors. Therefore, it is important to deÔ¨Åne the right level and scope of the system in order to address healthcare quality and patient and employee safety.  6.  Conclusion  The SEIPS model has been used successfully to introduce and promote HFE to healthcare researchers, professionals, and educa- tors. Knowledge of speciÔ¨Åc HFE topics (e.g., teamwork, usability, coordination, physical stressors, resilience) is necessary to study healthcare quality and patient safety issues. We advocate that this specialized HFE knowledge focusing on speciÔ¨Åc aspects of the work  
P. Carayon et al.  / Applied Ergonomics 45 (2014) 14e25  23  system can have signiÔ¨Åcant impact if it takes into account the entire work system. If the broad work system is not clearly considered, this specialized HFE knowledge is at risk of either examining the wrong problem or using the wrong approach to solve the problem. We encourage HFE researchers and practitioners to embrace the proposed HFE systems approach to increase the relevance and signiÔ¨Åcance of their effort targeted at improving healthcare quality and patient safety. Future research on the SEIPS model should explore work system interactions and their impact on healthcare quality and patient safety (Waterson, 2009). This research should help answer the question of how to redesign healthcare systems and processes to achieve ben- eÔ¨Åts for both patients and healthcare workers. We also need to develop methodologies and measures for assessing balanced work systems that can produce beneÔ¨Åts for all stakeholders.

s0003687013001117,"  Mental models can be thought of as internal constructs that explain human behaviour (Wickens, 1984; Kempton, 1986). The notion has been associated with many domains over the last 20 years, including domestic (Kempton, 1986), transport (Weyman et al., 2005) and military (Rafferty et al., 2010). Mental Models have formed the basis of strategies to improve interface design (Carroll et al., 1987; Williges, 1987; Norman, 2002; Baxter et al., 2007; Jenkins et al., 2010), to promote usability (Norman, 2002; Mack and Sharples, 2009; Jenkins et al., 2011; Branaghan et al., 2011; Larsson, 2012), and to encourage sustainable behaviour (Kempton, 1986; Sauer et al., 2009; Lockton et al., 2010) amongst many others. In 1986, Kempton described two distinct ‚Äòforms‚Äô of mental models of thermostat function that were prevalent in the population of that time. He proposed that the form of model held, could result in signiÔ¨Åcant variations in the amount of energy consumed due to home heating, by promoting different patterns of manual thermostat adjustment. Currently in the UK, 25% of carbon emissions are from domestic customers, 58% of which is due to domestic heating. The UK has legislated to cut 80% of greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 (Climate Change Act, 2008). Since Kempton‚Äôs study, almost three decades have passed and technology has  * Corresponding author.

It seems appropriate, therefore, to explore if Kempton‚Äôs (1986) shared theories can still be identiÔ¨Åed, and if so, to ques- tion if they remain relevant to design strategies targeted at combatting climate change. The term ‚Äòmental model‚Äô is used in different domains to mean different things (Wilson and Rutherford, 1989) and even within a domain, can be used to describe internal constructs that differ signiÔ¨Åcantly in terms of content, function or perspective (Richardson and Ball, 2009; Revell and Stanton, 2012). The form of mental model descriptions may have similarities to the way other types of models (e.g. process models or logic models) that do not depict internal constructs, are represented, resulting in confusion when interpreting outputs. SpeciÔ¨Åcity in the type of mental model is considered essential for commensurability when conducting research (Norman, 1983; Wilson and Rutherford, 1989; Bainbridge, 1992; Revell and Stanton, 2012). The authors ask the reader to bear the extended clariÔ¨Åcation of the way the term is used to this paper. The intention is to allow sufÔ¨Åcient understanding to determine the relevance and applicability of the Ô¨Åndings presented. This paper refers to mental models in three different ways: 1) in terms of its function; 2) in terms of its source, and; 3) in terms of its individuality. In terms of function, the deÔ¨Ånition most Ô¨Åtting is a ‚Äúdevice model‚Äù. Kieras and Bovair (1984) adopted this terminology to describe a mental model held by a user of how a device works. It includes a set of conceptual entities and their interrelationships (Payne, 1991). In this paper, the device of interest is the home heating system, and we seek to describe the conceptual entities and  0003-6870/$ e see front matter √ì 2013 Elsevier Ltd and The Ergonomics Society.

Device models, as a type of mental models, may be incomplete, inaccurate, and inconsistent (Norman, 1983). The authors believe that understanding where omissions, inaccuracies and inconsistencies occur in users device models of home heating, could provide insights into how to reduce energy consumption resulting from non-optimal operation. In terms of its source, this paper adopts Norman‚Äôs (1983) deÔ¨Å- nition of a ‚ÄúUser Mental Model‚Äù(UMM). He describes this as ‚Äúthe actual mental model [of a target system] a user might have‚Äù, that can only be gauged by undertaking observations or experimenta- tion with the user. In this paper we are seeking the model of the home heating system held internally by a user. As we cannot access this model directly, we have adopted a method appropriate to our aims to gain data to describe the user mental model. In terms of the individuality of mental models, we also refer to Kempton‚Äôs (1986) ‚Äòshared theory‚Äô. A ‚Äòshared theory‚Äô is derived by an analyst through the identiÔ¨Åcation of similarities in separate UMMs of individuals. These individuals are within a social group, who may share similar types of individual goals. A ‚Äòshared theory‚Äô differs from concepts such as ‚Äòshared‚Äô or ‚Äòteam‚Äô mental models that refer to shared knowledge structures within a team or group who are working towards group goals (Richardson & Ball). The beneÔ¨Åt of identifying shared theories of home heating, is broader reach when targeting strategies, to combat climate change, at individuals within the home. The 2 shared theories identiÔ¨Åed by Kempton (1986) were described as ‚Äòvalve‚Äô and ‚Äòfeedback‚Äô. Users with a valve shared the- ory, considered changes in the set point of their thermostat to be controlling the intensity of heat in their furnace, with the onus on the user to ensure a comfortable home temperature. Users with a feedback shared theory, considered their responsibility merely to select the desired thermostat set point. The thermostat would maintain comfort in the home by controlling the boiler operation period, in response to measurements of house temperature. Kempton (1986) referred to this latter theory as an ‚Äòamateur theory‚Äô of home heating, as it is a simplistic version of the actual way the heating system works. Kempton (1986) described how different shared theories may predict different behaviour patterns of ther- mostat set point adjustment. He discovered that holders of valve theory, had a unique behaviour characteristic absent in those holding feedback theory. At night, valve theorists regularly set the thermostat back to below normal comfort levels, which Kempton (1986) described as ‚Äònight set back‚Äô. Kempton (1986) proposed that despite the valve theory being less accurate than the feedback theory, this behaviour characteristic was likely to result in greater energy savings overall. Since Kempton (1986), additional shared theories of thermostat function have been proposed in the literature such as ‚ÄòTimer‚Äô (Norman, 2002) and ‚ÄòSwitch‚Äô (Peffer et al., 2011). Users holding the timer theory are thought to select greater values of set point, when longer periods of boiler operation are desired. Those holding the switch theory are thought to use the thermostat merely as an on/off switch. Both of these theories assume the user, not the system, is responsible for maintaining a comfortable house temperature. Norman (2002) and Peffer et al. (2011), do not refer to studies which informed these types of shared theory, nor do they describe distinct behaviour characteristics which may inÔ¨Çuence energy consumption. When investigating current user mental models of home heating, the authors therefore consider it relevant to deter- mine if these, or new shared theories of home heating, could be identiÔ¨Åed. Understanding how resulting shared theories associate with energy consuming behaviour could provide insights to inform novel approaches to reduce consumption. The reader may question if Mental Models need to be accurate or is it sufÔ¨Åcient that they are effective. Depending on context and  the speciÔ¨Åc user behaviour being considered, what is considered ‚Äòeffective‚Äô will vary. Kempton 1986 described how a faulty mental model of home heating control could lead to more energy efÔ¨Åcient behaviour, than a more accurate model. Norman (1983) contends that designers and instructors should ensure a ‚Äòfunctional‚Äô (not necessarily accurate) mental model to enhance user interaction with a system. Norman (1986) emphasises that the appropriateness of the user‚Äôs underlying model of a system is essential when troubleshooting, as the user is able to derive possible courses of action and possible system responses. Kieras and Bovair (1984) concluded that for very simple devices or procedures, there will be little value in providing a device model to users. Manktelow and Jones (1987) warn that systematic errors may result from an inappropriately simple mental model. So, taken together, the au- thors conclude that for simple procedures, simple devices or sys- tematic errors that have minor consequences, a ‚Äòfunctional‚Äô, simpliÔ¨Åed or even lack of mental model, may be effective. For more complex systems or procedures, where the need for trouble- shooting is likely, or if the consequence of systematic errors is signiÔ¨Åcant (as in the case of non-optimal home heating during an energy crisis), a more accurate user mental model may be needed for the effective use of devices. Hancock and Szalma (2004), emphasised the importance of qualitative methods in revealing user intention in a way that can inform the development of design principles. Flyvbjerg (2011) ar- gues that rich data gathered from detailed, real life situations can provide meaningful insights, that could not be gained from context-independent Ô¨Åndings. Virzi (1992), when conducting research into usability, found 80% of problems, including the most severe, are detected with the Ô¨Årst 4e5 subjects, illustrating how key insights can be gained with very small samples. Hancock et al. (2009) also argue that ideographic case representations are increasingly relevant for the design of humanemachine systems, as advances in technology begin to focus on exploiting individual differences. Supporting these sentiments, this paper describes the results from an intergroup case study of home heating control, focussing in detail on 3 individual case studies taken from a pool of 6. The intention of this paper is to: 1) Demonstrate the existence of distinct mental model descriptions of the functioning of present day UK home heating systems, that differ signiÔ¨Åcantly from actual functioning. 2) Seek evidence of Kempton‚Äôs (1986), Norman‚Äôs (2002) and Peffer et al.‚Äôs (2011) shared theories of thermostat function in the case study group, and 3) discuss the present day relevance of Kempton‚Äôs (1986) valve and feedback models of ther- mostat function, to design strategies targeted at combatting climate change. Additional implications and the limitations of the study are also discussed.  2. Method  2.1.  Participants and setting  The case study group was non-randomly selected and comprised mainly overseas postgraduate students with families, new to the UK, who resided in semi-detached university owned accommodation in Southampton, UK. Participants arrived in their accommodation at the start of September 2011 and used the central heating system during the autumn and winter months. South- ampton has an oceanic climate, with cool winters (temperatures typically below 5  C). The accommodation, home heating devices and levels of insulation were matched, so that variations in mental model descriptions could be attributed to characteristics of the participant, rather than the environment. The layout of the home heating devices and speciÔ¨Åc models used are shown in a diagram in Fig. 1. The Participants were recruited by letter, email and  
K.M.A . Revell, N.A . Stanton / Applied Ergonomics 45 (2014) 363e378  365  shared theories. The resulting method devised by the authors was a semi-structured interview that included a paper-based activity whereby the participant represented their device model in a con- crete diagram form. For pragmatic application of mental models research, Revell and Stanton, 2012, emphasised the importance of accuracy in the capture and representation of internal constructs. This accu- racy requires the description of the mental model to reÔ¨Çect its source (in this study, the user of home heating systems), rather than assumptions by the recipient (e.g. the analyst). The risk of bias as a means of causing inaccuracy in mental model research, and the need to take pains to minimize bias is well documented in the literature (Rouse and Morris, 1986; Wilson and Rutherford, 1989; Bainbridge, 1992; Richardson and Ball, 2009; Revell and Stanton, 2012). Revell and Stanton (2012) developed a ‚Äòtree-ring‚Äô method in order to identify risk of bias when conducting mental models research, resulting in an adaptable framework (presented in table format). This framework required speciÔ¨Åcation of both the risk of bias and the type of knowledge structure, to aid commensurability (see Revell and Stanton, 2012, for an example of the tree ring method applied to Kempton (1986) and Payne (1991) plus the resulting table). The tree-ring method (Revell and Stanton, 2012) was applied to the approach devised for this study, and amendments were made to the data collection and analysis process in response to identiÔ¨Åed bias. The risk of bias identiÔ¨Åed through the tree ring method (Revell and Stanton, 2012) related to: 1) The background experience of both the analyst and participant, 2) The social expectations and means of communica- tion of both the analyst and participant, 3) The structure of cognitive artefacts used in the interview, and 4) The method of analysis of cognitive artefacts.

Table 1 allows readers to gauge the scope of efforts to promote accuracy in the capture of the UMM in the mental model description produced.  2.3. Dynamics of  the interview  The interviews were undertaken in March 2012, in a library cafe at the University of Southampton, to comply with the re- quirements of the risk assessment. The informal, familiar setting helped place subjects at ease. Interview durations were approxi- mately 1 h, but varied depending on the level of detail provided by the participant, between 45 min and 1 h 25 min. Interviews were recorded and transcribed by an independent transcription service. The interview comprised 3 main parts; 1) Background of partici- pant, 2) Self report of user behaviour, and 3) Mental model of device function. For a full explanation of the development and examples of outputs and interview template, please see Revell & Stanton (Under Review). In brief, part one covers the participants previous experience with home heating devices, determines if they have any formal training that may inform an ‚Äòexpert‚Äô un- derstanding the system, and captures the terminology they use when discussing the heating system in their home. Part two uses standard questions, probes and scenarios to help build up a dia- gram of ‚Äòtypical use‚Äô of the participants heating system during a week. The Ô¨Ånal part, uses questions and follow on probes directed  Fig. 1.

Permission was sought from the Faculty Ethics committee prior to contact and Research Governance was arranged. The participants that agreed to take part, were all from warm countries where centralised home heating devices are uncommon. This user group characteristic, whilst not originally sought by the authors, ensured minor experience of other home heating devices. This beneÔ¨Åts the mental model descriptions of home heating systems, by making them more closely aligned to the speciÔ¨Åc home heating devices installed, rather than previous experience by the participants of other home heating devices. In- sights from this case study could therefore use the speciÔ¨Åc design and layout of the setup as a starting point for energy saving strategies.  2.2. Data collection  The authors adopted a pragmatic worldview to their research. Whilst a postpositivism worldview is suggested by the objective to verify Kempton‚Äôs (1986) shared theories of home heating, the au- thors ensured their data collection method allowed interpretations of the data beyond this scope. It was important to the authors that alternate shared theories or unique UMMs could be revealed. This would allow further understanding of people‚Äôs mental models of home heating function to be gained, that could inform design based strategies (amongst others) for reducing energy consumption. A method adapted from Kempton (1986) and Payne (1991) was developed to these ends. Payne (1991) described ‚Äòshared theory‚Äô device models in a concrete diagrammatic form that the authors believed better communicates misunderstandings of function to design practitioners, than textual or non-deterministic schematic representations. Kempton (1986, 1987) used in depth interviews and analysed the transcripts using metaphorical analysis (devised by Lakoff and Johnson, 1981). He provides recommendations on the interview process and example questions and probes speciÔ¨Åc to home heating systems. From this, an interview approach could be developed to access content that allowed the analyst to identify

The diagram is built up using post-it notes containing the participant initiated terminology, as the analyst probes the participant to describe the relationship they exist between the components. Concepts are linked by drawing lines between the post-it notes with a pen (see Fig. 2 for an example of resulting output). To gain insights into cause and effect, and rules of oper- ation, participants were asked follow-on probes such as ‚ÄúHow does the boiler know when to come on/off‚Äù and ‚ÄúWhat would happen if you turned the thermostat to its maximum setting?‚Äù. Participant responses to these probes were represented on the diagram using arrows and text (Fig. 2). Following completion of the diagram, the analyst paraphrased each component, link and rule depicted, so the participant was could verify if this repre- sented what they imagined (marked with a smiley) or if they were uncertain this reÔ¨Çected what they really imagined (marked with a question mark). Participants were given the opportunity throughout the interview to amend the diagram to better reÔ¨Çect what they thought. These participant veriÔ¨Åed diagrams from part 3 of the method, represent the device topology and causal model of device function, which De Kleer and Brown (1983) consider fundamental to mechanistic mental models. The form of the veriÔ¨Åed description is similar in form to a ‚Äòconcept map‚Äô. They differ from simple concept maps as they contain written de- scriptions of rules and variables to enhance understanding of the users ‚Äòcausal model‚Äô. This output is considered by the authors to reÔ¨Çect the device model held by the user, of their existing home heating system. Wilson and Rutherford (1989) made the point that the outputs analysts capture when seeking a mental model is distinct from their actual mental model (an internal construct). Throughout this paper, that authors therefore refer to the partic- ipant veriÔ¨Åed diagram as their mental model description of home heating.  2.4. Analysis of outputs  These user veriÔ¨Åed mental model descriptions, and further ev- idence from the interview transcripts, formed the basis of discus- sion to determine aim 1; ‚Äú if distinct mental model descriptions of thermostat function, that differ signiÔ¨Åcantly from the actual func- tioning of UK heating systems, can be identiÔ¨Åed with present day UK heating systems‚Äù. To determine if the shared theories described by Kempton (1986, 1987) and others, are evident in the case study  Fig. 2. Participant A‚Äôs output from the paper-based activity, which formed the basis for analysis.  group, the interview transcripts were also examined. As the approach was designed with reference to the style and content of questions described by Kempton (1986, 1987), the interview tran- scripts from the intergroup case study could be examined to Ô¨Ånd evidence of responses that met Kempton‚Äôs (1986) criteria of either a feedback or valve shared theory. To categorize data from the interview transcripts systematically, according to Kempton‚Äôs shared theories, a reference table was developed (see Table 2). Kempton (1986, 1987), provided extended descriptions of valve and feedback model types. These descriptions were content analysed, identifying 4 distinguishing themes: 1) User Behaviour; 2) Thermodynamics; 3) Cause and Effect, and 4) Sensing/Control. For each of these themes, sub-themes with ex- amples of participant responses considered (according to Kempton, 1986, 1987) evidence of a particular theory, are shown in Table 2. The authors were then able to systematically compare the meaning of participant responses in the inter-group case study to those in Table 2, to determine if evidence of Kempton‚Äôs (1986; 1987) shared theories could be found. The following process was adopted when analysing the tran- scripts, to aid reliability.  1. Examining Sections 2, 3 and 4 of the interview transcript (self- report of behaviour, response to scenarios and device function), the type of responses by the participant were coded to separate ‚Äòmeaningful responses by the participant‚Äô from ‚ÄòconÔ¨Årmation of interviewers paraphrase‚Äô. The meaningful responses formed the pool for analysis. 2.Each response in the pool for analysis was coded by the main themes in Table 2. An ‚Äòother‚Äô category was used for responses that fell outside of these themes. 3.Using Table 2, each response was evaluated as evidence of Kempton‚Äôs (1986) shared theories. Whilst Norman (2002) and Peffer et al. (2011) did not provide sufÔ¨Åcient descriptions to produce entries in Table 2 for ‚ÄòTimer‚Äô and ‚ÄòSwitch‚Äô models, the authors also considered if these models could be inferred from participant responses. The authors also point the reader to Revell & Stanton (Under Review) where a reference table for quick analysis of diagram outputs from the method adopted, contains inferred responses for ‚ÄòTimer‚Äô & ‚ÄòSwitch‚Äô models. Re- sponses were assigned to the following categories: 1) Feedback, 2) Valve, 3) Timer, 4) Switch, 5) Ambiguous and 6) N/A.  2.5.  Case studies  Detailed individual case studies are presented of participants A, B & C. These participants were chosen for this paper, as their mental model descriptions differed signiÔ¨Åcantly from the actual function of the heating system in their home, as well as from the descriptions of each other. The remaining 3 participants from the pool of 6, pro- vided mental model descriptions with conceptual entities and their interrelationships broadly aligned to the actual functioning of the heating system, with a ‚Äòfeedback‚Äô shared theory for the functioning of the thermostat. As the way users signiÔ¨Åcantly misunderstand the functioning of the heating system is of interest in this study, the results from these participants will not be discussed in detail in this paper. Each case study will be presented with a description of the participant and their user veriÔ¨Åed mental model, redrawn for clarity. Discussion within each case study will focus on the consequence of differences in the content (in terms of elements/conceptual entities) and relationship (in terms of conduits between elements and rules of operation) of these mental model descriptions. How these differences inÔ¨Çuence user behaviour, and consequences in terms of energy consumption, will also be discussed.

Participant A: a feedback mental model of elements of valve behaviour  thermostat with  Participant A was a female housewife in her 30‚Äôs. Originally from Malaysia, she lived with her student husband and two school age children. She and her husband both control heating in their home. Participant A‚Äôs user veriÔ¨Åed mental model description of home heating is shown in Fig. 3. This has been redrawn for clarity and the different elements (in rectangles) have been coded according to the key, to distinguish user controls, the device beneÔ¨Åt, and interme- diary elements (between user control and device beneÔ¨Åt). The ar- rows between the elements represent ‚Äòconduits‚Äô of either information or heat distribution. The thick line shows an example causal route between a user control and the device beneÔ¨Åt. Looking at Fig. 3, the elements and conduits form a ‚Äòloop‚Äô shape, which immediately suggests a feedback model to the authors. The control devices include the thermostat knob and the main on/off switch for the heating system. When prompted, participant A was not aware of the existence of either the programmer device, nor the thermostatic radiators valves. Participant A described her goal when using the heating system, was to control the temperature of the whole house. The second aim of this paper was to see if distinct mental models of home heating thermostat‚Äôs could be categorized ac- cording to Kemptons‚Äô (1986) shared theories. To make analysis easier, the elements and conduits which form the causal path for the thermostat, have been redrawn in isolation, in Fig. 4. The left hand element is that which is controlled by the user, depicted with a ‚Äòhand‚Äô. Automation is represented with a ‚Äòrobot head‚Äô, and the rule for automation shown in a thought bubble. Other elements  included in the causal path is shown with a square, and the beneÔ¨Åt of using the home heating system is represented with a star shape. The causal path shown in Fig. 4 was further amended using evidence from the transcripts. The type of function to be performed by each element is indicated with an icon representing either a discrete or variable function, to give the reader a ‚Äòsnapshot‚Äô of the relationship between elements. The relationship between these functions in speciÔ¨Åc scenarios provide insights into cause and effect (De Kleer and brown, 1983). The authors believe that an insight into the likely behaviour patterns of participant A is gained by under- standing how the relationship between these functions allow her to make predictions about the results of her actions. Looking at Fig. 4, we can see that participant A‚Äôs causal rela- tionship includes a thermometer to sense the house temperature and that this feeds back data to the thermostat. The boiler is thought of as functioning like an automatic on/off switch, based on a rule whereby a comparison is made between the temperatures of the set point and house temperature. Referring to Table 2, consid- ering sensing temperature, locus of control and thermostat set point, the data from participant A clearly falls into the typical re- sponses provided by a user holding a feedback model type. When considering the consequence of different set points, Participant A did not explicitly state that the furnace ran at a constant speed, but this is inferred by the authors since she only refers to discrete states of the boiler (on/off/standby) rather than variations in temperature or intensity. The boiler control (which is thought by the authors to be the programmer device) provides feedback on this status by different coloured lights. The quote below emphasises the boiler control is signiÔ¨Åcant to her model of the boiler regulating the house temperature. When reading the transcript below, please note that

VeriÔ¨Åed user mental model description of home heating for participant A.  that participant A initially favoured the term ‚Äòthermometer‚Äô for the entire thermostat unit. Square brackets in the transcriptions show the intended meaning.  ANALYST: All right, so we‚Äôve got this idea when you turn the thermometer [thermostat] up, it [programmer] goes green, nor- mally it‚Äôs on orange, which is our middle one. How does this going green affect what‚Äôs happening in there?  PARTICIPANT A: When the temperature in the house probably down a bit then the temperature that we set, that‚Äôs why it come green.  ANALYST: So you‚Äôre saying you‚Äôve got the temperature that you set, which is from the thermometer [thermostat].  PARTICIPANT A: Yes, set and then maybe the temperature in the house getting colder a bit because of the outside maybe and then . automatically turn to green to make the house warm again to the set temperature.  In terms of patterns of adjustment (Table 2), participant A initially provides clear evidence of a feedback shared theory. She reports adjusting the thermostat to deliberate set points corre- sponding to speciÔ¨Åc times relating to occupancy and activity, as we can see below;  ANALYST: And can you. do you happen to know what tempera- ture you turn it up and down to?  PARTICIPANT A: At the evening, around 6 or 7, I tend to put it up to 23 then we go to sleep we keep it to 21. And, during the day, we normally keep it to 20.  ANALYST: So, at sleep it‚Äôs 21, when you wake up in the morning, do you change it or do you just leave it until your children come home?  PARTICIPANT A: Well, usually I keep it to 20 because I want to keep the house warm because my kids go to school and then I keep it 20 because there is sun outside and if I‚Äôm in the lounge, it gets too hot.  Participant A is also very clear about when the boiler automat-  ically switches off, stating ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs nice and warm to the right tempera- ture, it [the boiler] don‚Äôt do anything.‚Äù and ‚ÄúIt [thermostat] will tell [the boiler] stop working!‚Äù.  The Ô¨Årst quote also considers thermodynamics relating to external temperature, showing again that the device, rather than the user, compensates for changes in external temperature. Ac- cording to Table 2, this is a typical response from a user with a feedback shared theory.  There is an indication, however, that in certain conditions, in certain parts of the house, the device is not able to regulate house temperature sufÔ¨Åciently to maintain comfort, affecting participant A‚Äôs set point choice. This is a response expected from a user with a valve shared theory (see Table 2, external temperature). The ther- mostat used is positioned in the hall (see Fig. 1) in participant A‚Äôs house, and actually takes air temperature readings at its location, inÔ¨Çuenced primarily by the heat output of the hall radiator. The transcript below reveals that participant A imagines the inside

PARTICIPANT A: Usually, the house temperature is. you‚Äôre not touching anything by the small box you‚Äôre talking about. If you just look at that, I think that is temperature of the room. of the house.  ANALYST: Of the house. So when you say the house, do you mean the walls, or.?  PARTICIPANT A: The whole house.  This misinterpretation in her mental model is signiÔ¨Åcant in terms of her self-report of behaviour patterns. Whilst originally describing a regular routine for set point change, when provided with a typical scenario where comfort levels are too high, she revealed ad-hoc adjustments also occurred.  ANALYST: Next one scenario 3: The heating is on, you can feel the radiators are on but you‚Äôve been rushing around doing housework or exercise or looking after the children or cooking and now you feel really hot and uncomfortable, what would you do?  PARTICIPANT A: I would scream my husband put it off!  ANALYST: And when you say put [point to thermostat].  it down, you mean this button  PARTICIPANT A: Yes,  I tell my husband.  ANALYST: O.K. your husband.  PARTICIPANT A: Because I do exercise at home, I work out at home, I do my exercise at home.  ANALYST: How typical  is this and how often would that happen?  PARTICIPANT A: Er, when I go to sleep, actually, every night. Because sometimes he has a habit to make it to 23. I think because he‚Äôs sitting all the time. When I go upstairs to go to sleep, I scream you‚Äôve got it so hot!  Further exploration revealed that this ‚Äòcomfort battle‚Äô between her husband and herself, occurs regularly, during the day. If her husband is home, he frequently increases the thermostat set point  to 22  C, and she returns it to 20  C. This pattern of behaviour is closer to that expected from a user who holds a valve shared theory (see Table 1). Kempton (1986) stated that conÔ¨Çict battles may result in valve behaviour patterns. However, participant A reports that the battle occurs when she and her husband are located in different parts of their home, where thermodynamics of the house structure also effect comfort levels. As Participant A‚Äôs believes the ‚Äòwhole house temperature‚Äô is measured by the thermostat, it is logical, when considering the causal path in her mental model description (Fig. 4), that comfort would be regained by adjusting the set point, rather than a different strategy. More appropriate strategies, such as adjusting the thermostatic radiator valves to different settings to accommodate both her husband (studying downstairs) and herself (exercising, or sleeping upstairs) cannot be considered, as TRV‚Äôs are absent from her mental model description of home heating (Fig. 1). As a result, heat energy is wasted by overheating rooms where a facility to limit the temperature to comfortable levels exists. Participant A clearly provided a mental model description of thermostat function that Ô¨Åt the criteria derived from Kempton (1986) of a ‚Äòfeedback‚Äô shared theory. Self reported planned, regu- lar set point adjustments also Ô¨Åt the behaviour expected from a user holding this theory. Due to comfort conÔ¨Çicts, participant A reported behaviour patterns, which if viewed from set point mea- surements alone, would indicate a valve theory was held. However, the authors argue that this behaviour pattern is driven not just by ‚Äòcomfort conÔ¨Çict‚Äô, but by misinterpretations in the thermostat mental model, as well as an incomplete mental model description for the heating system as a whole.  2.7. Participant B: model  feedback behaviour without a feedback mental  Participant B is a female student in her late 20‚Äôs. Originally from Mexico, she lives with her husband and young child. Participant B‚Äôs mental model description for home heating is shown in Fig. 5 below. She is the sole operator of heating in her home. We can see from Fig. 5 that the mental model description of home heating developed with participant B is more complex and detailed than that for participant A. The shape contains no ‚Äòfeed- back‚Äô loop input to the thermostat device, which suggests the user

VeriÔ¨Åed user mental model of home heating for participant B.  does not hold a feedback shared theory of home heating. Partici- pant B describes multiple control devices, including the program schedule, the override button, the thermostat set point control, boiler control knob and radiator control knobs (TRV‚Äôs) for each radiator. The only heating control absent from this description is the power switch for the whole heating system. Participant B similarly described the purpose of using the heating system, was to warm the whole house. Fig. 6 shows the causal path of the ther- mostat control, isolated from the other control devices, with icons added to represent the function of each element as inferred from the interview transcript. Looking at Fig. 6, we can see that participant B‚Äôs causal rela- tionship for the thermostat set point is dependent on the water supply. There is no thermometer or feedback loop included in the mental model description by participant B. Variations in set point are matched with variations in the volume of water to be heated up by the boiler. In general usage, the boiler operates according to discrete states, automatically switching off when the correspond- ing amount of water has been heated. A larger volume of heated water (following, according to participant B‚Äôs model, from a higher set point value), takes a longer time period to run through the ra- diators, resulting in a greater amount of radiated heat, and ensuring a higher house temperature. When comparing Fig. 6 to the criteria in Table 2, the lack of thermometer refutes a feedback theory being held. However, when responding to questions regarding the boiler override control, it appears participant B is aware there is an inside temperature  display on the thermostat device (see transcript below). She did not consider this of signiÔ¨Åcance, however, when producing her mental model description of home heating (Fig. 5).  ANALYST: what situations do you normally go in and press button to get it to come on?  the  PARTICIPANT B: Basically if I see the temperature is 16 or 17 I feel it‚Äôs a bit cold.  ANALYST: Okay. So even if you perhaps didn‚Äôt feel cold but you noticed it was cold then perhaps turn it on, or is it only if you feel cold?  PARTICIPANT B: Yeah, I feel cold and then I check the temperature and say, ‚ÄúOkay, I‚Äôll turn e  ANALYST: So you making sure you really are cold?  PARTICIPANT B: Yeah, that it‚Äôs not just me. (Laughs)  ANALYST: If thermostat?  you‚Äôre  cold.  So  you  check. and  that‚Äôs  on  the  PARTICIPANT B: Thermostat.  This transcript clearly shows that participant B uses the device to determine if the house temperature is appropriate, rather than her own sense of comfort, which from Table 2 is characteristic of a holder of a feedback, rather than valve, mental model. Considering cause and effect (Fig. 6), there is a clear linear relationship between

We could consider participant B has a ‚Äòvalve‚Äô theory, for the relationship between the thermostat with the water supply, but not with the boiler intensity.  ANALYST: So what would happen then if you had the thermostat, like, up to 30 or something, if you had the thermostat at a really high temperature, the maximum temperature that you can go to, what do you think would happen?  PARTICIPANT B: Well then the boiler will have to produce more hot water and keep going and going through the radiators until they reach the temperature, I mean they make the temperature to 30.  ANALYST: So if 30 is set on the thermostat lots of hot water is made Okay. Allright. What would you think would happen if you turned it right down to 5 ?  PARTICIPANT B: The boiler will not operate  A more appropriate analogy may be that each set point temper- ature has a Ô¨Åxed volume of water associated with it. When adjusting the set point, a message is sent to the boiler to select and heat up the corresponding volume of water. This also is clearly different from a feedback theory, whereby the boiler operates until the house ach- ieves set point temperature, sensed by a thermometer. However, it may lead to similar behaviour, as it is accepted by participant B, that the system ensures, through this selection of water volume, that the desired house temperature will have been reached when the boiler deactivates. Continuous adjustments of thermostat set point would therefore be unnecessary. The consequence of different set points, when considering the relationship with water volume again can be interpreted as belonging to ‚Äòvalve theory‚Äô, as larger amounts of heated water result from larger increases in set point. The transcript above, however, could also be interpreted as ‚Äòfeedback theory‚Äô according to Table 2, despite following from a mental model description that lacks a feedback loop. Heating larger volumes of water, assuming the boiler runs at a constant speed, also predicts the furnace will run for longer periods. When questioned, participant B was clear that the water temperature in the boiler was  not raised by the thermostat, so a valve theory for boiler operation, as described by Kempton (1986) is refuted. When questioned about her behaviour patterns when operating the thermsostat, participant B reported keeping the set point at a single value, relying on the programmer to regulate the heat. This behaviour again Ô¨Åts better with a response expected from a holder of a feedback, rather than valve, model (Table 2).  ANALYST: Okay, so you‚Äôre saying the thermostat‚Äôs normally set at 20, sometimes you notice it‚Äôs cold, would you then when you notice it‚Äôs cold turn the thermostat up or just go to the programmer and press the programme?  PARTICIPANT B: Go to the programmer.  ANALYST: Okay. is there any reason you would go and change through your thermostat?  PARTICIPANT B: No.  ANALYST: No? Okay. So not during the week or weekends or holi- days or anything like that, you would just keep it how it is and make everything controlled through the programmer?  PARTICIPANT B: Yeah.  A goal of this paper was to see if distinct behaviour patterns of thermostat function could be categorized according to Kempton‚Äôs (1986) shared theories. This has been difÔ¨Åcult to achieve with participant B‚Äôs mental model description. Many traits which would be expected from a user holding a feedback theory were discovered. However, the concept of feedback, or temperature sensing was not present her veriÔ¨Åed mental model description (Fig. 5). The linear relationship between the thermostat set point and the water sup- ply, was more akin to a valve theory, however it should be noted that this is not with the sense intended by Kempton (1986), which relates to heat Ô¨Çow or intensity in the boiler. Kempton (1986) suggested that users with a feedback shared theory could unnec- essarily waste energy by avoiding ‚Äònight set back‚Äô of the thermostat. Participant B uses the programmer to limit consumption at night, so the need for night set-back is negated regardless of the theory held. The reasoning of feedback theory holders, according to  
K.M.A . Revell, N.A . Stanton / Applied Ergonomics 45 (2014) 363e378  373  Kempton (1986) (and summarised in Table 1) is that it will take more energy to re-heat a cold house, than to maintain a warm house. This thinking is evident with Participant B in the following quote. From participant B‚Äôs transcript, neither the thermostat or programmer settings are adjusted when away from the house at the weekend, or on holidays, suggesting energy is wasted by heating an unoccupied house.  PARTICIPANT B: Well I was actually thinking with that setting that I need. or that the house needs to be heated for not such a short time because maybe it will have to work more the next day. I mean to not leave the house unheated for a long period of time.  The desire to identify distinct mental models of device function, is to be able to predict user behaviour. Participant B, whilst using a deliberate thermostat set point, does not habitually make adjust- ments (preferring to use the programmer and override device). Fig. 5 shows uncertainty in much of the mental model description relating to the thermostat device, with underlined areas show low conÔ¨Ådence in the description. Participant B‚Äôs mental model for thermostat function may be poorly developed, because she does not use the thermostat. On the other hand, participant B may not use the thermostat because her mental model of the thermostat is ambiguous or incomplete, undermining conÔ¨Ådence in the outcome of her actions. The ability to predict behaviour patterns relating to user mental models of device function is necessary if design stra- tegies to improve usability or inÔ¨Çuence behaviour are to be suc- cessful. This association is clearly more likely to be found when the participant actively uses the device under investigation.  2.8.  Participant C: timer model  for alternate control devices  Participant C was a female student in her 20‚Äôs. Originally from Brunei, she lived with her husband, young child and father-in-law, and is the sole operator of the heating system. Fig. 7 shows her user veriÔ¨Åed mental model description of home heating. Participant C‚Äôs mental model description of home heating, is linear and branched in shape, and shows 3 different user controls; the schedule for the timer, the on/off (or override) switch for the programmer and the radiator knob (Thermostatic Radiator Valve (TRV)). The device beneÔ¨Åt is not considered the house temperature, as with participants A and B, but rather her own thermal comfort. Conspicuous by its absence is the thermostat device. The second aim of this paper was to determine if mental model descriptions of thermostat function can be categorized according to the shared theory types in the literature. It is clear from the lack of thermostat device in Fig. 7, that this type of analysis couldn‚Äôt be undertaken. To further the initial aim, that distinct mental model descriptions of home heating exist, two causal paths will be described from participant C of alternate control devices, as they provide further insights into the consequence of incomplete mental models. The causal path of the program schedule, and of the boiler override button are shown in Figs. 8 and 9. Unlike the previous causal paths, which focused on the thermostat, these include icons representing a time based variable. Participant C clearly describes the programmer unit as a time based automatic switch, responsible for turning the radiators on and off;  Fig. 7. User veriÔ¨Åed Mental Model description of home heating function,  from participant C.

Cause and effect route of schedule function for participant C.  ‚ÄúIt is a digital device for the system to say at what time you want it to come on, and it will light up to yellow colour if the radiator is on and it will light up to red if the radiator is off, and it is automatically turned to on and off by the program‚Äù  Fig. 8 displays a linear route from manual input of the schedule to the resulting increase in body temperature, with the schedule function being time-based. The timer button (program option on the programmer), boiler and radiators are reported in the transcripts as being either be ‚Äòon‚Äô or ‚Äòoff‚Äô so function according to discrete, rather than variable states. This is an appropriate mental model for the programmer, if used in isolation. It is not clear from the transcript if the beneÔ¨Åt, in terms of body temperature, is directly linked to the schedule, so an icon is absent from this element in Fig. 6. Fig. 9 shows the cause and effect route for the override button for the programmer, which participant C referred to as the ‚Äòon/off‚Äô switch. This button allows the boiler to be activated outside of scheduled times. Participant C reported that when using the override switch, the boiler switched itself off after approximately 15 min. The following transcript describe her confusion about this outcome. The blank lines represent parts of the conversation that have been omitted as they do not add new insights.  ANALYST: How do you think it knows when to come off? . is it from the timer? Or something else that makes it switch off?  PARTICIPANT C: It can‚Äôt be the timer because the timer is already being programmed so it must be something else. It‚Äôs by default it will just go off.  ANALYST: So maybe after a certain period of time, or?  PARTICIPANT C: Yeah.  ANALYST: Okay. So you‚Äôve kind of got this idea about whenever you switch it on, it‚Äôs almost like it‚Äôs only on for a short period.  PARTICIPANT C: Yes it doesn‚Äôt obey me.  From the last comment, it is clear that participant C does not feel in control of the effects of this device. Further discussion led to the idea of a ‚Äòclock‚Äô telling the program when to switch off. The un- certain language used in the transcript above (‚Äúit must be‚Äù, ‚Äúit can‚Äôt be‚Äù) mean it is likely that this link was a construct of the interview, rather than the participants‚Äô existing mental model of the user (Payne, 1991). The authors argue that the need to add to a mental model to explain an unexpected phenomenon shows that the existing model of the system is not fully functional for this partic- ipant. Moray (1990) emphasised how it was not possible to trou- bleshooting problems successfully if the mental model held by a user, lacked the elements responsible for the problem source. It is likely that the true cause of the boiler deactivating a short period after the participant presses the override button, is the thermom- eter registering its surrounding air temperature equal to the  Fig. 9. Cause and effect depiction of override button for participant C.  
K.M.A . Revell, N.A . Stanton / Applied Ergonomics 45 (2014) 363e378  375  thermostat set point (presumably set to a value below participant C‚Äôs comfort levels). Since a thermostat device and thermometer are both absent from this participants mental model description (Fig. 7), this conclusion could not be arrived at by participant C herself. Participant C relies on a daily schedule, which she believes en- sures the boiler operates to produce heat for a short period in the morning, an hour for lunch, and a longer period in the evening. The schedule is repeated 7 days a week, regardless of changes in ac- tivity. When asked when she used the override button, participant C revealed that she regularly overrides the system when the heating is scheduled to be on (between 5pm and 10pm). Participant C does not appear to see a conÔ¨Çict with her mental model of the timer, which is turning the boiler ‚Äòon and off‚Äô according to the schedule, and the need to override the program during scheduled ‚Äòon‚Äô times. She also admits to using an electric portable heater or ‚Äúblower‚Äù to maintain or increase comfort levels between, or during scheduled times. These additional actions suggest that the home heating system with the existing schedule and (unknown) set point, fails to meet the comfort needs of participant C. Depending on how energy hungry the model of portable heater, and the fre- quency and durations of operation, this strategy may result in higher levels of consumption than if the central heating had been set up to provide adequate comfort levels. However, it is possible, that this proximal ad-hoc heating from an alternate heat source is more energy efÔ¨Åcient at meeting comfort needs, than if the whole house was heated for longer periods. When provided with scenarios where her comfort levels are too low, participant C provided a range of strategies unrelated to her mental model description of home heating (Fig. 7). These included washing hands, showering, putting on the portable heater, moving away from the window, putting on a blanket, and even lighting candles. The authors infer from this response that Participant C considers the central heating system in her home to be one of a range of solutions for achieving comfort, rather than the key so- lution. As her goal for using the heating is body temperature, rather than house temperature, it may be more appropriate to gain this participants mental model of comfort, rather than device function. Whilst the lack of thermostat in participant C‚Äôs mental model description meant is was inappropriate to evaluate if Kempton‚Äôs (1986) shared theories were present, the authors examined the transcript for evidence relating to generic ‚Äòvalve‚Äô or ‚Äòfeedback‚Äô concepts. When participant C was asked how she knew the heating was on, she reported that ‚ÄúI will. Ô¨Årst thing I will think house is warm , suggesting that she is sensing comfort, rather than referring to a device to get feedback of boiler activation. When describing how she though thermostatic radiator valves work, she similarly described valve thinking ‚ÄúThe amount of the Ô¨Çow of the heating material Ô¨Çowing through the radiator. So if this is being turned on then there‚Äôll be more Ô¨Çowing into the radiator‚Äù. There is no sense of variations in temperature or intensity of heat as a result of the heating system, however. Feedback concepts were completely ab- sent from the transcript. For this participant, further exploration of timer mental models of home heating would be appropriate.  3. Discussion  A small scale intergroup case study was undertaken to identify: 1) If distinct mental models of the way home heating systems function could be found, that differ signiÔ¨Åcantly from the actual functioning of UK systems, and 2) If these models could be cate- gorized according to ‚Äòshared theories‚Äô of thermostat function from the literature. Data was collected from 6 participants in matched environments using a semi-structured interview including paper- based activities, developed by the authors (see Revell and  Stanton, 2012, and Revell & Stanton, Under Review, for further details). The impetus for the research was to understand if the mental models held by individuals could explain their energy consuming behaviour in a way that could usefully inform strategies aimed at reducing consumption through behaviour change. The authors found that 3 of the 6 participants produced mental model descriptions of their home heating system that differed signiÔ¨Åcantly from the actual functioning of their system. The dif- ferences explained their self-reported behaviour with their home heating system, which, by association, may also explain their levels of energy consumption. From the mental model descriptions pro- duced by the 6 participants, 4 represented thermostat function in a way that could be categorized according to Kempton‚Äôs (1986) ‚Äòfeedback‚Äô shared theory (a simpliÔ¨Åed version of the actual home heating functioning). One participant described a variation of Kempton‚Äôs (1986) ‚Äòvalve‚Äô theory, and another participant omitted the thermostat device from her description, preventing comparable categorization. Timer and Switch shared theories for the thermo- stat, were found useful for categorizing user mental models of alternate home heating controls, such as the programmer and boiler override button. The valve shared theory could also be applied in a general sense to user mental models of the TRVs. The key Ô¨Åndings of this study, that add to the existing body of knowledge, are 1) that UMMs of thermostat function can be found that fall outside of the Feedback, Valve, Timer & Switch shared theories described by Kempton (1986), Norman (2002) and Peffer et al. (2011), and 2) omissions of entire control devices from UMMs of home heating, were evident despite an environment matched in terms of dwelling, and type and layout of home heating devices. In addition, (though not emphasised in the reporting of the three in depth case studies), thermostat set point adjustment was less prevalent than expected, with 4 out of the 6 participants reporting a reliance on other devices (e.g. programmer, override button and TRVs) when adjusting their home heating output. Finaly, the discrepency of the user‚Äôs goal when using the heating system (e.g. heating the whole house or increasing the comfort of the occupant) and the actual beneÔ¨Åt of the system (i.e. to produce a constant rate and intensity of heat, limited in period of operation by the program schedule, in activation by the thermostat set point, and in output by the TRVs set point) was also helpful when explaining reported confusion by the user, when operating the system. In itself, the existence of UMMs that cannot be easily categorized according to existing shared theories is only important in terms of energy consumption, if the associated behaviour is signiÔ¨Åcantly more or less ‚Äòwasteful‚Äô. In this study, the associated (self reported) behaviour of participant B closely matched that expected of users holding a ‚Äòfeedback‚Äô theory, so participant B‚Äôs speciÔ¨Åc UMM is not of special interest. However, consensus in the literature (e.g. Kempton, 1986; Norman, 2002; Peffer et al., 2011; Richardson and Ball, 2009) that UMMs fall into these categories of shared theory is challenged. This suggests that the existence of additional ‚Äòshared theories‚Äô or unique individual UMMs, that may have a signiÔ¨Åcant impact in terms of energy consuming behaviour, cannot be ruled out. The omission of control devices, rather than merely settings/ options on a device, is an important Ô¨Ånding. The omitted devices in our study included key controls, such as the programmer and thermostat, that hold a signiÔ¨Åcant role in allowing the user to optimise energy consumption. The lack of key controls in UMMs affects the strategies that users can adopt in order to meet their goals. For example, it could impede users from achieving their desired level of comfort by being unaware they could adjust the thermostat or TRV setting, or that they could set the programmer to start heating before getting up). Alternatively, it could prevent users from reducing consumption by being unaware they could  
376  K.M.A . Revell, N.A . Stanton / Applied Ergonomics 45 (2014) 363e378  reduce the thermostat or TRV setting, or that they could set the programmer to automatically switch off at times when the home is typically unoccupied. A failure to meet user goals, as in the case of participant C, who reverted to an electric heater when failing to meeting her comfort goals, could encourage alternate strategies that may be more costly in terms of energy consumption that optimal operation of the home heating system. In addition, the lack of key controls in UMMs of their own heating system, could hinder the success of advice based strategies to encourage reduced con- sumption in the home, when based on changes to the way users operate ‚Äòomitted‚Äô devices. For example, government advice in the UK to ‚Äòturn down your thermostat by 1 ‚Äô (www.energysavingtrust. org.uk) would have little effect on participant C in this study, who omitted the thermostat control when producing her mental model description of home heating. Whilst the number in this intergroup case study are too small to indicate a trend, the preference of the majority of participants in this study to favour the programmer and boiler override devices to the thermostat, when asked about ad-hoc or routine adjustments, was surprising to the authors given an emphasis in the literature on thermostat behaviour styles (e.g. Kempton, 1986; Norman, 2002; Richardson and Ball, 2009; Peffer et al., 2011). If large proportions of the general UK population also seek out alternate control devices to the thermostat, when making adjustments, it calls into question the present day relevance of Kempton‚Äôs (1986) insight. It may no longer be important to consider user‚Äôs ‚Äòshared theories‚Äô of ther- mostat function and associated behaviour patterns, as a means of understanding domestic energy consumption. However, this intergroup case study does suggest that a link between UMMs of home heating and their strategies for controlling heating are associated, so applying Kempton‚Äôs (1986) insight at the system level, incorporating the integration of a range of control devices, rather than to a single control device, may be more appropriate. When a user needs to translate their home heating goals (e.g. comfort, reduced consumption) in terms of the options available on the home heating system (e.g. home heating control set points, options & schedule durations), the ease of this translation is likely to effect optimal operation. This link between goals, mental models, strategies and performance is clear in the literature for interaction with devices (Norman, 1986) and within complex systems (Bainbridge, 1992; Moray, 1990) In this case study, not only was there evidence of users not being able to meet their goals with Participants A & C, but also a misunderstanding of the beneÔ¨Åt, that the home heating system could provide (e.g. Participants A & B, who thought the thermostat setting ensured the whole house was maintained at the chosen temperature). The authors believe that a better under- standing of how to encourage optimal behaviour with home heating systems would beneÔ¨Åt from considering not only how well the heating system can accommodate user goals, but also how appro- priate users expectations were, of the heating system‚Äôs beneÔ¨Åt. The data collection approach was chosen to achieve key objec- tives for this inter-group case study: 1) To encourage accuracy in the capture of UMMs by considering bias in interpretation in its development. 2) To capture a description of the user‚Äôs device model. 3) to represent the users device model description in a concrete diagram form, to aid design based strategies. 4) to produce data that allows categorization of UMMs of thermostat function by existing shared theories in the literature, 5) To produce data that allowed alternate theories to be considered. The method developed was intended to enhance previous methods of data collection from established researchers such as Kempton (1986) and Payne (1991) through mitigation of bias and reduction of ambiguity in the outputs. However, a systematic method of considering bias was used in the development of the method, with mitigating strategies or acknowledgement of bias stated in Table 1.  This provides readers with transparency so they can appreciate the steps undertaken to increase the chances that the captured mental model descriptions reÔ¨Çects the user, rather than the analyst. The paper-based element of the method was well suited in structure to capture users‚Äô device models of home heating. This concrete repre- sentation clearly identiÔ¨Åed missing elements and mis- understandings, providing emphasis for targetted strategies aimed at enhancing UMMs to encourage energy consuming behaviour. In terms of capturing and depicting the users device model, the authors consider the process to develop and the resulting form of the user veriÔ¨Åed mental model description meets the objectives. Considering the methods ability to categorize UMMs according to shared theories in the literature, Table 2 was helpful in categorizing according to Kempton‚Äôs (1986; 1987) feedback & valve shared theories, but switch/timer shared theories needed to be inferred as Norman (2002) & Peffer et al. (2011) gave insufÔ¨Åcient information to populate the categories derived through content analysis of Kemptons‚Äôs descriptions. However, the authors are conÔ¨Ådent that they did not overlook any evidence that the users held timer and switch theories for thermostat function in the intergroup case study. The concepts of timer/switch theories and Kempton‚Äôs valve theory are clearly applicable to other home heating control devices in the study, both appropriately and inappropriately applied. A more generic (e.g. control device independent) deÔ¨Ånition of these theories would aid applicability to a range of energy consuming devices and could therefore have broader reach in understanding non-optimal user behaviour. The semi-structured style of the interview was beneÔ¨Åcial in allowing participants to freely express ideas that were outside the scope of the shared theories from the literature. This was seen with participant B‚Äôs variation on Kempton‚Äôs (1986) Valve theory for the thermostat. When researching mental models, as with any internal construct, there are limitation as it is not possible to directly assess and characterise the concept (Zhang et al., 2010). The method for extracting information and describing the user mental model will always be subject to bias based on the decisions, perspective and requirements of the analyst (Zhang et al., 2010; Wilson and Rutherford, 1989; Bainbridge, 1992; Revell and Stanton, 2012). Revell and Stanton (2012) argue that by systematically evaluating and stating the bias in data collection and analysis, the risk to bias for the resulting mental model description is explicit. This partic- ular method necessarily accessed mental model subsequent to device use, due to the nature of the domain. As such there is risk of models being spontaneously created as part of the process (Payne, 1991), although the language used and hesitancy of answer does provide an indication of this. The interview process itself gives an opportunity for the user to reÔ¨Çect upon and reÔ¨Åne their mental model which is unavoidable. Nevertheless, reÔ¨Ånements of a mental model that lacks key elements, or contains a misunderstood rela- tionship between components through this process does not pro- vide additional information that would allow misunderstandings to be corrected. The fundamental misunderstandings or emissions, rather than reÔ¨Ånements on these understandings are most illumi- nating in terms determining strategies to encourage energy saving behaviour. There are clear challenges when trying to validate any internal construct, as direct access is not possible. Never-the-less, where there are clear absences of key components of the home heating system, in the mental model description, or unexpected interpretations of cause and effect, it is unlikely through the choice of probes and construction of diagrams, that the participant con- structed an alternate view whilst actually holding a more accurate mental model of the heating system. Another limitation of this research is the general applicability to a typical UK population due to the characteristics of the user group and the small sample size. This group‚Äôs limited exposure to home  
K.M.A . Revell, N.A . Stanton / Applied Ergonomics 45 (2014) 363e378  377  heating was, however a beneÔ¨Åt in being able to attribute the UMM descriptions to experiences with the devices present in the matched accommodation, rather than the extensive experience a typical UK resident would have. As the user group was in matched accommodation, it also means the device layout and model types can be considered a starting point from which to consider design based strategies to encourage behaviour change that take into ac- count the misunderstandings and omissions seen. Further work needs to be done with a larger sample size and more typical UK population to determine if the speciÔ¨Åc mis- understandings and omissions (in terms of the elements and re- lationships of components present in users device models of home heating systems) that were found in this intergroup case study are more generally applicable. A larger sample would also better indicate the current prevalence of existing shared theories from the literature, applied either to the thermostat, or more generically to alternate control devices. It may also reveal new shared theories to add to those already present in the literature. To understand if the device model or shared theory held, translates to signiÔ¨Åcant dif- ferences in users energy consuming behaviour additional work needs to be done. A study that collects actual user behaviour with the typical range of home heating control devices, in addition to users device models of the home heating system could shed light on this relationship. There is presently much interest in to how to improve consumption with heating systems through design, focusing on programmable thermostats (e.g. Combe et al., 2011; Peffer et al., 2013), as well as investigation into the beneÔ¨Åt of support aids for central heating (e.g. Sauer et al., 2009). The authors believe that the central heating system needs to be considered as just that, a system. Sauer et al., 2009, considers home heating to be the most complex system in the domestic domain. Consideration of individual control devices, in terms of usability is clearly important, but users need to be aware of which control devices to use in which situations, to fulÔ¨Ål their comfort and consumption goals. Support aids for central heating, or the redesign of central heating devices, that promoted a functional mental model to users of the integration between components of the heating system, could provide beneÔ¨Åts beyond enhanced feedback or proscriptive guidance. The authors propose providing users with a pragmatic understanding of cause and effect for the multiple control devices presented on their heating system, that allows them to: a) relate their actions to their individual goals, and, just as importantly, b) understand when their individual goals cannot be met by the system. This could not only reduce consumption, but enhance comfort, providing the ‚Äòoptimal consumption‚Äô we all seek.  4.  Conclusion  Through comparison of user veriÔ¨Åed mental model descriptions of home heating, distinct mental models that differ signiÔ¨Åcantly from the actual functioning of UK heating systems were shown. Evidence of Kempton‚Äôs (1986) feedback shared theory for the functioning of the thermostat was found. Other shared theories from the literature were useful in categorizing alternate control devices. A user mental model of the thermostat that could not be assigned to the existing shared theories in the literature was also found. Differences in the control devices present in mental model descriptions could explain confusion in operation. Differences in the causal path for speciÔ¨Åc control devices explained differences in reported behaviour. Variables such as the type and number of controllers and assumed device beneÔ¨Åt appeared to interact with mental models of device function to explain reported behaviour. To apply the notion of mental models of home heating to encourage optimal energy consumption misunderstandings and omissions in user mental models could target design focus to encourage users  to hold more integrated, functional models. Further work is needed to prove association between shared theories categorized by this method, and actual behaviour with devices, as well as methods for applying mental model descriptions in design strategies.

s0003687013001130,"  The ongoing need to reduce human error leads to more and more frequent use of simulators in both experimental studies and training (e.g., Edquist et al., 2011; Yang et al., 2013). An important advantage of the use of simulators in experimental studies is the ability to control many environmental factors, as well as the pos- sibility of recording a number of variables relating to the cardio- vascular system, electrodermal response or oculomotor response e to name just a few (e.g., Brookhuis and de Waard, 2010, 2011;  E-mail  addresses:  * Corresponding author.

Haarmann et al., 2009; Underwood et al., 2011; Zuzewicz et al., 2011). An analysis of these variables can be helpful in assessing the impact of speciÔ¨Åc tasks on the occurrence of fatigue or work- load (Davenne et al., 2012; Sung et al., 2005). The data collected from these studies allow, on the one hand, an optimal working environment to be constructed from the point of view of a man as an operator, and on the other, an assessment of the inÔ¨Çuence of certain occupational conditions or used substances on the func- tioning of humans (Siedlecka and Bortkiewicz, 2012; Stoner et al., 2011; Stough et al., 2012). Simulators are also increasingly used in the treatment of patients with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and fear of Ô¨Çying, as well as for training (Classen et al., 2011; Devlin et al., 2012; Kraft et al., 2010). A wide range of applications for simulators, together with their increased use in scientiÔ¨Åc research and training, has highlighted the problem of simulator sickness (SS) (Brooks et al., 2010; Biernacki and Dziuda, 2012; Kennedy et al., 2010).  0003-6870/$ e see front matter √ì 2013 Elsevier Ltd and The Ergonomics Society.

The occurrence of simulator sick- ness can also provide an additional source of stress. This is partic- ularly important in the case of the use of simulators in the treatment of PTSD or in the treatment of fear of Ô¨Çying (Beck et al., 2007; Classen et al., 2011; Devlin et al., 2012; Kraft et al., 2010). Research on simulation sickness includes an even wider number of factors relating to individual characteristics (e.g. gender, age, experience), the time of the study and test conditions, to name just a few. A detailed review of the studies devoted to this subject can be found in the articles by Classen et al. (2011), Kennedy et al. (2010) and Stoner et al. (2011). However, from the perspective of our research, we were particularly interested in two issues: the impact of test conditions on the intensiÔ¨Åcation of simulator sickness symptoms and the after-effects of simulation sickness. One important aspect of tests involving simulators is how different simulator test conditions affect the severity of simulator sickness symptoms. Among the simulator test conditions, we should specify those related to the mobility of the platform as well as those related to the type of visual stimuli (e.g. Drexler, 2006; So et al., 2001). For example, Sharples et al. (2008) conducted a study in which she decided to check whether the severity of simulator sickness symptoms is different in the case of four virtual reality display conditions. The conditions that were used in the study included head-mounted display (HMD), desktop, projection screen and reality theatre. This study also involved user control (active vs. passive viewing) and lighting conditions (light vs. dark conditions). To assess simulator sickness symptoms, the Simulator Sickness Questionnaire (SSQ) was used, which allows the relevant assess- ment on the level of total severity and three subscales that represent separable dimensions of simulator sickness: nausea, visuomotor disturbances and disorientation (Kennedy et al., 1993). The obtained results showed that in 60e70% of cases, exposure to HMD was associated with an increase in simulator sickness symptoms. In the case of comparisons between HMD and desktop, a signiÔ¨Åcant change in nausea symptoms was observed, while in the comparison of HMD and reality theatre an increase in regard to nausea, oculo- motor disturbances and disorientation was noted. An intensiÔ¨Åcation of simulator sickness symptoms was also recorded, particularly with regard to oculomotor disturbances and Total SSQ symptoms, in persons who were passive viewing compared to the participants who had control over their movements in the virtual environment (VE) (Sharples et al., 2008). The severity of simulator sickness symptoms also varies depending on the kind of traditional simulator used. The research by Drexler (2006), who compared a Ô¨Åxed-wing, rotary-wing and driving simulator, indicates that the greatest severity of symptoms related to disorientation, compared to Ô¨Åxed- wing and rotary-wing simulators, is observed in the case of using a driving simulator. The highest level of oculomotor disturbances was noted for the Ô¨Åxed-wing, then the rotary-wing, and Ô¨Ånally for the driving simulator. On the other hand, the level of nausea remained at a similar level in all test conditions applied. In the case of using a driving simulator, the most severe symptoms were observed in oculomotor disturbances, then disorientation, and the least severe symptoms were recorded for nausea (D > O > N SSQ proÔ¨Åle). Apart from the kind of applied visual stimuli, another factor taken into account in research on simulator sickness is the type of platform used (Ô¨Åxed base vs. motion base platform). In the case of experiments using Ô¨Åxed base platforms, information concerning the motion is provided to the tested person via visual information. Motion base platforms are used to increase the Ô¨Ådelity or realism of the simulation. In the case of motion base platforms, information  concerning the motion provided via changes in visual display are supplemented with the changes in the position of the platform (motion base platforms enhance the sense of self-motion provided by the visual display (Stoner et al., 2011). Thus, motion base plat- forms used in simulators can provide two types of inertial cues: acceleration and tilt (Kennedy et al., 1987; Stoner et al., 2011). Curry et al. (2002) decided to assess the differences in the severity of simulator sickness between a Ô¨Åxed base and a motion base with a 6 degrees of freedom (6 DOF) driving simulator. The analysis of results showed that the severity of simulator sickness symptoms was higher when using a Ô¨Åxed base simulator compared to the motion base one. However, in both cases, the proÔ¨Åle of individual SSQ subscales was the same (D > O > N). On the other hand, some studies indicate that when the perceived motion is only based on visual stimuli, as it is in the case of Ô¨Åxed base platforms, a particular increase is observed for the nausea symptoms (e.g. McCauley and Sharkey, 1992; May and Badcock, 2002). Stoner et al. (2011) also point to the fact that the use of motion base platforms may not result in a difference between the severity of simulator sickness compared to Ô¨Åxed base platforms, and may even increase the severity of its symptoms. Therefore, it seems that the research on the inÔ¨Çuence of the type of the simulated motion (Ô¨Åxed base vs. motion base platforms) on simulator sickness symptoms needs to be undertaken in the future. Another question highlighted in the studies on simulator sick- ness refers to how long the effects of exposure to simulated con- ditions persist over time and how quickly the symptoms of simulator sickness appear. For example, Min et al. (2004) assessed the level of simulator sickness, estimated by SSQ and psychophysi- ological indicators, in 5-minute intervals in the course of performing a 60-minute task in a driving simulator. The analysis of the results showed that subjectively experienced simulator sickness symptoms already appeared 10 min after the main experiment started in the case of nausea, disorientation and Total SSQ, and after 15 min in the case of oculomotor disturbances. Moreover, the severity of the symptoms increased linearly with each next measurement. This result conÔ¨Årms that simulator sickness is a result of the time spent in a simulator (e.g. Kennedy et al., 2000; Kennedy and Fowlkes, 1992 Lampton et al., 1994; Stanney et al., 1998). In addition to this, the changes in psychophysiological variables, for both the autonomic and the central nervous system, already showed a signiÔ¨Åcant change after 5 mins from the start of the study. This means that the sub- jective psychological evaluation is delayed compared to the response of the physiological indicators. Demonstrating that the physiological parameters react faster to the simulator test condi- tions compared to the subjective evaluation can help identify early signs of simulator sickness, before it is noticeable under the sub- jective evaluation of the tested person. The fact that the duration of the experiment on the simulator is accompanied by the intensiÔ¨Å- cation of simulator sickness symptoms and the changes in the level of physiological variables raises the question how long simulator sickness symptoms persist (after-effects) after the cessation of per- forming the task on the simulator. This issue was investigated, inter alia, in the study conducted by Muth (2009), which assessed the level of cognitive functions (Cognitive Test Battery), the individual‚Äôs balance (Sharpened Romberg) and the integrity of the visual- vestibular interaction (Dynamic Visual Acuity Test) before the test, immediately after it, and 2, 4, 6, 8 and 24 h after the simulator test. The analysis of the results showed that ‚Äúuncoupled motion sce- nario‚Äù resulted in a deterioration in cognitive functioning. This deterioration was particularly evident 2e4 h after the exposure to the simulated conditions. The changes in physiological parameters were noted 1e2 h after the end of the experiment. Muth points out, however, that the resulting after-effects in cognitive functions should be not be associated with the experienced symptoms of simulator sickness. Baltzley et al. (1989), in a study on a group  
408  ≈Åukasz Dziuda et al.  / Applied Ergonomics 45 (2014) 406e412  consisting of 700 subjects, showed that simulator sickness symp- toms were experienced by 45% of the people examined. In addition, 25% of simulator sickness symptoms persisted for a period exceeding 1 h and 8% of such symptoms persisted for over 6 h after the end of the simulator test. Thus, simulator sickness is a phenomenon that needs to be controlled as much as possible. Otherwise, it may impact on the effect of experimental manipulation, the effect of training or the therapeutic effect. The aim of our study was to answer the following questions:  1) Do different simulator test conditions affect simulator sickness symptoms?  the severity of  Within this question, we were mainly interested in:  - whether the application of the conditions in which the visual stimuli reception is disturbed (fog condition) will change the severity of simulator sickness. This question is particularly important because we do not know of any studies related to this visual condition. - whether the use of the motion base platform will change the severity of simulator sickness. This question is particularly important as the issue of how the use of motion base platforms reduces or increases the severity of simulator sickness symp- toms remains valid. 2) How does the severity of simulator sickness symptoms change over time?  Within this question we were mainly interested in how long the simulator sickness symptoms persist. This question is signiÔ¨Åcant since few research attempts refer to the presence of symptoms a day after the simulator test.  3)  Is there any interaction between the simulator test conditions and the moment of measurement?  In formulating this question we were particularly interested in whether the simulator testing conditions affect the severity of simulator sickness symptoms in different ways, depending on the time which has elapsed since performing the task in the simulator? In other words, we were interested in whether the symptoms of simulator sickness persist for different periods of time after the end of the simulation test, depending on the simulator test conditions.  2. Material and methods  Twelve men aged 24e33 years (M ¬º 28.8, SD ¬º 3.26) partici- pated in the study. All the tested subjects were professional drivers who had possessed a driving licence authorizing them to drive trucks (driving licence category C) for a minimum of 5 years. The average number of kilometres travelled by the drivers in the study group was about 400,000 km. All subjects had a valid medical ex- amination certiÔ¨Åcate entitling them to drive. The subjects had no prior experience of performing any tasks in simulators. The study used a truck simulator manufactured by ETC-PZL Aerospace Industries. The simulator was built based on a fully equipped, air-conditioned cabin of a modern Mercedes-Benz Actros truck. The cabin was mounted on a motion base platform with 6 DOF, which allowed the position of the simulator cabin to be changed along and around the longitudinal, transverse and vertical axes. The parameters characterizing the movement of the motion base platform are presented in Table 1.  The projection of the simulated road environment images took place on the cylinder screen with a radius of 4.10 m, and a 180 horizontal and 40 vertical Ô¨Åeld of view. The frequency for gener- ating the image was 60 Hz and the frequency for projecting the image also equalled 60 Hz. The image was displayed at a distance of 4.03 m in a straight line from the optic point. The simulator allowed the realization of the selected route with automatic transmission, and a camera system installed in the cabin facilitated the ongoing observation of both the road environment and the driver‚Äôs behav- iour while driving. The simulator test conditions met the standards for this type of study (Stoner et al., 2011). To assess the severity of the simulator sickness symptoms, the SSQ questionnaire was used, which is currently the most widely applied measure for the subjective assessment of simulator sick- ness symptoms (Kennedy et al., 1993). SSQ contains 16 diagnostic items rated by the participants as ‚Äúnone‚Äù, ‚Äúslight‚Äù, ‚Äúmoderate‚Äù or ‚Äúsevere‚Äù. These items form three subscales: nausea (N), oculomotor disturbances (O) and disorientation (D), and the total SSQ score (T) (Kennedy et al., 1993). Each of the subjects performed three 30-minute simulator driving tasks running along the same route. Each of these tasks was carried out in a different simulator conÔ¨Åguration:   set of conditions A e Ô¨Åxed base platform and poor visibility (fog)  set of conditions B e Ô¨Åxed base platform and good visibility  set of conditions C e motion base platform and good visibility.  Sets of conditions B and C did not differ in terms of visibility and varied in the use of a motion or Ô¨Åxed base platform. Fig. 1 shows an example of poor visibility conditions (A), while Fig. 2 shows an example of good visibility (B and C). On a scale from 0 to 100, mist was set on 30, with 0 being very good visibility and 100 indicating very poor visibility. The measurement of the severity of the simulator sickness symptoms took place at the following intervals: before exposure to the simulator; 2 min after exposure to the simulator; 0.5 h after exposure to the simulator; in the evening of the same day; in the morning of the next day. The order of exposure to the various test conditions was random. This minimized the impact of the order of measurement and repeated measures on the level of experienced simulator sickness symptoms (e.g. Kennedy et al., 2000). This is particularly important in the context of the study conducted by Kennedy et al. (2000) which showed that an increase in the hours spent in the simulator (successive Ô¨Çights) is accompanied by a decrease in the level of experienced simulator sickness symptoms.  3.  Statistical analysis  N, O, D and T variations during the experiment were all analysed by means of two-way ANOVA with repeated measures, the  Table 1 Mean values and standard deviations of the parameters characterizing the dynamics of the motion base platform.

≈Åukasz Dziuda et al.  / Applied Ergonomics 45 (2014) 406e412  409  ¬º  main effect of the time of the measurement was characterized by the fact that the severity of nausea was signiÔ¨Åcantly higher 2 min after exposure to the simulator (M ¬º 41.34), compared to the results of the measurement taken in the morning of the next day (M ¬º 13.2) p < 0.05; higher 0.5 h after exposure to the simulator (M ¬º 19.9), compared to the results of the measurement taken in the morning of the next day (M ¬º 13.2) p < 0.05; and higher in the evening of the same day (M ¬º 24.91), compared to the results of the the next day (M ¬º 13.2) measurement taken in the morning of p < 0.05. These relationships are illustrated in Fig. 3. Then, we analysed the inÔ¨Çuence of the simulator test conditions and the impact of the time that had elapsed since performing the task in the simulator on the severity of oculomotor disturbances. The main effect of the simulator test conditions proved to be statistically signiÔ¨Åcant, F(2.22) ¬º 5.387, p < 0.01, h2 ¬º 0.329, Œµ ¬º 0.669. The main effect of the time that had elapsed since performing the task in the simulator was also statistically signiÔ¨Åcant, F(4.44) 8.896, p < 0.001, h2 ¬º 0.447, Œµ ¬º 0.521. Similarly, the effect of the in- teractions between the simulator test conditions and the time that had elapsed since performing the task in the simulator proved to be F(8.88) ¬º 3.133, h2 ¬º 0.222, statistically signiÔ¨Åcant, p < 0.01, Œµ ¬º 0.700. Since the interaction effect was statistically signiÔ¨Åcant, the next step of the analysis was to compare the simple effects. Firstly, we decided to check whether the severity of oculomotor disturbances differs between the simulator test conditions at different times of the measurement. The severity of oculomotor disturbances 2 min after exposure to the simulator was signiÔ¨Åcantly higher under the conditions of the motion base platform and good visibility (M ¬º 53.69), compared to those with the Ô¨Åxed base plat- form and good visual conditions (M ¬º 27.16) p < 0.05. Apart from that, the intensity of oculomotor disturbances 0.5 h after exposure to the simulator was signiÔ¨Åcantly higher under the conditions of the motion base platform and good visibility (M ¬º 41.06), compared to those with the Ô¨Åxed base platform and good visual conditions (M ¬º 17.68) p < 0.05, and also compared to those with the Ô¨Åxed base platform and poor visibility (fog) (M ¬º 17.68) p < 0.05. The differ- ences in the severity of oculomotor disturbances were also signiÔ¨Å- cant in the evening of the same day. The intensity of oculomotor disturbances was higher under the conditions with the motion base platform and good visibility (M ¬º 50.53), compared to that observed in the case of the Ô¨Åxed base platform and good visibility (M ¬º 24.01) p < 0.01. To better understand the interaction effect, we also decided to compare how the level of oculomotor disturbances changed within each set of simulator test conditions, depending on the time of the measurement. Under the conditions of the motion base platform and good visibility, the subjects experienced greater severity of oculomotor disturbances 2 min after exposure to the (M ¬º 53.69), simulator compared to the level recorded in the morning of the next day (M ¬º 12.63) p < 0.05. Similar dependencies were also observed for: 0.5 h after exposure to the simulator, as compared to the level noted in the morning of the next day (M ¬º 12.63) p < 0.05, and in the evening of the same day (M ¬º 50.53), compared to the results obtained in the morning of the next day (M ¬º 12.63) p < 0.05. These relationships are illustrated in Fig. 4. The next part of the analysis concerned the impact of the simulator test conditions and the time of the measurement on the severity of the disorientation symptoms. The main effect of the simulator test conditions appeared not to be statistically signiÔ¨Åcant signiÔ¨Åcance, F(2.22) ¬º 2.407, p ¬º 0.113, at the assumed level of h2 ¬º 0.180, Œµ ¬º 0.680. The main effect of the measurement time was statistically signiÔ¨Åcant, F(4.44) ¬º 6.283, p < 0.001, h2 ¬º 0.364, Œµ ¬º 0.406. Similarly, the effect of the interactions between the simulator test conditions and the time of measurement was sta- tistically signiÔ¨Åcant, F(8.88) ¬º 2.197, p < 0.05, h2 ¬º 0.166, Œµ ¬º 0.609. Since the interactions effect was statistically signiÔ¨Åcant, the next  Fig. 1.

The effect size for each signiÔ¨Åcant result was calculated using the eta-squared (h2) measure. Huynh-Feldt epsilons were used in case of sphericity assump- tion violation. Post hoc comparisons were performed with the Bonferroni test. The PASW 19 statistical package (formerly SPSS) was used for all analyses.  4. Results  Descriptive statistics (M and SD) for all measures are reported in Table 2. The Ô¨Årst part of the analysis referred to the inÔ¨Çuence of the simulator test conditions and the time that has elapsed since per- forming the task in the simulator on the severity of nausea. The main effect of the simulator test conditions appeared not to be statistically signiÔ¨Åcant at the assumed level of signiÔ¨Åcance, F(2.22) ¬º 3.003, p ¬º 0.070, h2 ¬º 0.214. The main effect of the statistically signiÔ¨Åcant, F(4.44) ¬º 7.902, measurement time was p < 0.001, h2 ¬º 0.418, Œµ ¬º 0.355. However, the effect of the in- teractions between the simulator test conditions and the time that has elapsed since performing the task in the simulator was not statistically signiÔ¨Åcant, F(8.88) ¬º 0.952, p ¬º 0.479, Œµ ¬º 0.582.

First, it was decided to check whether the severity of the disorientation symptoms is different for various sets of the test conditions at different points of the measurement. The severity of the disorien- tation symptoms 0.5 h after exposure to the simulator was signif- icantly higher under the conditions with the motion base platform and good visibility (M ¬º 44.08), compared to those with the Ô¨Åxed (M ¬º 15.08) p < 0.05. To base platform and poor visibility (fog) better understand the interactions effect, we also decided to check how the level of disorientation changes within each set of simulator test conditions at different times of the measurement. Under the conditions with the motion base platform and good visibility, the subjects experienced a greater severity of disorientation 2 min after exposure to the simulator (M ¬º 71.92), compared to the level noted 0.5 h after exposure to the simulator (M ¬º 44.08) p < 0.05, and compared to that recorded in the morning of the next day (M ¬º 13.92) p < 0.05. These relationships are illustrated in Fig. 5. The Ô¨Ånal stage of data analysis was to examine the impact of the simulator test conditions and the time of the measurement on the  severity of the simulator sickness symptoms expressed by the gen- eral result e SSQ Total. The main effect of the simulator test condi- tions proved to be statistically signiÔ¨Åcant, F(2.22) ¬º 3.721, p < 0.05, h2 ¬º 0.253, Œµ ¬º 0.730. The main effect of the time of the measurement also appeared to be statistically signiÔ¨Åcant, F(4.44) ¬º 7.967, p < 0.001, h2 ¬º 0.420, Œµ ¬º 0.373. Similarly, the effect of the interactions between the simulator test conditions and the time of the measurement was statistically signiÔ¨Åcant, F(8.88) ¬º 2.167, p < 0.05, h2 ¬º 0.165, Œµ ¬º 0.659. Since the interactions effect was statistically signiÔ¨Åcant, the next step of the analysis was to compare the simple effects.

The severity of the simulator sickness symp- toms 0.5 h after exposure to the simulator was signiÔ¨Åcantly higher under the conditions involving the motion base platform and good visibility (M ¬º 43.32), compared to that with the Ô¨Åxed base platform and good visual conditions (M ¬º 20.25) p < 0.05, and compared to the conditions of the Ô¨Åxed base platform and poor visibility (fog)  Fig. 3.

The severity of the simulator sickness symp- toms in the evening of the same day proved to be signiÔ¨Åcantly higher under the conditions of the motion base platform and good visibility (M ¬º 47.06), compared to the conditions with the Ô¨Åxed base platform and good visual conditions (M ¬º 22.12) p < 0.05. To better understand the interactions effect it was also decided to check how the overall level of simulator sickness changes within individual sets of the simulator test conditions at different times of the measurement. Under the conditions with the motion base platform and good visual conditions, the subjects experienced greater severity of simulator sickness 2 min after exposure to the simulator (M ¬º 64.82), compared the next day (M ¬º 14.64) to that experienced in the morning of p < 0.05. The severity of the simulator sickness symptoms was also higher for 0.5 h after exposure to the simulator (M ¬º 43.32) and in the evening of the same day (M ¬º 47.06), compared to that experienced the next day (M ¬º 14.64) p < 0.05. These re- in the morning of lationships are illustrated in Fig. 6.  5. Discussion  Technological development and the subsequent advancement of simulators have led to a simulation of natural human work envi- ronment conditions that is as good as possible. An example of this type of solution is the implementation of motion systems in numerous simulators, including the increasingly popular platforms with 6 DOF. The idea of using the motion base platforms is to increase the Ô¨Ådelity and realism of simulation conditions. Consequently, it is expected that the symptoms of simulator sickness should be reduced (Curry et al., 2002). At the same time, there are studies showing both the positive effects and the lack of signiÔ¨Åcant dif- ferences due to the use of 6 DOF motion systems (McCauley, 2006). The results of our study indicate that the enrichment of the simu- lator test conditions with proprioceptive cues leads to the inten- siÔ¨Åcation of the symptoms of the simulator sickness. It was found that the average level of simulator sickness of all the measurements in good visibility on the motion base platform was higher compared to the level noted for the Ô¨Åxed base platform in good visibility.  These differences relate in particular to oculomotor disturbances and the Total SSQ score. However, there were no statistically sig- niÔ¨Åcant differences observed between the conditions in which vi- sual stimuli were disturbed (fog) compared to good visibility conditions on the motion and Ô¨Åxed base platform. Analyses of the results averaged of all measurements for each type of test condi- tions also showed that in the conditions of poor visibility, the SSQ proÔ¨Åle had the form of N > D > O and in the case of good visibility conditions, both on the motion and Ô¨Åxed base platform, the SSQ proÔ¨Åle was as follows: D > O > N. The average level of D and O was at a similar level. Another issue was how long speciÔ¨Åc simulator sickness symp- toms persist. In the case of complaints related to nausea, the highest level was observed in the 2 min after exposure to the simulator conditions and 0.5h after exposure to such conditions. The disorientation level was the highest in the 2 min after exposure to the simulator. The oculomotor disturbances persisted for the longest period of time, i.e. until the evening of the same day. It turns out that the severity of most symptoms of simulator sickness is impacted upon both by the simulator task conditions and the time that has elapsed since performing the task in the simulator. What is more interesting, in the case of symptoms associated with oculomotor disturbances, disorientation and the total simulator sickness symptoms (total SSQ), is that it was observed that the simulator test conditions affect the intensity of the simulator sickness symptoms in different ways, depending on the time that has elapsed since performing the task in the simu- lator. The above-mentioned symptoms of simulator sickness (ocu- lomotor disturbances, disorientation and the total simulator sickness symptoms) persisted for the longest period of time, especially in the case of the motion base platform and good visibility. The SSQ proÔ¨Åles obtained in our study for the motion base platform and the Ô¨Åxed one are the same as those presented in the work of Curry et al. (2002). However, the SSQ proÔ¨Åle obtained in our study for the motion base platform is much higher than the proÔ¨Åle for the Ô¨Åxed base platform. What is more, the fact that the average values of all the test trials for disorientation and oculo- motor disturbances symptoms are similar does not mean that both  
412  ≈Åukasz Dziuda et al.  / Applied Ergonomics 45 (2014) 406e412  of these conditions have the same course. The symptoms of disorientation as a result of the exposure to the test conditions with the motion base platform are rapidly intensiÔ¨Åed immediately after completion of the task on the simulator and then they gradually fade away. On the other hand, although oculomotor disturbances resulting from the exposure to the test conditions on the motion base platform are also intensiÔ¨Åed just after the completion of the task on the simulator, they persist longer e until the evening of the day on which the examination took place. The results obtained in this study are of interest in light of the data presented by Baltzley et al. (1989) which showed that 25% of the simulator sickness symptoms persisted for more than 1 h and 8% of the symptoms persisted for over 6 h after the end of the simulator test. It is possible that the persistence of the symptoms over a long time relates particularly to oculomotor disturbances. This issue requires further study on a larger number of subjects. As noted earlier, it is assumed that the use of the motion base platform may, by better reÔ¨Çecting natural conditions, reduce the symptoms of simulator sickness. The results obtained in this study indicate the opposite. Implementing the motion base platform may provide an additional source of conÔ¨Çict. In our opinion, the mismatch between the true motion of the vehicle and the motion produced by simulator actuators can in fact induce or increase simulator sickness. It seems, then, that the closer the conditions in the simulator get to the real conditions (by involving a wider range of cues), the greater the risk of conÔ¨Çict and, as a consequence, of simulator sickness. Thus, it seems crucial to look at the perfor- mance of the tasks in the simulator from the perspective of their usefulness and purpose for which they are applied. Undoubtedly, the phenomenon of simulator sickness must be minimized. If, however, it is not possible to eliminate this phenomenon, it seems necessary to take into account the severity of simulator sickness in the analysis of the variables recorded during the performance of the simulation tasks. The results of our study may therefore be both of practical importance for persons carrying out studies and of theoretical importance when used while dealing with theoretical models of simulator sickness.

s0003687013001142,"  The use of information and communication technologies (ICT) by children has been associated with musculoskeletal discomfort (Burke and Peper, 2002; Harris and Straker, 2000; Jacobs and Baker, 2002; Ramos et al., 2005; Straker et al., 2009). This is concerning as children are still physically developing, and there might be negative long-term consequences on their physical health (Straker et al., 2009). There are no risk assessment tools speciÔ¨Åcally developed to assess postural risks in children. However, researchers have pre- viously used the Ovako Working Posture Analysing System (OWAS) (Karhu et al., 1977) and the Rapid Upper Limb Assessment (RULA) (McAtamney and Corlett, 1993), both originally developed to assess adult workers, to assess postural risks among children in school  * Corresponding author.

The use of RULA to assess children‚Äôs posture has been reported more extensively in the scientiÔ¨Åc literature (Breen et al., 2007; Dockrell et al., 2010, 2012; Kelly et al., 2009; Laeser et al., 1998; Oates et al., 1998) than the OWAS (Saarni et al., 2007a, 2007b).  1.1.  Rapid Upper Limb Assessment  The RULA is an observation-based screening tool used to quickly assess an individual‚Äôs exposure to load factors due to posture, muscle function and forces they exert. Administration of the tool is simple to learn and does not require the use of special equipment or pre-existing skills in observation techniques (McAtamney and Corlett, 1993). The RULA involves assigning: 1) a numerical rating to the posture of the upper limbs, neck, trunk and legs, and 2) another numerical rating for additional factors that strain the musculoskeletal system, such as repetitive action, static loading and force exertion. These ratings are scored according to an algo- rithm to obtain a Grand Score ranging from 1 to 7, and an Action Level ranging from 1 to 4 that has associated implications for remedial action (Table 1).

Prior ergonomics studies have used the RULA to assess the postures of children when performing academic tasks at computer workstations in school environments; in these studies the chil- dren‚Äôs postures were inÔ¨Çuenced by the classroom furniture (Breen et al., 2007; Dockrell et al., 2010, 2012; Kelly et al., 2009; Laeser et al., 1998; Oates et al., 1998). No prior studies have used the RULA to perform postural risk assessments in home environments wherein children have high exposure to mobile ICT for leisure (Rideout et al., 2010), and use ICT for longer durations than when at school (Ciccarelli et al., 2011; Kent and Facer, 2004; Kerawalla and Crook, 2002).  1.2. Visual search  Due to the observational nature of risk assessments, visual search is an essential skill utilized by the assessor. Visual search depends primarily on eye behaviours of saccades and Ô¨Åxations (Falkmer et al., 2008; Liversedge and Findlay, 2000; Yang et al., 2002). Saccades are the voluntary rapid eye movements that direct the eye to points of interest in the environment; no visual information is projected on the fovea during this movement (Fuchs, 1971). Fixations are periods of gaze stability that occur between saccades (Duchowski, 2007). During Ô¨Åxations, the eye is directed such that information from the environment is projected onto the fovea, registered and processed (Fuchs, 1971). It is recognized that visual attention can be inÔ¨Çuenced by characteristics of the visual environment (bottomeup) and cogni- tive processes (topedown) (Henderson, 2003; Wolfe et al., 1989). Bottomeup factors that can affect visual attention include salient characteristics of the visual scene such as movement, contrast, and colour. On the other hand, topedown cognitive processes are related to short-term visual memory of the present scene, long- term memory about similar scenes and knowledge related to the visual search task (Henderson, 2003). During skilled, purposeful and active search, topedown cognitive processes tend to inÔ¨Çuence visual attention more than bottomeup processes (Henderson, 2003; Yang et al., 2002). The Ô¨Åxation point is assumed to reÔ¨Çect the focus of attention in a topedown approach (Henderson, 2003), and therefore is commonly used to provide an insight into the cognitive processes involved during visual search tasks (Falkmer et al., 2008).  2007; Underwood et al., 2002). Experienced gymnastics coaches displayed fewer numbers of Ô¨Åxations, but longer Ô¨Åxation durations, during evaluation of gymnastics routines (Moreno et al., 2002). Training in a systematic visual search strategy for a visual inspec- tion task resulted in improved task performance (Wang et al., 1997). These studies showed that experience and training could make a difference in visual search strategies and the interpretation of in- formation obtained from visual search (Yang et al., 2002). However, it is not known if this is the case in postural risk assessment scenarios.  1.3. Aims of  the study  The aims of this study were to determine differences between experienced and novice assessors in their RULA scores (Grand Scores and Action Levels) and their visual search strategies during a postural risk assessment of a child using mobile ICT in the home environment.  2.

s0003687013001154,"  Fire service personnel are often the Ô¨Årst people called upon when evacuating large multi-story buildings during both emer- gency and non-emergency conditions, for example, extended power outages. During such evacuations, Ô¨ÅreÔ¨Åghters (FF) may need to transport building occupants with motor disabilities down several Ô¨Çights of stairs. Epidemiologic data from Emer- gency Medical Service (EMS) workers suggest that such tasks are often associated with injury development (Gershon et al., 1995; Hogya and Ellis, 1990; Karter and Molis, 2011; Maguire et al., 2005). Furber et al. (1997) , in their study of 477 workers‚Äô compensation claims made by Australian ambulance workers, found that within private residences stairs were a strong factor contributing to injuries reported by ambulance ofÔ¨Åcers. Our prior work , comparing simulated stair descents with a hand- carried stair chair, a backboard, and a stretcher, found that  * Corresponding author.

Stair transport tasks can be done by using one- or two-person manual carry techniques or, if available, by using one of several different types of stair descent devices. Hand-carried evacuation chairs are commonly used by Ô¨Åre department personnel and often found on emergency response vehicles. Alternatively, emergency stair descent devices may be owned by building oc- cupants or building owners and used by Ô¨Åre service personnel during evacuations. While several stair descent devices or ‚Äúevacuation chairs‚Äù are currently on the market for emergency evacuation of individuals with motor disabilities from high rise buildings, there is little empirical data indicating their impact on the physical demands placed on the Ô¨ÅreÔ¨Åghter who may be called upon to use these hand-carried chairs. The National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) Life Safety Code indicates that when descending stairs, an evacuation device should be easily operable by one person who is trained on its use, and that above average weight or strength should not be required for proper  0003-6870/$ e see front matter √ì 2013 Elsevier Ltd and The Ergonomics Society.

More- over, subtle changes in equipment design can have substantial effects on the physical demands, especially when stair descent tasks include turns on landings (Lavender et al., 2007a,b; Fredericks et al., 2002). For example, Lavender et al. (2007a,b), found that changing handle locations on stair chairs signiÔ¨Åcantly affected 90th percentile muscle recruitment levels as different chair handle conÔ¨Ågurations were carried through a landing. Fredericks et al. (2002) reported differences in spine compres- sion estimated using the static strength prediction program across four types of hand-carried stair chairs. They found that designs that supported the lead person facing forwards when descending the stairs resulted in lower spine compression values for this lead individual. Evacuation conditions including the staircase width and the urgency of the evacuation may also impact the physical de- mands on the Ô¨ÅreÔ¨Åghters, particularly if the stair descent in- volves landings where the direction of travel changes. Drury (1985) provided evidence that task performance measures, for example task duration or movement speed, are dependent upon the available space, at least up to the point where space no longer potentially restricts movement. Likewise, Karwowski and Alsabi (1991) reported a trend toward a lower acceptable weight of lift with more restricted lifting spaces. This implies that staircase dimensions could impact muscle recruitment levels as smaller versus larger landings are negotiated by evacuators. As for urgency, several studies have shown increases in biome- chanical loading as movement speed increases (Marras, 2008). Under urgent evacuation conditions, one could expect more rapid motions, and perhaps more co-contraction of antagonistic muscles as the body is stabilized under the increased dynamic external loads. The objective of this study was to compare biomechanical and physiological demands on Ô¨ÅreÔ¨Åghters as they used three existing hand-carried stair descent devices and a two-person manual carry without a chair. SpeciÔ¨Åcally, the following hypotheses were tested:  1. There are signiÔ¨Åcant differences among existing hand-carried stair descent devices with regards to task performance mea- sures and the physical demands placed on evacuators as measured via heart rate, electromyography, and subjective measures of perceived exertion. 2. The physical demands on the evacuator increase with narrower staircases. 3. The physical demands on the evacuator increase during urgent conditions. 4. The physical demands placed on the Ô¨ÅreÔ¨Åghters are dependent upon the combined effects of chair design, staircase width, and the level of evacuation urgency.  Additionally, the study assessed usability issues with each of the evaluated devices through video analysis and a structured inter- view process.  2. "
s0003687013001166,"  In-Vehicle Information Systems (IVISs) have gained in popu- larity for drivers over the last few years. In general, IVISs include navigation systems, entertainment systems such as music/video players and satellite broadcasting receivers, and various car man- agement systems. IVISs are operated mainly by virtual controls on touch-screen interfaces, by physical controls such as knobs and buttons, or by voice recognition systems. Among these methods, especially for aftermarket products, touch-screen interfaces are the most prevailing methods for operating IVISs. A touch-screen interface is one of the most natural and intuitive interfaces, and typical input is a natural pointing gesture; as a result, training is minimized (Greenstein, 1997; Scott and Conzola, 1997). In addition, they require no additional input devices such as physical keys or a mouse; therefore, the dimension of a device can be minimized (Holzinger, 2003; Scott and Conzola, 1997).

In most cases, touch-screen interfaces, especially for IVISs, are manipulated by Ô¨Ångers. For Ô¨Ånger interactions, Pfauth and Priest (1981) identiÔ¨Åed that the touch-key size is the main factor in the design of the touch-screen interfaces. As the touch-key size de- creases below a certain level, usability measurements such as the task completion time, accuracy, and subjective ratings are signiÔ¨Å- cantly degraded compared to physical keys. This degradation could be attributed to a lack of tactile feedback (there is no engraved surface between neighboring keys) and visual feedback (the target is occluded by the Ô¨Ångers). Many studies that focus on touch-key sizes have been conducted on relatively large touch-screen in- terfaces such as kiosks and ATM machines, which are mainly manipulated by the index Ô¨Ånger (Bender, 1999; Beringer, 1990; Colle and Hiszem, 2004; Hall et al., 1988; Scott and Conzola, 1997; Sears, 1991), and on small interfaces such as PDAs and mobile phones, which focus on one-handed thumb uses (Parhi et al., 2006; Park and Han, 2010; Perry and Hourcade, 2008). However, as far as the authors are aware, there is no published study of touch-key sizes that focuses on IVISs. The purpose of the previous studies on the touch-key size was mostly to investigate the effect of the touch-key size on the usability of the touch-screen interfaces and to, thereby, determine  0003-6870/$ e see front matter √ì 2013 Elsevier Ltd and The Ergonomics Society.

380  H. Kim et al.  / Applied Ergonomics 45 (2014) 379e388  the proper touch-key sizes for speciÔ¨Åc touch-screen devices. However, a study on the touch-key size for IVISs needs to focus on the driving safety together with the usability of the IVISs. Inter- acting with IVISs is often a secondary task that is performed while conducting a primary task, which is driving. According to the multiple-resource theory of attention, humans have only a limited amount of attention that is available at any given time (Navon and Gopher, 1979; Wickens, 1984). When users perform a secondary task while conducting a primary task, the amount of attention to the primary task is reduced, and the performance of both the pri- mary and secondary task is decreased (Sanders and McComick, 1993; Vollrath and Trotzke, 2000). The performance degradation in the secondary task becomes larger as the demand for resources made by the primary task increases (Sanders and McComick, 1993). The result of Tsimhoni et al. (2004) is an example, of how the secondary task performance (in terms of task completion time for entering address into a navigation system) decreased as the pri- mary task workload of driving (in terms of road curvature) increased. The performance degradation in dual tasks was found to be ampliÔ¨Åed when both the primary and secondary tasks required the same human resources (Brookhuis et al., 1991; Lee, 2007; Schweitzer and Green, 2007; Sodnik et al., 2008; Tsimhoni et al., 2004). Lee (2007) showed that text messaging while driving could interfere with driving much more than conversing on a mobile phone. Brookhuis et al. (1991) empirically showed that manual input while driving causes more interference on driving than conversing on a mobile phone. Sodnik et al. (2008) experi- mentally showed that the visual interface of text messaging and calling causes more interference with driving and also causes a higher workload for the users compared with an auditory interface. Tsimhoni et al. (2004) showed that, when drivers use a touch- screen keyboard to enter addresses while driving, the lateral de- viation and the number of lane crossings was higher than when a voice recognition system was used. Interacting with IVISs while driving is deÔ¨Ånitely a case in which the primary and secondary tasks are performed simultaneously and require the same human resources, such as visual processing, cognitive processing and motor control. In line with the above fact, many studies have re- ported that driving performance decreased and safety risks increased when the participants were interacting with IVISs while driving (Alm and Nilsson, 1995; Glcukman et al., 1988; Gopher, 1990; Horrey et al., 2006; Hosking et al., 2009; Janelle et al., 1999; Salvucci, 2001; Salvucci et al., 2007). In such a risky case, an improper touch-key size could increase the level of difÔ¨Åculty of interacting with IVISs and could lead to a further increase in interference to driving. In turn, improper touch-key sizes could not only decrease the usability of IVISs but also increase the safety risks. Strictly speaking, it might be most desirable not to use IVISs while driving. However, considering the current trend of private vehicles becoming mobile ofÔ¨Åces, using the IVISs while driving is inevitable in spite of the safety risks (Sodnik et al., 2008). Another interesting issue that is related to pointing tasks is Fitts‚Äô law (Fitts, 1954). Fitts‚Äô law has been widely used in the Ô¨Åeld of HumaneComputer Interaction to quantify the performance of hu- man pointing tasks by logarithmically relating the movement time, the target width and the movement amplitude. Fitts‚Äô law works well for a variety of user interfaces in which various body parts are used to interact with different input devices and targets (Mackenzie, 1992). There are also several studies that investigated Fitts‚Äô law speciÔ¨Åcally in touch-screen devices (Bender, 1999; Colle and Hiszem, 2004; Mackenzie and Zhang, 2001; Parhi et al., 2006; Sears, 1991; Sears and Shneiderman, 1991; Sears and Zha, 2003). Bender (1999) investigated target acquisition tasks that used a numeric keypad with touch-key sizes of 10  10 mm and 30  30 mm and performed Fitts‚Äô law analysis. The results were  consistent with the predictions of Fitts‚Äô law. Mackenzie and Zhang (2001) investigated typing tasks that used a touch-keypad with key-sizes of 6.4  6.4 mm and 10  10 mm. The results from the analysis of the entry speed and key-size were also consistent with the Fitts‚Äô law prediction. Parhi et al. (2006) explored single-target pointing tasks on small touchscreen devices, and the results are consistent with Fitts‚Äô law. While the results of these studies were consistent with Fitts‚Äô law, there were few studies of touch-key pointing tasks that were not consistent with Fitts‚Äô law (Colle and Hiszem, 2004; Sears, 1991; Sears and Shneiderman, 1991; Sears and Zha, 2003). This inconsistency could arise because cursor pointing with a touch-screen is inherently different than pointing with most other devices (Sears and Shneiderman, 1991). In other words, when compared to traditional pointing tasks, touch-key pointing tasks required choice (visual scanning) and motor pro- gramming processes in addition to movement (Colle and Hiszem, 2004). All of these studies were performed in the context of the single task of pointing to touch-keys, although the results of the previous studies were dissimilar; however, there were no studies that investigated it in the context of dual tasks, especially for interacting with IVISs while driving. Under dual task conditions, humans cannot fully concentrate on the secondary task (interacting with IVISs) because their attention is allocated to both the primary task and the secondary task. The time that is required to achieve the secondary task is limited because they must drive safely simulta- neously. For this reason, the results from the dual tasks are not expected to be in line with Fitts‚Äô law. Fitts‚Äô law analysis of our data was performed in the discussion section. In this study, the effects of the touch-key size on driving safety together with the usability of IVISs were experimentally investi- gated through driving simulation. SpeciÔ¨Åcally, the standard devia- tion of the lane position, speed variation, and glance behavior were investigated with respect to driving safety, and the task completion time, error rate, subjective preference and workload (NASA-TLX) were measured with respect to the usability of IVISs. Additionally, we performed Fitts‚Äô law analysis on our data.  2. "
s0003687013001178,"  1.1.  The need for emergency vehicle lighting  The work of emergency service vehicles is inherently hazardous. A report by the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) states that there were between 11,000 and 19,000 police pursuits in England and Wales during 2005/06 and estimates between one and eleven pursuits out of every 1000 lead to a death (Docking et al., 2007). Statistics gathered by the Police Roll of Honour Trust (2010) indicate that between April 2000 and March 2010, there were 143 reported cases of Police OfÔ¨Åcers who died in the line of duty in the UK, the majority in road trafÔ¨Åc accidents. Emergency medical ser- vices personnel also have a risk of occupational death that is dis- proportionally high, due largely to transportation-related fatalities (Slattery and Silver, 2009). Additionally trafÔ¨Åc collisions are the second most common cause of death for Ô¨Åre Ô¨Åghters (Vrachnou, 2003). These Ô¨Åndings are not simply due to the amount of driving undertaken by emergency services personnel. For ambulances, emergency driving carries a risk that is far greater than non- emergency ambulance driving (Kahn et al., 2001; Fr√∏yland, 1982).

Tel.: √æ44 01273 704432. E-mail address: sally@userperspective.co.uk (S. Turner).  Research also indicates that emergency driving by the emer- gency services presents a risk to the general public. A recent report by the IPCC indicates that during the year 2008/2009, 40 members of the public died in England and Wales following road trafÔ¨Åc ac- cidents arising from police pursuits and other police trafÔ¨Åc-related activity (IPCC, 2009). In terms of connotations for public spending, three Yorkshire Police forces in combination have reportedly spent ¬£4.3 million on repairs, legal fees and compensation over a three year period, as a result of crashes involving 1965 police vehicles (Preece, 2010). There is a particular necessity for emergency vehicle lighting (EVL) to alert the public to the vehicle‚Äôs presence and thereby reduce the potential for accidents. This is demonstrated by the Ô¨Ånding that for accidents at intersections, ambulances are far more likely to be struck rather than strike another vehicle (Geis and Madsen, 2001). The importance of EVL as a warning system, together with the propensity of accidents involving emergency service vehicles indicates there is a justiÔ¨Åed requirement to improve its effectiveness.  1.2.  Effectiveness of EVL  EVL has two primary functions in protecting the public and emergency service personnel: (1) to draw attention of nearby pe- destrians and drivers; (2) to provide basic information about the situation to enable those drivers and pedestrians to take appro- priate action (Cook et al., 1999).

Effectiveness in drawing attention of pedestrians/drivers  A key factor determining the efÔ¨Åcacy of EVL, is whether it affords greater conspicuity of the emergency vehicle. Conspicuity refers to the target‚Äôs size, luminance, contrast and colour in relation to its background (e.g. Cole and Hughes, 1984; MacDonald and Cole, 1988). EVL tends to pulse and there is support for the supposition that a Ô¨Çashing light affords greater conspicuity than a steady burning light of equivalent intensity (Schmidt-Clausen, 1999). Indeed the periph- eral detection of motorbikes is doubled with the use of a Ô¨Çashing rather than steady headlamp (Donne and Fulton, 1988). This conspicuity improvement has also been observed with industrial machinery, the detection time of a moving mining machine was reduced by 75% when a warning system employing Ô¨Çashing lights was used (Sammarco et al., 2012). There is evidence to suggest the human visual system is hard-wired to pay special attention to Ô¨Çashing rather than steady lights, as exempliÔ¨Åed by gaze patterns of infants (Teller, 1979; Teller and Movshon, 1986; Jouen, 1990). The greater conspicuity afforded by a pulsing rather than steady light would therefore appear to be an innate rather than learned response. However research attests to the situational nature of conspicuity, i.e. a Ô¨Çashing light will only stand out from its background if this does not contain an excess of Ô¨Çashing lights and it is dependent on the complexity of the road environment in general (Berkhout et al., 1999; Cook et al., 1999; Treisman, 1986; review in Enns, 1990). Accepting these situational variables, preliminary research suggests the char- acteristics of the Ô¨Çash rate and pattern of EVL affect its conspicuity or ease of detection, as discussed below. However there is a marked lack of research in this area and some Ô¨Åndings conÔ¨Çict.  1) Detection according to Ô¨Çash rate: The effect of Ô¨Çash rate on detection is complicated by its dual effect on apparent bright- ness, therefore Ô¨Çashing lights require additional intensity to be detected as quickly as a steady light (Paine and Fisher, 1996; Sagawa, 1999). Although their research only involved the testing of yellow and amber lights, Hanscom and Pain (1990) found that altering Ô¨Çash rates (60e100 cycles per minute) and light intensities did not have a measurable effect on observer responses. In contrast, Cook et al. (1999) found bea- cons with higher Ô¨Çash rates were more detectable in laboratory trials (from 1 Hz to 4 Hz). More recent research by an unnamed author reported in Wells‚Äô review (2004) also indicates that lights are detected more quickly when a faster Ô¨Çash rate is employed. There is a limit to the speed of Ô¨Çash rate that is advisable however. At 20 Hz the light will appear to be constant (thereby cancelling out the conspicuity gain), Ô¨Çash rates be- tween 10 and 20 Hz are most likely to trigger an epileptogenic response in a person with epilepsy and rates above 5 Hz are associated with reports of increased eye-strain and headaches (Ice Ergonomics, 2002; Jeavons and Harding, 1975; Wells, 2004). In addition increasing Ô¨Çash rates are associated with increasing levels of glare and annoyance (Cook et al., 1999). 2) Detection according to Ô¨Çash pattern: Multiple Ô¨Çashes rather than equally spaced single Ô¨Çashes tend to be used in aviation because they are perceived to be more conspicuous, which may be because the initial Ô¨Çash gains attention and the following Ô¨Çash directs gaze (King, 1999; Schmidt-Clausen, 1999). There is evidence to indicate that double pulse Ô¨Çash patterns are more conspicuous than single pulse, while sequential patterns  (rather than concurrent) are detected more quickly and are rated as more attention-grabbing (Cook et al., 1999). However there is also the view that concurrent light Ô¨Çashes are more optimal for detection because they have the effect of outlining the vehicle (Lamm, 1983). Again the issue with enhancing conspicuity by altering Ô¨Çash characteristics is an increased risk of discomfort and disability glare (Cook et al.; Lamm).  1.2.2. Effectiveness in providing basic information about the situation to facilitate safe avoidance action  At present statistics suggest that EVL does not help to clear the path for emergency services on the public roads to the desired extent. For example ambulances observed in the U.S. completed their routes 43.5 s faster in one study, and 1 min, 46 s faster in another with the use of warning lights and sirens (Brown et al., 2000; Hunt et al., 1995). The larger difference in journey time was statistically signiÔ¨Åcant but not considered to be of practical beneÔ¨Åt (Brown et al., 2000). This research might indicate that drivers do not understand the urgency implied by lights and sirens, or it may indicate that some motorists do not make avoidance manoeuvres effectively. A natural reaction for some motorists is confusion and panic according to the claims data of NRMA insur- ance (Drive, 2008). Additionally if the emergency service vehicle does not allow the driver time to observe the warnings and make the manoeuvre, delays may occur. By way of illustration Green (2000) found it took approximately 1.5 s to move the foot from accelerator to brake pedal in response to surprise events. There is evidence to suggest that Ô¨Çashing, non-emergency vehicle lights could facilitate safe avoidance action. In a video- based driving simulation, Isler and Starkey (2010) used Ô¨Çashing hazard lights to warn that the vehicle in front was braking: a 19% improvement in speed of response to the braking manoeuvre was observed in comparison to the standard warning of illuminated brake lights. Of course the improvement observed in Isler & Star- key‚Äôs study may be primarily due to the additional illumination of hazard lights rather than their Ô¨Çash characteristics, however this does imply that vehicle lighting can be utilised to positively impact driver behaviour. In order to prevent accidents it would be pref- erable if emergency lighting discouraged driving behaviours that could be risky with a fast-moving vehicle, such as pulling out in front of it. This particular behaviour has been measured by asking participants when they would pull out in front of another vehicle at the last possible moment, a judgment termed ‚Äògap acceptance‚Äô (Pietras, et al., 2006). This study found that this measure differen- tiated between attention-impaired and unimpaired older drivers, Ô¨Ånding that time to contact values were shorter (i.e. gap acceptance values were riskier) amongst attention-impaired drivers.  1.2.3.  Effectiveness in communicating hazard & urgency  Although there is a lack of research in this area, EVL could provide numerous beneÔ¨Åts if it could convey more complex infor- mation such as the urgency of the situation, i.e. urgency perception (Cook et al., 1999, 2000). Research indicates that light colour affects perceived hazard and lighting technology affects perceived urgency (Chan and Ng, 2009; Ullman et al., 1998). There is evidence that Ô¨Çash rate and pattern of emergency lighting also affects percep- tions of urgency. Cook and colleagues (1999) established that a blue light with a higher Ô¨Çash rate enhances perceived urgency in com- parison to lower Ô¨Çash rates. More recent research also shows that hazard perception (i.e. how hazardous a situation appears to be) increases with increasing Ô¨Çash rates, with a particular impression of urgency achieved at 4 Hz (Chan and Ng, 2009). Flash pattern research has suggested single pulse patterns be- tween 4 Hz and 5 Hz enhance urgency perception (Van Cott and  Please cite this article in press as: Turner, S., et al., Determining optimum Ô¨Çash patterns for emergency service vehicles: An experimental investigation using high deÔ¨Ånition Ô¨Ålm, Applied Ergonomics (2013), http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2013.05.007  
S. Turner et al.  / Applied Ergonomics xxx (2013) 1e7  3  Kinkade, 1972). While more recent research found that a double pulse pattern increased hazard perception to a greater degree than a single pulse pattern (Chan and Ng, 2009). It would be expected that hazard and urgency perception would be related to some de- gree, therefore this discrepancy is surprising. Chan and Ng‚Äôs Ô¨Ånding that a Ô¨Çash rate of 1 Hz is ineffective at enhancing hazard percep- tion, may suggest that there is scope to develop a low urgency Ô¨Çash mode and a high urgency mode to provide the public with more information. Urgency mapping with the use of Ô¨Çash rates has been recommended by prominent researchers in this Ô¨Åeld (Cook et al., 1999; Sanders and McCormick, 1993).  1.3.  Study aims  Broadly speaking the research reviewed implies that detection time, and perceptions of hazard and urgency could be altered with the use of Ô¨Çash rates and patterns. However it is not clear exactly which combination of Ô¨Çash pattern and Ô¨Çash rate is optimal, because some study Ô¨Åndings conÔ¨Çict and other studies have not necessarily examined the joint effect of Ô¨Çash rate and pattern. The advantages of particular Ô¨Çash characteristics could be cancelled out or enhanced when EVL variables are examined in conjunction. This study sought to clarify this issue by investigating the effect of EVL Ô¨Çash rate and pattern combinations on measures which have featured in previous research. However to the author‚Äôs knowledge, there are no published studies on the effect of EVL characteristics on gap acceptance, which may be more indicative of a driver‚Äôs likely behaviour in a given situation rather than just his/her perception of it. This study attempted to address this shortfall in the literature by exploring the question of whether Ô¨Çash combinations which pro- duced greater perceptions of hazard and/or urgency would also promote less risky gap acceptance judgements. Recent developments in high deÔ¨Ånition (HD) technology allow stimulus materials to be displayed with greater clarity (and thereby with potentially greater realism) than has been possible previously. A secondary aim of this study was to investigate whether the exposure of participants to HD Ô¨Ålm clips could produce meaningful results without the use of more resource-intensive methods like scale models and simulators. For example the observational research design by Ullman et al. (1998) does not allow for partici- pants to be questioned directly and the resources necessary to develop an ecologically valid model environment (like that re- ported in Cook et al.‚Äôs (1999) study) were unavailable in the present context. Other researchers have used video as a stimulus material, for example Chapman and Underwood (1998) used video to determine eye movement patterns from the perspective of a driver. It was reasoned that stimulus materials consisting of HD Ô¨Ålm could provide the most realistic environmental depiction of EVL charac- teristics, while also being reliable, minimising risk to participants but still allowing insight into their decision-making. To support this method, a statistical review was undertaken to determine the most common characteristics of accidents involving police vehicles, enabling stimulus materials to depict those conditions more commonly associated with these accidents.  2.  Study 1:  incident data review  2.1. Method summary  An analysis of road trafÔ¨Åc accidents involving police vehicles in the UK was undertaken by Andrew Morrow (2010) of the Home OfÔ¨Åce Centre for Applied Science and Technology (CAST). This uti- lised STATS 19 data, the data collection system used by the Police to record all road trafÔ¨Åc incidents resulting in personal injury. The STATS 19 data for 2005 to 2008 were selected for all incidents  Ô¨Çagged as ‚Äòemergency vehicle on a call‚Äô and where a police ofÔ¨Åcer attended the scene (3049 incidents).  2.2.  Results summary  A detailed description of the results can be obtained from the authors of this article. Key Ô¨Åndings were that the majority of in- cidents took place:  B In 30 mph zones (72%) B On single carriageways (71%) B At T or staggered junctions (30%) or crossroads, (25%) B During daylight (60%) B In Ô¨Åne, dry conditions with no high winds (55%).  Of the 5197 casualty reports, car occupants were more likely to be killed or seriously injured (78%) than any other road user. There were more male (63%) than female casualties (37%). Of the fatal and seriously injured casualties, 84% of them fell into the age range of 16e55 years. These results were used to determine the scenario and partici- pant pool for the main study, so that the most hazardous conditions for accidents involving emergency vehicles on call featured as part of the experiment.  3.  : Study 2: experimental  investigation of responses to EVL  3.1. Method  3.1.1. Design  This was a scoping study designed to explore whether a large- scale research project utilising this method for determining optimal EVL characteristics is feasible and valid. The experimental conditions featured Ô¨Ålm clips of a livered police vehicle, in which the lightbar was set to a combination of two key variables: Ô¨Çash rate (two levels: 1 Hz and 4 Hz) and Ô¨Çash pattern (single or triple pulse) in a repeated-measures design. There were therefore four ‚ÄòEVL conditions‚Äô. Also included was a ‚ÄòNo Lights‚Äô condition, in which the police car featured no EVL at all in the clip. This condition was included to provide a baseline to ensure participants were not solely reacting to the police vehicle‚Äôs livery. The following variables were measured to understand whether particular combinations have a conspicuity/interpretation advantage:  1) Reaction time: deÔ¨Åned as the time taken for the participant to detect a road-user and pause the clip (by pressing the mouse wheel). 2) Gap acceptance: the last possible moment participants perceived they would be comfortable pulling out in front of the approaching vehicle (signalled by the timecode at which the clip was paused). A greater number signals a smaller gap acceptance (therefore a more risky driving manoeuvre); a similar method was employed by Pietras et al. (2006). 3) Hazard perception: perceived hazard of the general situation, on a scale of 1 (no hazard) to 5 (extremely hazardous). 4) Urgency perception: perceived urgency of the road-user dis- played in the clip, on a scale of 1 (no urgency) to 5 (very urgent). 5) Urgency ranking: perceived urgency of the four EVL conditions in comparison to one another, in ranks (where necessary ranks were shared).  3.1.2.  Participants  40 participants were recruited from employees of the Sussex Innovation Centre and resident businesses. Recruitment advertisements called for regular drivers between the ages of 18e  Please cite this article in press as: Turner, S., et al., Determining optimum Ô¨Çash patterns for emergency service vehicles: An experimental investigation using high deÔ¨Ånition Ô¨Ålm, Applied Ergonomics (2013), http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2013.05.007

Partici- pants were screened for photosensitive epilepsy and recent expe- rience (within one year) of a serious road trafÔ¨Åc accident in a pre- test questionnaire. These criteria were designed to exclude partic- ipants for ethical reasons, although no potential participants met these criteria. Participants were paid ¬£10 for undertaking the 30 min experiment (paid prior to testing to reduce demand char- acteristics). All participants were conÔ¨Årmed to have normal to corrected vision prior to commencing the study. A Ô¨Ånal sample of 37 participants was attained (3 did not participate). Of the sample 56.8% (n ¬º 21) were male and the average age was 33.8 years (SD ¬º 9.39), ranging from 22 to 53 years. Participants had held their driving licence on average for 14 years (SD ¬º 8.50), and were pre- dominantly regular drivers 91.9% (driving ‚Äòa few times a week or more‚Äô). All participants passed the basic visual acuity test admin- istered prior to participation.  3.1.3. Materials  Materials consisted of Ô¨Ålm clips of different EVL combinations displayed by an LED (911 Emergency Products Galaxy) lightbar, which was mounted on a 1996 Vauxhall Omega saloon police vehicle. Only the front central sections (rather than end sections) were used during Ô¨Ålming. The emergency vehicle is shown in Fig. 1 below. Fig. 2 shows the emergency vehicle in a frame of a Ô¨Ånal Ô¨Ålm clip. Further information on the police vehicle and Ô¨Ålming proce- dure is available from the authors. Filler materials featured either no vehicles at all, or a ‚Äònon-emergency‚Äô vehicle: a blue Reliant Robin, black Jaguar XK8 convertible, blue Citroen Berlingo, and silver Vauxhall ZaÔ¨Åra. Materials were Ô¨Ålmed from the perspective of the driver, as if they were waiting at a junction and looking through their right window (to tally with the Ô¨Åndings from Study 1). All vehicles were travelling at 30 mph (apart from one non-emergency vehicle), to ensure consistency in the Ô¨Ålm clips. The location, Ô¨Ålming conditions and Ô¨Ålming procedure were all selected in order to reduce vari- ability and artefacts of the Ô¨Ålming process. Footage was edited into a Ô¨Ånal set of HD video clips, which varied between 5 and 13.8 s and featured a time code. The clips were trimmed so that each vehicle would appear in the same location at the start of each clip. Two playlists were compiled so that the clips could be run in two orders, enabling them to be counterbalanced between participants, to reduce the problem of order and practice effects.  Fig. 1. The test vehicle with end modules of the lightbar Ô¨Çashing.  Fig. 2. The test vehicle as featured in the stimulus materials, with only central modules of the lightbar Ô¨Çashing.  The stimulus material constituted 24 clips of HD video feed, with a ‚Äòcountdown clip‚Äô interspersed between, which lasted ten seconds. These featured two repetitions of each of the Ô¨Åve clips that contained the police vehicle (41.7% of clips), with an average duration of 8.79 s (SD ¬º .236). Fourteen of the twenty four clips were essentially Ô¨Åller material, containing non-emergency vehi- cles, or no road users at all for durations of 5, 10 and 15 s. Filler clips were included to improve ecological validity and increase the range of stimulus material. Furthermore clips featuring the police vehicle were in the minority, in order to simulate (to some extent) the lower frequency of emergency vehicles typically on UK roads, in comparison to non-emergency vehicles. The second presentation of emergency vehicle clips were reordered amongst the Ô¨Åller clips to counterbalance them within participants.  3.1.4.  Test room set-up & equipment  Stimulus materials were displayed on a High DeÔ¨Ånition screen (a 42 inch Panasonic TX-L42D25B), run on a laptop (a Toshiba Satellite with HDMI out controller set at 75 Hz, and screen reso- lution at 1968  1024) with the use of Gom Player and an external mouse capable of pausing the Ô¨Ålm clips. Participants were encouraged to sit at the same distance from the screen throughout the whole period stimulus materials were shown. The optimal distance from the screen was determined to be 81.5 cm. Daylight levels were controlled with blue and white Ô¨Ålters to prevent screen reÔ¨Çections and reduce the variance in ambient light levels.  3.1.5.  Procedure  Participants were tested individually at the Sussex Innovation Centre. Following brieÔ¨Ång and a test of eyesight, the procedure was demonstrated and participants practised on a Ô¨Åller clip featuring a non-emergency vehicle until they felt conÔ¨Ådent with the proce- dure. This typically took only one trial run. In the actual experi- ment, participants were shown the video clips which in combination with follow-up questions took approximately 20 min. Viewing time was capped at this duration to avoid the occurrence of the vigilance decrement (Nuechterlein et al., 1983). While watching each of the 24 clips, participants were asked to imagine they were waiting at a junction, looking to turn right. They were required to pause the clip upon identifying ‚Äòanother road user‚Äô (reaction time), and secondly at the ‚Äòlast possible moment they would feel comfortable pulling out in front of the road user to turn  Please cite this article in press as: Turner, S., et al., Determining optimum Ô¨Çash patterns for emergency service vehicles: An experimental investigation using high deÔ¨Ånition Ô¨Ålm, Applied Ergonomics (2013), http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2013.05.007

The experimenter noted the timer reading on the display when the clip was paused, and then resumed the clip so that the gap acceptance measure could be taken or the next clip shown. For each clip that contained a road user, participants were asked to rate the ‚Äòhazard posed by the situation‚Äô and the ‚Äòurgency of the vehicle‚Äô on a scale of one to Ô¨Åve, after the clip had Ô¨Ånished. The four EVL conditions were then repeated at the end of the procedure one to four times (depending on participant preference) enabling participants to rank them in terms of perceived urgency.  3.2.  Results  The repetition of stimulus material enabled two measures of gap acceptance, reaction time, hazard and urgency perception to be taken in response to each of the Ô¨Åve experimental conditions (the four EVL conditions and the No Lights Condition). An average of each pair of observations was calculated and analyses (t-tests and 2  2 repeated measures ANOVAS) were conducted on this data. For brevity, data is not presented on participant responses to Ô¨Åller clips; measures were collected in the same way for all clips to reduce demand characteristics as far as possible. However no participants identiÔ¨Åed a hazard in the clips which did not feature any vehicle, therefore the false alarm count for hazard spotting was zero.  3.2.1.  Effects of  light combination over the no light condition  Interval data (or ordinal data which could be treated as interval) was Ô¨Årst subjected to a repeated measures ANOVA. Post-hoc tests with a Bonferroni correction (to control for type I error) enabled the identiÔ¨Åcation of whether any light combination produced superior performance on these measures in comparison to the No Light (NL) light condition (F (4, 52) ¬º 11.64, p < .001), however post hoc tests Condition. Gap acceptance scores differed signiÔ¨Åcantly according to condition (M ¬º 2.95s, indicate that gap acceptance in the NL SD ¬º .758) did not differ signiÔ¨Åcantly in comparison to the 1 Hz single pulse (SP), condition (M ¬º 2.58s, SD ¬º .640). All other light combi- nations produced a signiÔ¨Åcant improvement to the NL condition in terms of gap acceptance (see Table 1). Furthermore a repeated measures ANOVA with a Greenhouse-Geisser correction determined that both hazard perception and urgency perception signiÔ¨Åcantly differed across light condition (F (2.326, 83.735) ¬º 19.89, p < .001; F (3.003, 108.123) ¬º 46.87, p < .001, respectively). Post hoc tests revealed that every EVL condition produced a signiÔ¨Åcant improve- ment in hazard and urgency perception beyond the police vehicle displaying no emergency lights at all (see Table 1). In contrast, a repeated measures ANOVA (with Greenhouse-Geisser) conducted on the reaction time data conÔ¨Årmed that there was no systematic variation in time to detect the police vehicle due to light condition (F (2.820, 101.514) ¬º 2.21, p ¬º .096).  Table 1 Means and standard deviations of gap acceptance and reaction times (secs), hazard and urgency perception scores for each emergency vehicle lighting condition (No Lights, 1 Hz SP, 4 Hz SP, 1 Hz TP, 4 Hz TP) * mean difference between EVL condition and NL condition is signiÔ¨Åcant at the .05 level, with a Bonferroni adjustment for multiple comparisons.

In the next sections, results comparing the effect of Ô¨Çash rate and pattern on gap acceptance, urgency perception and hazard perception are reported.  3.2.2. Gap acceptance & urgency perception  In the experimental scenarios, over 50% of the sample claimed that they would not pull out in front of the police car when it featured blue Ô¨Çashing lights. In contrast, 13 participants claimed they would pull out in front of the vehicle when its emergency lights were on display. An ANOVA was conducted on this data, which revealed that the main effect of Ô¨Çash rate on gap acceptance was signiÔ¨Åcant (F (1, 13) ¬º 4.765, p < .05), while Ô¨Çash pattern was not signiÔ¨Åcant (F (1, 13) ¬º .785, p ¬º .392). However the interaction effect between Ô¨Çash rate and pattern was signiÔ¨Åcant (F (1, 13) ¬º 5.696, p < .05). Essen- tially clips showing a faster Ô¨Çash rate were paused more quickly, giving the participant more time to pull out in front of the police vehicle (indicative of less risky hypothetical driving behaviour) than those showing a slower Ô¨Çash rate, although this only held for pattern (M ¬º 2.08s, SD ¬º .663; M ¬º 2.58s, the single pulse SD ¬º .640). This differentiation between fast and slow Ô¨Çash rates was reduced for the triple pulse patterns (M ¬º 2.29s, SD ¬º .813; M ¬º 2.22s, SD ¬º .548). In terms of urgency perception, an 2  2 ANOVA revealed the effect of Ô¨Çash rate on urgency ratings was signiÔ¨Åcant (F (1,36) ¬º 5.79, p < .05). Flash rates of 1 Hz (M ¬º 2.81, SD ¬º .787; M ¬º 2.90, SD ¬º .9) received a lower urgency rating than Ô¨Çash rates of 4 Hz (M ¬º 2.93, SD ¬º .897; M ¬º 3.09, SD ¬º .80). Again there was no direct 36) ¬º 2.18, p ¬º .148), and the interaction effect was also not sig- effect of Ô¨Çash pattern on urgency perception (F (1, niÔ¨Åcant (F (1, 36) ¬º .339, p ¬º .564). In this case therefore the Ô¨Çash pattern did not alter the effect of Ô¨Çash rate on urgency ratings.  3.2.3. Hazard perception  The mean average hazard perception ratings for the stimulus vehicle displaying the four light combinations were very similar (considering they were measured on a scale of 1e5), ranging from 2.02 (SD ¬º .787) to 2.11 (SD ¬º .818). Although t-tests indicated that all of these conditions are perceived to be more hazardous than the No Lights Condition (see Table 1), an ANOVA indicated there were no signiÔ¨Åcant differences between hazard ratings amongst the conditions, however the effect of rate approached signiÔ¨Åcance (F (1,36) ¬º 3.56, p ¬º .067).  3.2.4. Urgency ranking  27% of participants (n ¬º 10) rated the 4 Hz triple pulse combi- nation as most urgent, or one of two combinations that were most urgent out of all the light combinations. The 1 Hz single pulse combination received the lowest amount of ‚Äòmost urgent‚Äô ratings, at 8.1% of the sample (n ¬º 3). The most reliable Ô¨Ånding was that over half of the sample perceived the 1 Hz single pulse combination as the least urgent (51.3%), indeed the median rank for this combi- nation was 3.5 (ranks ranged from 1 to 4), whereas it was 2.5 for every other combination. A Friedman test was conducted to test the statistical signiÔ¨Åcance of these Ô¨Åndings, which conÔ¨Årmed that the urgency rankings of the four light conditions signiÔ¨Åcantly differed (c2 [3] ¬º 24.618, p < .01). A Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test conducted on each pair indicates these differences are only amongst the 1 Hz SP combination in comparison with every other condition: 4 Hz TP (z ¬º  3.399, p ¬º .001), 4 Hz SP (z ¬º  3.181, p ¬º .001], 1 Hz TP (z ¬º  3.878, p < .001). These results therefore indicate that the only reliable difference in urgency amongst the light combinations was  Please cite this article in press as: Turner, S., et al., Determining optimum Ô¨Çash patterns for emergency service vehicles: An experimental investigation using high deÔ¨Ånition Ô¨Ålm, Applied Ergonomics (2013), http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2013.05.007  
6  S. Turner et al.  / Applied Ergonomics xxx (2013) 1e7  that the 1 Hz single pulse combination was considered to depict the least urgency out of the four combinations.  4. Discussion  Results indicate that participants would give a police vehicle more space when pulling out across its path if it has a faster rather than slower Ô¨Çash rate when it has a single pulse pattern. This could be because participants perceive the vehicle to be travelling with a greater degree of urgency when it has a faster Ô¨Çash rate, as sup- ported by the Ô¨Ånding that Ô¨Çash rates of 1 Hz receive a lower ur- gency rating than Ô¨Çash rates of 4 Hz. However the triple pulse pattern effectively reduced the effectiveness (as measured by gap acceptance) of the 4 Hz rate and improved the effectiveness of the 1 Hz rate. This Ô¨Ånding is supported by participants‚Äô comments: some felt a rhythmic Ô¨Çash pattern resulted in a clearer warning, and the 4 Hz triple pulse pattern (effectively 12 Hz) appeared the least rhythmic of all the light combinations. However this interaction effect was not observed with urgency perception. The 4 Hz single pulse combination evoked the smallest gap acceptance times, indicating it was the optimal Ô¨Çash pattern as measured by this factor. These results are consistent with research which has found urgency perception is higher for higher Ô¨Çash rates (Cook et al., 1999). Unfortunately the authors of this report are unaware of any other research that has investigated how gap acceptance is affected by Ô¨Çash pattern and rate; therefore these Ô¨Åndings can not be compared against those from prior studies. This study found no differentiation in perceived hazard ac- cording to light combination. Other research has however found that hazard perception increases with increasing Ô¨Çash rates, and for triple rather than single pulse patterns (Chan and Ng, 2009). This may be because in the current hypothetical scenario, participants perceived the scenario to present little risk because they were stationary at a junction, on a different road to the approaching vehicle. Therefore there was not a great deal of variation in hazard ratings. In contrast, characteristics of the test vehicle appeared to be judged more effectively with the urgency ratings. However when participants were asked to rank the urgency of the vehicles in the EVL clips, the majority felt there was little difference between them, apart from the 1 Hz single pulse combination being perceived as the least urgent. It would seem that a conscious appreciation of the urgency suggested by the light combinations was lacking in this sample. In support of this assertion, 67.6% of the sample claimed that they did not notice that the clips featuring the police car had different light patterns (i.e. they differed in terms of Ô¨Çash pattern and rate) until they had the opportunity to watch the clips back-to- back during the urgency ranking scenario. This study did not Ô¨Ånd any effect of EVL on reaction times. Re- action times to the police vehicle with any combination of EVL at all did not differ in comparison to when the vehicle had no lights on display. In contrast other research has found that Ô¨Çashing lights are detected more quickly when they employ a faster Ô¨Çash rate (Cook et al., 1999; Wells, 2004), and when they feature a double rather than single pulse pattern (Cook et al.). The discrepancy between the results of this research and similar studies may be due to meth- odological issues (see next section).  4.1.  Limitations and suggestions for further research  In terms of technical limitations involved in the development of materials, there are two key limitations. The materials were subject to rolling shutter effect (in which the camera records different parts of the frame at different times). Although this effect was barely perceptible during the trials, it will have made slight alterations to the Ô¨Çash patterns and rates that were viewed by participants. In  addition the materials that were shown to participants were compressed and therefore of a lower resolution than the original material. It should be noted that compression artefacts were not speciÔ¨Åcally identiÔ¨Åed in the materials, although subtle effects may have been present. More general limitations of the materials may have suppressed effects observed on the gap acceptance and reaction time measures. The vehicle was always present at the beginning of the clip in a very similar location because of the road curvature and the need to present the vehicle ‚Äòhead on‚Äô. This is likely to have reduced varia- tion in reaction times through the role of expectation. Ideally a longer approach with an incline would be employed for future research. This would ensure that the vehicle only emerges in the distance from the peak of a hill, which would also allow the time before the vehicle appears to be varied in order to reduce the role of expectation in responses. Furthermore different locations and di- rections of movement could also be used for displaying the stim- ulus vehicle for future research, which would also reduce the predictability of the material should resources allow. The gap acceptance measure could be more discriminating if the stimulus vehicles were viewed with a longer approach. The stimulus vehicles had an approximate approach distance of 100 m in this study, which for many participants was not enough space to pull out across the path of a police vehicle displaying emergency lights. Finally although this research found some evidence to suggest that a faster Ô¨Çash rate on a police vehicle is likely to produce a greater perception of urgency and more wariness about pulling out in front of its path than a slower Ô¨Çash rate (primarily with a single rather than triple pulse pattern), it is uncertain whether this would translate into driving behaviour. Observational studies in the Ô¨Åeld are lacking, making it difÔ¨Åcult to ascertain whether drivers have sufÔ¨Åcient opportunity to avoid emergency service vehicles on typically congested roads. Additionally drivers may not view the EVL of approaching vehicles for long enough to discern the level of urgency from Ô¨Çash characteristics. Previous research investigating search times at the same junction at which stimulus materials were Ô¨Ålmed, found that drivers search for hazards for less than .5 s (Langham and Labbett, 2006). If search times remain at .5 s when an emergency vehicle is present, EVL which features a Ô¨Çash rate below 2 Hz may go completely undetected and drivers may not perceive the vehicle to be travelling in emergency mode.  4.2.  Conclusions  Emergency vehicle lighting is a critical means by which drivers are alerted to the presence of emergency service vehicles. This research has found evidence to suggest for urgent situations, a 4 Hz Ô¨Çash rate should be utilised over a 1 Hz Ô¨Çash rate to enhance per- ceptions of urgency. Furthermore if a 4 Hz single Ô¨Çash combination is employed, this research suggests it will produce safer trafÔ¨Åc- merging manoeuvres from stationary drivers at junctions, than any other EVL combination tested. The Ô¨Åndings are applicable only to the development of a high urgency mode, rather than a low urgency mode Ô¨Çash combination. This is because it is uncertain whether reaction times amongst EVL conditions truly did not differ or whether this was due to meth- odological issues. Therefore it can not be certain whether a low urgency EVL mode would effectively reduce the conspicuity of an emergency vehicle; further research is required in this respect. It is concluded that this research has made considerable progress in uncovering some of the light characteristics that would be optimal for emergency service vehicles in a situation of high urgency. However its main contribution is in trialling a methodology which is not resource-intensive, and maintains a balance between ecological validity and experimental control.

s000368701300118x,"  Understanding safety information concerns, products, and equipment is important for their proper use (Wogalter, 2006). Communicating safety information has become increasingly chal- lenging as people speaking different languages intermix through travel and trade. Illiteracy can increase this challenge. To overcome these and related difÔ¨Åculties, symbols offer a potential way to address the language barrier as a sort of ‚Äúuniversal‚Äù language. However, a common Ô¨Ånding in research on symbol comprehension is that the intended communication may not be understood properly (e.g., Hancock et al., 1999). Worse yet, some symbols in certain contexts can confuse the viewer by conveying the wrong information (e.g., Zwaga and Boersema, 1983). Nevertheless effec- tive symbols seem to offer beneÔ¨Åts. In addition, symbols appear to be useful in attracting attention, which is important to processing safety communications (Bzostek and Wogalter, 1999; Laughery et al., 1993). Because of difÔ¨Åculties in understanding symbols, domestic and international standards organizations have produced methods and criteria to assess comprehension adequacy of symbols. The Amer- ican National Standard Institute‚Äôs (ANSI) Criteria for Safety Symbols requires 85 percent correct in a comprehension test with a sample of 50 people reporting the intended concept. Criteria include that no more than Ô¨Åve percent of the sample may experience critical  * Corresponding author. Tel.: √æ1 919 306 2964; fax: √æ1 919 515 1716. E-mail address: brmcdoug@ncsu.edu (B.R.

The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) also has a set of guidelines for symbol comprehension (ISO 9186, 2007). ISO and ANSI are in the process of harmonizing their symbol guidelines. Designing symbols that meet ANSI criteria is reportedly difÔ¨Åcult (e.g., Davies et al., 1998; Hancock et al., 2004; Zwaga and Boersema, 1983). To aid designers in creating symbols that meet these criteria, the human factors literature offers strategies and methods to in- crease comprehension (e.g., Collins and Lerner, 1982; Easterby and Hakiel, 1981; Hancock et al., 2004; Wogalter et al., 2006). For example, one strategy to inÔ¨Çuence symbol comprehension is to enhance legibility d the visual clarity of a symbol (Wogalter et al., 2002). Traditionally, symbol simplicity is preferred to enhance legibility (Wogalter et al., 2006) resulting in the use of bold lines in lieu of Ô¨Åne lines or details. Some guidelines (e.g., FMC, 1985; Westinghouse Electric Corporation, 1981) and standards (e.g., ANSI Z535.3, 2011; ISO 3864-1, 2003) suggest the use of simple symbols for warnings. However, these suggestions may be inappropriate in situations necessitating speciÔ¨Åc and complex communication of information. When symbols lose increasingly more information due to simpli- Ô¨Åcation, the symbol may lack the necessary information for in- dividuals to interpret its intended meaning. Fig. 1 provides an example of a symbol that appears to lack enough information to attain a high level of comprehension. So sometimes introducing increased information or detail may beneÔ¨Åt symbols, which is contrary to conventional design strategies emphasizing minimal detail. Detail may be necessary for some symbols to meet high levels of comprehension. The additional information may aid the  0003-6870/$ e see front matter √ì 2013 Elsevier Ltd and The Ergonomics Society.

Two experiments described in this report examine whether color highlighting can improve pictorial comprehension performance. Two highlighting conditions are examined: relevant and irrelevant. In the relevant highlighting condition, a portion highly pertinent or relevant to the intended meaning of the pictorial is overlaid with the color yellow. It was expected that highlighting would enhance pictorial comprehension compared to the same pictorials with no highlighting. This enhancement could be explained by the high- lighting focusing viewers‚Äô attention to pertinent aspects of the pictorial compared to the absence of relevant highlighting. In the irrelevant condition, a portion minimally pertinent or relevant to the intended meaning of the pictorial is overlaid with the color yellow. It was expected that this highlighting would diminish pictorial comprehension compared to the same pictorials with no highlighting. This diminishment in performance could be explained by the highlighting focusing viewer‚Äôs attention away from pertinent aspects of the pictorial compared to the absence of irrelevant highlighting. Irrelevant highlighting may misguide viewers‚Äô atten- tion resulting in lower comprehension. The second experiment differed from the Ô¨Årst by sampling from a different population and addressing methodological issues.  2.  Experiment 1  Pictorial comprehension is investigated comparing relevant and irrelevant highlighting to no highlighting.  2.1. Method  2.1.1.  Participants  Eighty-four North Carolina State University undergraduate stu- dents (mean age ¬º 18.7 years, SD ¬º 1.2) participated as part of a course requirement for an introductory psychology course. The sample was comprised of 35 males and 49 females.  2.1.2.  Experimental design and stimuli  Participants completed an online questionnaire with 13 picto- rials. Each pictorial was accompanied with a short statement brieÔ¨Çy describing the context where it might be located. Three of the pictorials were specious and intended to help disguise the purpose of the study. Responses to the specious pictorials were not analyzed. The other 10 pictorials were experimentally manipulated to form three conditions. The three experimental conditions were no highlighting, less relevant (or irrelevant) highlighting and rele- vant highlighting. To form these conditions, a set of ‚Äúbase‚Äù picto- rials was Ô¨Årst produced. All of these had no highlighting and served as stimuli in the no highlighting condition. From the base non- highlighted pictorials the other two experimental conditions were produced. To form the relevant highlighting set of pictorials yellow was added that encircled and covered the most pertinent portion(s) of the pictorial in order to determine its meaning. This area was generally the focal point of the interaction between the human Ô¨Ågure and the instructed action. The less relevant (irrelevant) highlighting added color to the base pictorials that did not cover the focal point of the interaction between the human Ô¨Ågure and the instructed action. This area included any distinct object within the pictorial that did not overlap with the relevant highlighting portion. For examples, see Figs. 3 and 4 shown later in this article. High- lighting was always accomplished using a highly saturated yellow hue. (Note: the pictorials shown in the Ô¨Ågures as illustrative ex- amples use gray highlighting in lieu of yellow.) The speciÔ¨Åc conceptual meanings (referents) of the ten manip- ulated pictorials were: (1) hold on with your hand to ladder while  Fig. 1.

Fig. 1 would likely be beneÔ¨Åtted by at least some additional information within the symbol, such as more speciÔ¨Åcs about the dam and surrounding environment or a different perspective of the structure. One of the main reasons that guidelines on warnings mandate limited detail is that lesser important information (e.g., detail) may capture and hold attention to the detriment of attention to relevant details and the determination of the symbol‚Äôs intended meaning (Wogalter et al., 2006). Symbols designed with minimal complexity are differentiated from pictorials, which are symbols designed with greater amounts of detail and information. Pictorials might beneÔ¨Åt from prominent aspects or characteristics that direct the viewer‚Äôs attention to the most relevant information. Salience is a stimulus-driven or bottomeup process whereby physical characteristics tend to ‚Äúpop-out‚Äù from the context and seemingly to stand out effortlessly (Fecteau and Munoz, 2006; Yantis, 2000). The addition of color is one method to increase salience (e.g., Itti et al., 1998; Peters et al., 2005). Colored back- grounds are commonly used in warning pictorials to attract viewer‚Äôs attention from environmental stimuli to the warning (ISO 3864-1, 2003). Highlighting a limited area of the pictorial with color could be used to increase the salience of the most relevant details of the pictorial. Focusing attention through highlighting could reduce the potential adverse effects of introducing greater pictorial complexity. The use of highlighting to direct viewer‚Äôs attention has been demonstrated in previous research in other areas. For example, Wickens et al. (2004) investigated the utility of varying intensity of highlighting in the performance of map reading tasks by increasing the salience and discriminability of stimuli. Martin et al. (1987) found that highlighting can increase performance of visual search with minimal performance cost to ignoring incorrectly highlighted stimuli. Wu and Yuan (2003) demonstrated the superiority in reading times of traditional, color highlighting in comparison to no highlighting, and other, non-traditional forms of highlighting (e.g., Ô¨Çashing text). In a review of color coding research, Christ (1975) concluded that color facilitates identiÔ¨Åcation and searching of ob- jects, particularly when the color is known to be uniquely associ- ated with the target. Potential harmful effects of highlighting have also been observed (e.g., Fisher and Tan, 1989; Tamborelloii and Byrne, 2007). In visual search tasks, when highlighting is placed over the target stimuli, search time decreases. However, when highlighting is placed over a distracter, search time increases. Whether high- lighting is placed over the target or a distracter, it is drawing the viewer‚Äôs attention toward that area. Additionally, inappropriate highlighting has been shown to interfere with text comprehension when placed on less relevant or irrelevant information (e.g., Gier et al., 2009). The harmful effects of color were also identiÔ¨Åed by Christ‚Äôs (1975) review. For example, when color is added to  Please cite this article in press as: McDougald, B.R., Wogalter, M.S., Facilitating pictorial comprehension with color highlighting, Applied Ergonomics (2013), http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2013.05.008

Thus from the 10 base picto- rials, 30 experimental pictorials were produced. Each base pictorial had a representative in each of the three highlighting conditions. The study was a within-subjects design. In an attempt to control for pictorial speciÔ¨Åc effects, all base pictorials were presented in each of the highlighting conditions across three different versions of the task. Each base pictorial was presented only once in each of the versions. Each version included pictorials in all three high- lighting conditions. See Fig. 2 for a graphical representation of how pictorials were presented to participants. Because there were 10 pictorials presented in three conditions, there was an unequal distribution of pictorials in each condition. Each participant saw three pictorials in two conditions and four pictorials in the other  Fig. 3. Pictorial referent is ‚Äúhold on to side and hold child‚Äôs hand while on moving walkway‚Äù.

Procedure  Participants signed up to take part in the study via a web link that navigated them to an online questionnaire. At that point par- ticipants were assigned to one of three versions of the pictorials using block random assignment. All participants saw a sequence of 13 pictorials. Ten were experimentally manipulated pictorials in each of the three highlighting conditions. Three were specious pictorials intended to be Ô¨Ållers that were not manipulated or scored. Participants read a short statement describing context in which the pictorial might be viewed and viewed the pictorial. Participants were asked to type into a dialog box adjacent to the pictorial on what they believed the pictorial was attempting to communicate. Participants were encouraged to give as detailed and speciÔ¨Åc descriptions that they could. After completing each response, they continued to the next pictorial until they completed the entire set. Upon completing their responses to the pictorials, participants completed a short demographic questionnaire. Two independent raters evaluated participants‚Äô responses. Raters compared the conceptual meanings to participants‚Äô re- sponses to determine correctness: correct (assigned a score of 1) or incorrect (assigned a score of 0). Responses needed to reasonably reÔ¨Çect the intended meaning of the referent. It did not have to match a verbatim description. For example, the pictorial with the meaning ‚Äúhold on with your hand to a ladder while keeping both feet on it‚Äù could be correctly answered by a number of conceptually similar responses such as ‚Äúmaintain three points of contact with the ladder at all times.‚Äù General responses such as ‚Äúuse ladder prop- erly‚Äù were not counted as correct responses.

4  2.2.  Results  B.R. McDougald, M.S. Wogalter / Applied Ergonomics xxx (2013) 1e6  For each participant, the number of correct interpretations of pictorials was calculated for each of the three conditions. Between the two independent raters, inter-rater reliability was 0.92, and Cohen‚Äôs Kappa, a measure of nominal scale response agreement between two raters by taking into account chance agreement be- tween raters (Cohen, 1960) was 0.84. Descriptive statistics for number of correct responses per participant are shown in Table 1 under ‚Äúfrequency‚Äù. The total number of correct responses in rela- tion to the total number of possible responses is provided under ‚Äúproportion‚Äù in Table 1. An ANOVA on the proportion data indicated the use of highlighting (no highlighting, less relevant highlighting, relevant highlighting) showed a signiÔ¨Åcant effect of the conditions, F(1.73, 142.17) ¬º 68.29, MSE ¬º 0.92, p < 0.001, hp 2 ¬º 0.45. Compar- isons among means using the Bonferroni correction showed that comprehension was higher for relevant highlighting than no highlighting or less relevant highlighting. Also, comprehension was lower for less relevant highlighting than for no highlighting (all ps < 0.02).  2.3. Discussion  The data show that relevant color highlighting assisted comprehension of the pictorials compared to no highlighting. Higher pictorial comprehension for relevant highlighting is prob- ably due to viewers‚Äô focusing visual attention on the most relevant information. Additionally, less relevant or irrelevant highlighting reduced comprehension of the pictorials probably because this highlighted information captured visual focus on the wrong infor- mation leading to confusion. If relevant portions of the pictorial are highlighted then there are comprehension beneÔ¨Åts. However, if the highlighted area is less or not relevant, then it may focus attention away from pertinent information and lead interpretation astray. Thus, highlighting appears to be either beneÔ¨Åcial or detrimental depending on the relevance of the areas highlighted to its intended meaning. There were two methodological difÔ¨Åculties; neither difÔ¨Åculty was major but worth pointing out. The Ô¨Årst concerned the number of pictorials manipulated experimentally. There was an imbalance in the number of pictorials in each condition each participant viewed (e.g., three in two conditions and four in one condition). The unequal number of pictorials in each condition required that a more complex experimental design be used in which extra care was necessary to have all three variations of the pictorials (relevant, irrelevant, and no highlighting) to be seen by an equal number of participants by rotating the imbalanced sets across conditions and participant groups. Second, the participants were all undergraduate students. Although they were young adults majoring in a broad range of subjects, they are a narrow demographic compared to the broader population expected to interpret pictorials. A second experiment was conducted to address these concerns.  3.  Experiment 2  Experiment 2 replicates Experiment 1 with three exceptions. One is that in Experiment 2 every participant viewed the same number of pictorials in each highlighting condition. This improve- ment was aimed to address the imbalance mentioned above in Experiment 1. Experiment 2‚Äôs experimental design was simpliÔ¨Åed compared to Experiment 1 by increasing the number of pictorials so there were an equal number of pictorials in each of the three con- ditions. Second, some of the pictorials were redrawn or modiÔ¨Åed slightly based on comments from a group of persons with a human factors/ergonomics background asked to give feedback. Third,  Experiment 2 included a more diverse group of sampled partici- pants than the undergraduate participants from Experiment 1.  3.1. Method  3.1.1.  Participants  A total of 207 persons (71 males and 136 females) participated. Participants‚Äô reported ages ranged from 18 to 81 with a mean of 34.1 years (SD ¬º 12.0). Participants represented a variety of occu- pations and a broad range of education levels from earning a high school or equivalent degree to completing graduate or professional school. Participants were recruited through Mechanical Turk (MTurk; Amazon.com, 2010). MTurk is an online marketplace that utilizes crowdsourcing to accomplish tasks by participants repre- senting a wider population sample than undergraduate students (e.g., Paolacci et al., 2010). Behrend et al. (2011) found MTurk par- ticipants to be older, more ethnically diverse, and to possess more experience working than undergraduate students. All participants were reportedly U.S. residents and compensated at a level slightly above the median MTurk wage at $1.38 per hour (Horton and Chilton, 2010).  3.1.2.  Experimental design and stimuli  The set of ten pictorials from Experiment 1 served as the starting point for the development of the pictorials in Experiment 2. Two additional pictorials were created to balance the number of picto- rials per condition. Six Human Factors subject matter experts (SMEs) were provided with printouts of the pictorials from Experiment 1 along with the two additional pictorials accompanied by a short description of where the warning could be posted. The SMEs gave feedback pertaining to design recommendations for the purpose of maximizing comprehension by viewers. After initial feedback was collected, it was followed by a short discussion of each pictorial to clarify its intended meaning and any additional suggestions were solicited. Revisions to three of the pictorials were made based on this feedback. This process resulted in 12 ‚Äúbase‚Äù pictorials each pertaining to a unique intended meaning that functioned in the ‚Äúno highlighting‚Äù condition. The referents of the 12 manipulated base pictorials were: (1) hold on with your hand while keeping both feet on the ladder, (2) use safety clamps on barbell when lifting weights, (3) do not support ladder from underneath, (4) look both ways before crossing, (5) keep out of reach of children, (6) hold on while standing on bus, (7) do not use weights on exercise ball, (8) turn handles inward, not outward on a stove, (9) do not overload outlets/ plug in too many electric devices, (10) hold rail and child‚Äôs hand while on moving walkway, (11) bend at the knees, and (12) secure the spreaders on ladder. See Figs. 3 and 4 for examples of pictorials in the three conditions. From the pictorials without highlighting, the other two experi- mental conditions were produced. The principles used to highlight the relevant areas and less relevant or irrelevant areas of the pic- torials were the same as those described in the Method section of Experiment 1. A total of 36 pictorial-condition combinations were created. According to a 3  3 Latin Square, the three sets of picto- rials were combined with three groups of participants. Each set of pictorials contained one of each of the 12 base pictorials. The sets differed in which pictorials were in which highlighting condition. Each of the three sets included 12 unique pictorial-condition combinations and four pictorials for each condition. Thus, each group of participants viewed 12 pictorials with four pictorials in each of the three highlighting conditions. Participants were randomly assigned to three groups that saw different sets of pic- torials in the highlighting condition. No participant saw the same pictorial in more than one condition, and all pictorials appeared an  Please cite this article in press as: McDougald, B.R., Wogalter, M.S., Facilitating pictorial comprehension with color highlighting, Applied Ergonomics (2013), http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2013.05.008

Results  Inter-rater reliability was 0.90, and Cohen‚Äôs Kappa (Cohen, 1960) was 0.79. Descriptive statistics for mean frequency of correct re- sponses per participant are shown in the middle column of Table 2. The proportion correct relative to the total number of responses is provided in the right-most column of the table. An ANOVA con- ducted on the proportions correct showed a signiÔ¨Åcant effect of the conditions, F(2, 412) ¬º 192.85, MSE ¬º 0.07, p < 0.001, hp 2 ¬º 0.48. Comparisons among means corrected for by the Bonferroni method showed that comprehension was higher for relevant highlighting than no highlighting or less relevant highlighting. Also, compre- hension was lower for less relevant highlighting than for no high- lighting (all ps < 0.02). An ANOVA and follow-up comparisons conducted on the frequency data instead of proportional data as described above produced similar results.  3.3. Discussion  The data support the notion that highlighting relevant portions of pictorials assisted viewers‚Äô comprehension. Salience of particu- larly important aspects in pictorials apparently serves to focus viewers‚Äô attention aiding in the comprehension of the intended meaning. The no highlighting condition, lacking focal attention cues, resulted in lower comprehension performance than relevant highlighting. Comprehension of pictorials was reduced when less relevant or irrelevant information was highlighted. Noteworthy is that performance in this condition was lower than the no high- lighting condition. Thus, irrelevant highlighting was harmful as shown by its negative effect on comprehension.  4. General discussion  Both experiments showed that highlighting relevant portions of pictorials can assist in their comprehension. Although simple symbols are generally desirable, sometimes greater detail is necessary to distinguish and elaborate content of a pictorial. However, additional detail may include a cost of decreased comprehension. Highlighting may direct or focus the viewer‚Äôs attention to the most relevant parts of the pictorials leading to better comprehension. Highlighting could, in effect, de-clutter or perceptually simplify the pictorial. Additionally, highlighting may enable the communication of small differences in conceptual meaning to be conveyed that distinguish between similar concepts. Adding relevant highlighting may do this by reducing scanning time associated with the examination of a detailed and complex graphic by helping to direct attention to relevant detail. Additionally, irrelevant highlighting was demonstrated in both experiments to be harmful to comprehension of intended mean- ings.

Developing a system wide understanding of users, the tools that they use and the environments in which the live and work supports this approach (Carayon et al., 2006). For medical devices, such as infusion pumps, there are several exam- ples of redesign that would reduce error rates (Lin et al., 1998; Thimbleby and Cairns, 2010). In these cases a valuable opportunity has been missed: once equipment has been deployed, it is difÔ¨Åcult to update or modify it. There have been calls for an acceleration of the integration of Human Factors and ergonomics in patient safety, including the creation of ‚Äúmarket forces for manufacturers to pro- duce safer products that incorporate HFE [Human Factors Engi- neering] principles and techniques‚Äù (Gurses et al., 2012). HFE is a term applied to the application of theory, principles, data and methods to design in order to optimise human well-being and overall system performance. The European equivalent is Usability Engineering (UE), which is similar in principle. The aim of the work reported here is to better understand current practices in incor- porating HFE into the design and development of interactive medical devices and, in particular, the challenges to doing so.  * Corresponding author.

A medical device manufacturer is required to be: ‚Äúreducing, as far as possible, the risk of use error due to the ergonomic features of the device and the environment in which the device is intended to be used.‚Äù They should provide: ‚Äúconsideration of the technical knowledge, experience, education and training and where applicable the medical and physical con- ditions of intended users‚Äù (EC, 1993). Modular, open, voluntary and harmonised standards support compliance with these requirements. One of these standards, IEC 62366 (2007) details the application of UE/HFE to medical de- vices. These interactions are broadly deÔ¨Åned and include (but are not limited to) transport, storage, installation, operation, mainte- nance, repair and disposal. There is a need to consult a broad range of specialists during the design and development process. Knowing which stakeholders to contact and when is often a thorny issue (Sharp et al., 1999). For example, communication can be within an organisation, between an organisation and suppliers, or out to regulators, users or research providers. Coordinating exchanges is not easy and barriers to communication can arise due to a lack of common understanding. For example, in many industries, people use tacit knowledge that is difÔ¨Åcult to express or share and rely upon shared cultural references that are only understood by people  0003-6870/$ e see front matter √ì 2013 Elsevier Ltd and The Ergonomics Society.

414  C.J. Vincent et al.  / Applied Ergonomics 45 (2014) 413e419  aware of the origins (Eckert et al., 2001, 2004; Eckert and Stacey, 2000; Eckert and Stacey, 2003; Flanagan et al., 2007). For medical devices, communication deÔ¨Åcits have been shown to result in the wrong device being developed or purchased. For example, in a study examining requirements elicitation for a medical imaging device, when the intended clinical population was surveyed, they expressed little need for the device (Hinrichs et al., 2010; Martin et al., 2012). Given the need for a broad range of specialists to work together, it can help to establish common ground. This is where mutual knowledge, beliefs and assumptions are identiÔ¨Åed (Clark et al., 1983). The concept of grounding can be likened to playing a duet on a piano, where players synchronise intros and exits, volume, tempo and dynamics. They also develop a mutual understanding of terminology, turn taking and limitations regarding the medium of communication. Recent studies examining the relationship between healthcare professionals and equipment providers have found several barriers to the formation of common ground. Money et al. (2011) found that UE/HFE practice is constrained by an over reliance on limited numbers of senior healthcare staff. They also found an avoidance of consultation with patients or less senior staff, and a tendency to make design modiÔ¨Åcations on the basis of intuition rather than the more formal approach of user testing. There were biases towards collecting measures of efÔ¨Åcacy to meet the needs of purchasing or evaluation agencies. The study also found a lack of clarity regarding who the user was and barriers relating to ethical process. For the later point, manufacturers raised concerns regarding the time it took to gain approvals. When involving patients, there were limi- tations in what could be achieved, when. For relationships internal to the design and development pro- cess, recent reports regarding the application of IEC 62366 to the development of ventilator systems call for a better deÔ¨Ånition of roles and responsibilities (van der Peijl et al., 2012). The authors suggest that UE/HFE should be deÔ¨Åned as a sub-process of the wider product development process and there should be greater linkages between UE/HFE and risk management. Associated research has Ô¨Çagged difÔ¨Åculties in translating user requirements to systems requirements, knowing when and where to invest devel- opment effort and managing the documentation burden (Fitch, 2004; Subita, 2007). There are accounts of difÔ¨Åculties in knowing when UE/HFE techniques should be applied, who is responsible for them, and integrating UE/HFE within existing development prac- tice (Gupta, 2007; Mehrfard et al., 2010; Samaras and Horst, 2005). Many of these issues are addressed in textbooks or guides (NPSA, 2010; Weinger et al., 2011; Wiklund et al., 2010), suggesting that although knowledge is available, practitioners may have difÔ¨Åculty in accessing, locating or assimilating it. We wanted to explore the challenges faced by those internal to the design and development process, when implementing UE/HFE. In a preceding qualitative analysis, reported elsewhere, we identi- Ô¨Åed a range of challenges relating to the application of UE/HFE. Analysis was based on a smaller number of datasets (11). Issues included effective collaborative working practices; understanding the user and their situation; providing adequate justiÔ¨Åcation for the adoption of a user-centred approach; the provision of clear guid- ance and support (Vincent and Blandford, 2011a); standardizing across the industry and understanding the regulatory intent (Vincent and Blandford, 2011b). In the preceding analysis, topics relating to communication and collaboration emerged repeatedly. We collected further data on that theme in order to conduct a focussed investigation, involving a greater number of participants and depth of analysis. The questions we focused on were, what are the challenges to communication and collaboration during UE/HFE activities, and  how can they be addressed? This could be in terms of making UE/ HFE guidance more accessible, or supporting integration between disciplines. In order to understand how best to do this, we continued to conduct a qualitative study based upon interviews with those involved in the design, development and deployment of medical equipment (generally infusion devices) (Vincent and Blandford, 2011a, 2011b). It involved eight additional sets of data, collected using a theoretical sample. We examined ways in which device developers were incorporating technical, environmental and social aspects into the device design. We used thematic anal- ysis to explore many of these issues, using the regulation, devel- opment, manufacture and deployment of infusion devices as foci. Although we did not set out to explore aspects regarding common ground, we found the concept useful in explaining the behaviours that were described.  3. "
s000368701300121x,"  This article presents a comparative analysis of easy-to-use methods for assessing musculoskeletal load and the risk for developing musculoskeletal disorders. In all such methods, assessment of load consists in deÔ¨Åning input data, the procedure and the system of assessment. This article shows what assessment steps the methods have in common; it also shows how those methods differ in each step. In addition, the methods are grouped according to their characteristic features. The conclusion is that the concepts of assessing risk in different methods can be used to develop solutions leading to a comprehensive method appropriate for all work tasks and all parts of the body. However, studies are necessary to verify the accepted premises and to introduce some standardization that would make consolidation possible. √ì 2013 Elsevier Ltd and The Ergonomics Society.

Musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) are among the most serious consequences of improper work-related musculoskeletal load (Hoogendoorn et al., 2002; Van Niewenhuyse et al., 2006; Joksimovic et al., 2002; Bosch et al., 2007; van der Windt et al., 2000). Symptoms of MSDs are deÔ¨Åned as pain in one or more re- gions of the body. Accumulated minor injuries that result from repeated long-term work-related load can be considered the main cause of MSDs (NRC, 2001). Research conÔ¨Årms a relationship between musculoskeletal load expressed as a function of parameters that describe posture, force and time sequences, and the incidence of MSDs (Van Nieuwenhuyse et al., 2006). This means that a suitable work load can reduce the risk factors   posture and exerted of developing MSDs.

That is why it is so important to correctly assess that load on the basis of biomechanical factors and the methods this can be done with. "
s0003687013001221,"  Since the introduction of commercial computing in organiza- tions in the 1950s, information and telecommunication technol- ogy (here abbreviated to IT) has been related to organizational change. This has attracted a large number of researchers contributing to a wealth of studies that investigate the relation- ship between IT and organizational change using a variety of research methods. This paper acknowledges Ken D. Eason as one of the signiÔ¨Åcant contributors of the socio-technical research tradition and illus- trates the value of socio-technical analysis applied at an organi- zational level. More speciÔ¨Åcally, by adopting a socio-technical perspective such as the one he represents, we attempt to explain how the development and use of IT in organizations over time has contributed to producing signiÔ¨Åcant changes to the way organi- zations are structuring themselves and sourcing products, ser- vices, resources as well as business processes. Based on our analysis, we argue that we have not reached a saturation point regarding IT development, nor are we likely to reach this stage in the next few decades. On the contrary, we are likely to see an accelerated development of IT, which we believe will lead to a  * Corresponding author. Tel.: √æ1 418 656 2131x6087. nba.itm@cbs.dk (N.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. The next section provides a brief historical overview of socio-technical information system (IS) research. In the third section, we perform a non- exhaustive review of studies investigating the impact of IT on or- ganizations in the last four decades, identifying the dominant research theme in each decade. In the fourth section, we explain how the development of IT over time has contributed to a decrease in transaction costs, making it easier for organizations to increas- ingly source from the market rather than to produce internally. In the Ô¨Åfth section, we present a number of third party platforms facilitating sourcing before presenting a framework consisting of Ô¨Åve different types of sourcing arrangements in section six. The seventh section discusses the future development of IT and how it can lead to the type of organization we have chosen to call the ‚ÄòAmbient Organization‚Äô. The paper ends with conclusions and projections for the Ambient Organization.  2.  The origins of socio-technical IS research  The socio-technical research tradition is traditionally attributed to the Tavistock School founded in 1964 with researchers such as Fred Emery and Eric Trist (Emery, 1969; Emery and Trist, 1965). Another important locus for socio-technical research at that time was the Work Research Institute (WRI) founded in 1964 in Oslo,  0003-6870/$ e see front matter √ì 2013 Elsevier Ltd and The Ergonomics Society.

Using the general principles of socio-technical research, researchers were Ô¨Årst interested in studying the rela- tionship between production technology and organizational structure (Woodward, 1981). Later, a number of socio-technical researchers identiÔ¨Åed the enormous potential of electronic data processing (EDP), later referred to as information technology (IT), and attempted to apply socio-technical approaches to study this technology. Among the pioneers in this new research Ô¨Åeld were Ida Hoos in California (Hoos, 1961), Enid Mumford in UK (Mumford and Banks, 1967), and a young cognitive ergonomist named Ken D. Eason (Eason et al., 1975). He joined the social-technical research tradition by forming, along with other researchers such as Leela Damodaran and Tom Stewart, the small, but very effective, HUSAT research group at Loughborough University. For an overview, see also Bansler (1989), Bj√∏rn-Andersen et al. (1979), Briefs et al. (1985), Kling (1980) and Mowshowitz (1980).  3. Review of IT impact on organizations and individuals  Since the implementation of commercial computing in the 1950s, the impact of IT on organizational structure has attracted a large number of researchers using various research methodologies to study the impact of IT artifacts on multiple aspects of organiza- tions and individuals. This area has also been identiÔ¨Åed early as one of the core topics in information systems research (Culnan, 1987), and this stream of research is still actively pursued by numerous scholars. The methodology applied for re-constructing the historical overview, to a very large extent, was one of an exploratory tracer approach, where every publication that typically had a number of references, was pursued. Contrary to literature surveys for the last two decades, most of the material from the early days was not electronically available; conferences and working papers provided further information. Based on this analysis, we shall argue that the dominating research focus has changed over the last Ô¨Åve decades in a way that each new decade can be said to introduce a new research stream. This does not mean that the old ones disappeared, as most of them continued, but each decade was dominated by a particular research design, which we identify as:   1960s and 1970s: IT impact on organizations and individuals  1980s: IT impact on organizational design  1990s: IT impact on inter-organizational design  2000s: IT impact on organizational re-invention  In this way, as we shall argue later, IT moves from being seen predominantly as an exogenous, deterministic inÔ¨Çuence to a powerful tool, useful in socio-technical design of new organiza- tional forms, gravitating towards what we have chosen to call Ambient organizations.  3.1. 1960s and 1970s: structures  IT impact on individuals and organizational  The introduction of commercial computing in organizations started in the 1950s, and from the very beginning, the potential of IT to produce changes in the role of individuals and on organizational structures attracted the attention of several researchers. For example, one of the earliest studies of IT impact applied longitudinal Ô¨Åeldwork to examine organizational changes associated with the implementation of mainframe computing in the 1950s (Mann and Williams, 1960). One area of particular interest was the impact of IT on organizational structures. For example, researchers speculated  on the impact of IT on organizational structures by hypothesizing that organizations would become hourglass shaped because the need for middle managers would diminish (Whisler, 1970). However, the prime focus at that time was the impact of IT on workers. Researchers were speculating about the impact of com- puters (e.g., Hoos, 1960), and there were empirical investigations of the impact of IT on insurance clerks (Hoos, 1961), its inÔ¨Çuence on job content and job satisfaction of workers (Bj√∏rn-Andersen et al., 1979; Mumford and Banks, 1967), its impact on middle managers (Robey, 1977; Stewart, 1972), and the nature and extent to which IT would create new work roles (Den Hertog et al., 1980). Investigating the impact of IT, and especially a more specialized area called humanecomputer interaction (HCI) (Waterson and Eason, 2009), was also center stage for Ken D. Eason in the late 1970s. For example, he found that while more advanced systems are likely to be more Ô¨Çexible and useful to managers, their higher complexity can also be an obstacle to their effective and full use (Eason, 1974). Another Ô¨Ånding was the common mismatch between the sophistication of a user‚Äôs task-related information needs and its ability and willingness to make the required effort to learn how to use the computer to perform the task (Eason, 1976). As such, the biggest challenge of computer designers is to Ô¨Ånd ways of serving the needs of infrequent users with open-ended tasks without assuming those tasks to exhibit more closed characteristics than is in fact the case (Eason, 1980). To allow organizational needs to deÔ¨Åne the design of IT, a higher involvement of users is needed in the IT design and implementation processes as well as a move from a one shot technology-led implementation towards a more evolu- tionary way of implementing IT (Eason, 1982). The Ô¨Årst author of this paper had the pleasure of collaborating with Ken D. Eason on a project that was published nine years later as ‚ÄòManaging computer impact‚Äô (Bj√∏rn-Andersen et al., 1986). Technology was found not to be an exogenous, deterministic vari- able but a variable for which humans were able, to a large extent, to inÔ¨Çuence IT impact, for example, the desired level of centralization. Even though IT and computer systems were found to be very much the result of a design process, their eventual impact was found to be the result of more or less explicit choices taken early in the design process. Accordingly, it was argued that at any particular point in time the IT system for a given organization can have very different implications, and the concrete outcome is very much a function of design and implementation activities, as pointed out by Ken D. Eason in his book ‚ÄòInformation Technology and Organizational Change‚Äô (1988), which, for many years, was the textbook the Ô¨Årst author used in his classes on the implementation of IT. Overall, the dominating perspective in the 60s and 70s was that computers (or IT) were a powerful exogenous force that had a deterministic impact on clerks, managers and organizational structure.  3.2. 1980s:  IT impact on organizational design  The number of IT impact studies grew in the 80s, with the dominating research questions changing to relate more to the impact of IT on the process of organizational design. Given the accumulated knowledge about the predominantly negative im- pacts of IT on organizations and individuals, practitioners and re- searchers became interested in exploring how IT could improve the working conditions and the design of organizations in order to make them more effective and efÔ¨Åcient. Among the major research perspectives used in this decade, two of them could be identiÔ¨Åed as being more closely related to the topic of this paper: the so-called socio-technical perspective spearheaded by Enid Mumford (Mumford and Weir, 1979) in the Ethics method, and the political perspective largely used to study the collaboration efforts with  
190  N. Bj√∏rn-Andersen, B. Raymond / Applied Ergonomics 45 (2014) 188e197  trade unions in the NJMF project (Nygaard and Bergo, 1974) and the DUE project (Kyng and Mathiassen, 1980). For an overview, see Bansler (1989). Both from the socio-technical and the political perspective, there was a strong emphasis on user participation or democrati- zation of systems development. But the method and format were different. In the socio-technical perspective, which was also the one pursued by Ken D. Eason (1988), the actual end-users, who were to work with the new IT-system, took part in the systems design together with specialists and managers (Mumford and Weir, 1979). The basic premise was that users, specialists and management together should work out the proper design of the new systems, including its job design. From the political perspective, the premise was that in such a socio-technical process, users would not stand a chance, due to information asymmetry and lack of power. Accordingly, democratization would just be an effective way of implementing the new system, and if the users interest should be truly taken into account, the democratization process had to be anchored in ‚Äòcentral support from the trade union for decentralized action‚Äô (Nygaard and Bergo, 1974). For an overview, see Bansler (1989) and Bjerkeness and Bratteteig (1995). Regarding management, the beginning of the 80s brought the introduction of the Japanese management concepts of quality cir- cles, Ô¨Çexible, agile and just-in-time (e.g., McMillan, 1996), as well as the very broad-based trend towards the concept of business excellence, as exempliÔ¨Åed in the EFQM awards (see www.efqm. org). Moreover, this decade saw the development of new types or models of organizations, such as the ‚ÄòShamrock organization‚Äô (Handy, 1990) and the ‚ÄòLattice organization‚Äô (Gore, 1985). Even though many of these new organizational models, visions and concepts came from business schools and management consul- tants, they were, to a large extent, based on the development of IT as enabling new organizational forms.  3.3. 1990s:  IT impact on inter-organizational design  The need to look at organizations as part of value chains or value networks - instead of isolated individual organizations e became clearer in the 90s. General Motors was not competing with Ford; it was the full value network of GM cars competing with the full value network of Ford cars competing. (For textbook discussions, see e.g., Grant, 2010). As a result, optimizing for the organization itself was found to be much less effective than optimizing the total value chain or network and thus contributed to the development of inter- organizational IT systems such as electronic data interchange (EDI) systems (Krcmar et al., 1995). Since no chain is stronger than its weakest link, the implementation and use of new inter- organizational IT systems became a key strategy for many organizations. The development of new inter-organizational information sys- tems and technologies contributed to removal of organizational barriers and facilitating communications between organizations. They also contributed to decreasing transaction costs and making it easier for organizations to source from the market rather than producing internally (Grant, 2010). This meant that for many or- ganizations it became much more advantageous to concentrate on core business processes and outsource other business processes from external organizations offering ‚Äòbest-of-breed‚Äô practices. These IT opportunities contributed to the creation of new organi- zational forms. One example was the very popular concept of ‚Äòvir- tual organization‚Äô (Dubinskas and Hargreaves, 1993; Handy, 1995; Malone and Laubacher, 1998; Mandy, 1995; Voss, 1996). Another related example was the concept of ‚Äôboundaryless or- ganization‚Äô propagated by former General Electric chairman John Francis ‚ÄúJack‚Äù Welch, Jr. in his address to the shareholder meeting in  1990: ‚ÄòOur dream for the 1990s is a boundaryless company, a company where we have to knock down the walls that separate us from each other on the inside, and separate us from our key con- stituencies on the other side.‚Äô A third example was the introduction of the concept of the ‚Äòspaghetti organization.‚Äô This name was given by the CEO of the Oticon Company, Lars Kolind, for the organization after its total metamorphosis. This case attracted interest of several researchers, such as Morsing and Schultz (1998), who carried out a comprehensive analysis of this new organizational model as well as Bj√∏rn-Andersen and Turner (1998), who investigated the role of IT in this metamorphosis. IT provided for much more transparency, connectivity and knowledge utilization, leading to these new more effective organizational models. Within mainstream management, this decade saw the intro- duction of new management concepts, such as the ‚ÄòPostmodern‚Äô and ‚ÄòScandinavian‚Äô management models, emphasizing a more democratic leadership style with a high level of delegation. It was realized in this decade that IT was making it possible to have centralized control and, at the same time, provide a substantial delegation of the decision-making processes due to higher level of overall transparency and accountability.  3.4.  2000s:  IT impact on organizational re-invention  In this Ô¨Årst decade of the twenty Ô¨Årst century the continuous development of IT contributed to increasing the competition in the business environment, for example, by reducing barriers to entry in several markets, increasing information transparency about costs and prices and making competitive advantages more difÔ¨Åcult to sustain (Grant, 2010). This increasingly competitive business envi- ronment e combined with the increasing diversity and complexity of almost any product and service delivery, as well as the new information-based economy fueled by the World Wide Web and the Internet (Porter, 2001) e contributed to the emergence of new organizational models based on the principles of innovation and re- invention. Models such as the ‚ÄòNew Virtual Organization‚Äô and ‚ÄòNew Virtual Eco-system‚Äô were introduced in this decade in response to the new challenges that Evans and Wurster (1997) describe: ‚ÄòOver the next decade, the new economics of information will precipitate changes in the structure of entire industries and the way companies compete‚Äô (p. 71). The CEO of Cisco, John Chambers, noted in the 2003 annual report: ‚ÄòThe New Virtual Organization is the most fundamental and signiÔ¨Åcant change in organizational structure, we have ever experienced.‚Äô These networked organizations attracted researchers such as Hacki and Lighton (2001), who founded a subgroup of very successful organizations coined as ‚ÄòNetwork Or- chestrators‚Äô. These organizations were able to establish compre- hensive gated networks of suppliers and partners using standard functions as a lingua franca for exchanging information of all types. For instance, eBay became a particularly good example of a network orchestrator. Moreover, as their name suggests, these models went beyond the traditional virtual organization model in which only non-core business processes were outsourced. The rationale for sourcing core business processes will be discussed in detail in the next section. In summary, while not exhaustive, Fig. 1 below depicts graphi- cally the key IT-enabled organizational models discussed earlier according to their approximate time of adoption. Obviously, there can be some discussion about the exact position of the introduction of these organizational models. For instance, focusing on the time these organizational models were Ô¨Årst introduced instead of the time of their more widespread adoption by organizations is likely to produce different results. However, the main thrust should be clear: IT does not have a deterministic impact, but IT has enabled  
N. Bj√∏rn-Andersen, B. Raymond / Applied Ergonomics 45 (2014) 188e197  191  Fig. 1.  IT-enabled organizational models.  novel ways of organizing, which are likely to be much more effective for a large number of organizations in their pursuit of providing value for their customers, as pointed out among others by Bj√∏rn-Andersen et al. (1986). As we can see, there seems to be overwhelming evidence that the continuous IT development has contributed to the emergence of important organizational models over time regarding the crea- tion of new working situations for workers and management. We argue that IT development has not reached a plateau. On the con- trary, it will continue and even accelerate in the future. This will lead to the emergence of a new organizational model that we call the ‚ÄòAmbient Organization‚Äô representing an organization that is even more networked, more distributed, more knowledge- intensive and to a much higher degree sourced from others than what we see today. The next section presents the theoretical ar- guments supporting these claims.  4.  Theoretical arguments  For organizations, the costs of delivering a product or service to customers can be seen as consisting of two types of costs: pro- duction costs and transaction costs (Wallis and North, 1986; p. 97). Production costs (or as the authors term it, transformation costs) are deÔ¨Åned as the costs of transforming inputs into outputs or the direct production expenses. Transaction costs, on the other hand, are deÔ¨Åned as the costs of making an exchange or the indirect production expenses. Both of these two cost categories are dramatically changed when buying instead of producing using in- house production. Production costs are typically lower in the market, unless the company in question is the most low cost pro- ducer globally. Transaction costs, Ô¨Årst coined by Commons (1931), later pointedly discussed by Coase (1937) in his insightful analysis of why we have Ô¨Årms, and most decisively discussed by Williamson (1995), include:   searching costs to Ô¨Ånd potential suppliers  transportation costs to bring components to where they will be  inventory holding costs to prevent Ô¨Çuctuations in supply used  quality assurance costs  communication and coordination costs between the organi-  costs of writing and enforcing contracts with external suppliers zation and its external suppliers  If we Ô¨Årst look at production costs, it is clear that the impact of IT has contributed to the reduction of production costs, e.g., through  minimizing stocks, improving supply chains and creating more Ô¨Çexible production. However, it is also clear that production costs have been reduced both when using in-house production and when buying in the market. If anything, production costs have probably been reduced faster for the most effective low cost pro- ducer in the market than for a company not having this production as its core (Williamson, 1995). But if we look at transaction costs, we see a very different pic- ture. With the exception of the costs of writing and enforcing contracts with external suppliers, IT and telecommunication have dramatically reduced all types of transaction costs over time. Today (and predicted to be even more so in the coming decades) the transaction costs for sourcing externally from the market are approaching the costs of sourcing internally from the organization‚Äôs own hierarchy. Moreover, since the production costs of the most effective and efÔ¨Åcient suppliers in the market are likely to be sub- stantially lower than those of most organizations, we are seeing a strong tendency towards the adoption of various sourcing ar- rangements through which a decreasing number of processes related to the provision of products and services to customers are produced in a traditional hierarchy (Gurbaxani and Whang, 1991). Because of the dramatic decrease in transaction costs and the fact that most organizations will always be producing at higher costs than the best organizations in the market, it will become more advantageous for many organizations to source from the market rather than to produce internally. Continuous IT development in almost all areas of business is creating new opportunities over time for new ways of organizing and sourcing. In this way, transaction cost economics provides important theoretical reasons to explain the increase in sourcing adopted by organizations over time. In the words of Coase (1937): ‚ÄòFirms exist because the costs for frequent transactions are lower in a formal contract or hierarchy (internal production) than in the market‚Äô. Over the last more than 100 years, we have seen the emergence of large hierarchical organizations, mainly based upon the fact that it has been more advantageous to produce internally in the hierarchy rather than to buy in the marketplace. The tools and capabilities for managing and coordinating activities inside the organization have been far more effective and efÔ¨Åcient than trying to manage and coordinate activities outside the organization with many suppliers and partners in the market. But this equation is reversed due to the introduction and widespread adoption of IT in all business pro- cesses, and we see across all industry sectors a widespread ten- dency to source from the market (Lacity and Willcocks, 2012). An important part of transactions costs not mentioned thus far includes the motivation costs related to sourcing from the market,  
192  N. Bj√∏rn-Andersen, B. Raymond / Applied Ergonomics 45 (2014) 188e197  which could be divided into costs of cheating or opportunistic behavior by the agent (Williamson, 1975), the so-called Agency costs (Milgrom and Roberts, 1992). These can reduce the extent to which organizations will source from external providers. For example, Agency Theory explains the agency costs resulting from having ‚Äòothers than the principal‚Äô carrying out a speciÔ¨Åc task (Gurbaxani and Whang, 1991). As such, the decrease in transaction costs driving organizations towards sourcing from the market has to be balanced against the agency costs associated with the use of external agents. However, agency costs are also likely to diminish with increased use of IT, e.g., for supervision and control of the agent. Accordingly, we argue that the overall picture is one- directional: we shall see a strong increase in different types of sourcing arrangements eventually leading to an organizational model that we call the ‚ÄòAmbient organization‚Äô. Before beginning that discussion, we shall Ô¨Årst present a new type of organization providing IT-based platforms that facilitate the transactions between companies interested in sourcing and external providers of sourcing arrangements. Later in section six, we shall provide a taxonomy of sourcing types, relevant for char- acterizing the development of how organizations are stripping themselves of non-core, as well as core, functions or processes.  5. Development of new external IT-based platforms  The IT development in general, and the Internet development in particular, have enabled the emergence of organizations offering new IT-based platforms for connecting buyers and vendors of sourcing services. These new IT-based platform providers contribute to decreasing the transactions costs related to outsourcing of business processes, including processes hitherto considered core. New IT-based cloud computing services are pro- vided by traditional IT hardware suppliers (Intel, Cisco, Microsoft, IBM, etc.), facility management Ô¨Årms (Microsoft, Infosys, Cap Gemini, CSC, etc.), as well as new entrants such as Amazon and Google. A few examples of some of the most important new IT- based platforms are presented below.  5.1. New IT-based platforms supporting trading  In the early days of the dot.com age, namely in the late 90‚Äôs, we saw steep growth in so-called online or electronic marketplaces (e- marketplaces) supported by IT-based platforms. Gartner Group even predicted in 2000 that the number of those e-marketplaces would exceed 10,000 by the end of 2009. However, an over- whelming part of these original e-marketplaces have disappeared because the market liquidity was simply not there and did not come. Many reasons can explain this situation. First, vendors could not Ô¨Ågure out how to avoid a perfect price competition eroding proÔ¨Åts for everybody, and the winning vendor often got the con- tract with an unproÔ¨Åtable deal. Second, buyers were skeptical about the quality and reliability of supplied goods and services. Third, and partly as a consequence of the Ô¨Årst two reasons, e- marketplaces had a hard time Ô¨Ånding a sustainable business model that would make buyers and vendors come back and not trade outside the e-marketplace. Today, far fewer e-marketplaces have survived and Ô¨Çourished. For example, Amazon allows other merchants to sell their products to customers through its IT-based platform, and it has now become one of the world‚Äôs largest online retailers next to becoming a major provider of cloud computing services. Another spectacular success is the Chinese business-to-business (B2B) e-marketplace, Alibaba. com. Started in 2003, the company now employs 12,000 em- ployees and is boasting that at any point in time, they have about 6 million transactions between buyers and vendors taking place  simultaneously. It offers unlimited trading for an annual fee of $300 for Chinese companies and $4000 for non-Chinese companies. One might say that Alibaba, to a very high degree, is enabling China to become the manufacturing hub of the world. However, Alibaba is not only connecting buyers and vendors through its IT-based platform, but it is also providing a number of services to facilitate online trading such as credit rating, logistics and procurement services. Interestingly, despite the high level of initial investment and the trivial initial amounts charged to customers for using its services, the combination of the very effective and efÔ¨Åcient infor- mation systems - combined with millions of customers e yield very attractive revenues to such companies.  5.2.  Companies are offering to take over business processes  As a natural extension of the outsourcing seen so abundantly within the IT Ô¨Åeld, a number of companies are now offering Busi- ness Process Outsourcing, where the outsourcer is sourcing full business processes from a third party. Large companies offering such services include US based companies (e.g., Accenture, HP and IBM) as well as European companies (e.g., Cap Gemini) and Asian companies (e.g., Infosys, TCS and Wipro), but there are also many smaller companies offering specialized services where they take over, e.g., the HR function, travel reimbursement functions, etc. (Lacity and Willcocks, 2012).  5.3. New IT-based platforms supporting innovation  We have also seen the development by external providers of new IT-based platforms supporting open innovation. These IT- based platforms support open innovation, for example, by facili- tating the cloudsourcing and crowdsourcing of innovative ideas through the Internet. For example, Albert Angern and his research group at INSEAD have developed and provide the InnoTube plat- form (www.calt.insead.edu), a Web-based system aimed at sup- porting and stimulating innovation-centered knowledge exchange among distributed groups and communities. This IT-based platform includes more than twenty tools to support the sourcing of inno- vation from third parties. Another example of a platform to support innovation is the so- called ‚ÄòMechanical Turk‚Äô launched by Amazon in 2005. The Me- chanical Turk is an IT-based platform designed to enable crowd- sourcing of innovation by providing a website, an e-marketplace and a Web service on the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) for the exchange of innovative ideas. Basically, the requester (an individual or an organization) places any type of human intel- ligence task (HIT) on the website with the use of an application programming interface (API). It is even possible for the requester to ask for particular qualiÔ¨Åcations of workers. Potential workers can then browse the various human intelligence tasks to Ô¨Ånd inter- esting tasks worthy of their time/energy and perform the selected tasks. Workers are paid upon delivery of their work through an electronic funds transfer via PayPal or Amazon‚Äôs gift certiÔ¨Åcates. A Ô¨Ånal example is the IT-based platform provided by the open innovation company, InnoCentive, initially funded by Eli Lilly. InnoCentive helps organizations to achieve innovative business results by crowdsourcing innovative ideas from a Web community of about 200,000 experts. Basically, InnoCentive takes research and development problems related to a broad range of domains, framing them as ‚Äòchallenge problems‚Äô for anyone to solve, and gives cash awards for the best solutions to solvers who meet the chal- lenge criteria. It also provides a suite of training and implementa- tion services called the Open iNnovation Rapid Adoption "
s0003687013001257,"  The personal protective equipment (PPE) worn by Ô¨ÅreÔ¨Åghters is designed to protect against thermal injuries, products of combustion, scrapes and abrasions and falling objects. The personal protective clothing (PPC), or turnout (TO) gear, is speciÔ¨Åcally designed to protect against thermal injury and includes a thermal layer and a moisture barrier layer to prevent hot water passing through the material to the Ô¨ÅreÔ¨Åghter. The turnout gear that Ô¨ÅreÔ¨Åghters wear is typically man- ufactured to meet speciÔ¨Åc industry standards (NFPA, 2006) for thermal protection and evaporative heat transfer. Paradoxically, the equipment designed to afford protection also contributes to the physiological and perceptual strain experienced by the Ô¨ÅreÔ¨Åghter. The increased physiological strain associated with working in PPE is well documented (Cheung et al., 2010; Duncan et al., 1979; Nunneley, 1989; Sk√∂ldstr√∂m, 1987; Smith and Petruzzello, 1998; Smith et al., 1995), with both the added mass of the gear, and the gear‚Äôs insu- lating and encapsulating properties, and the positioning of the added mass contributing to the strain (Haisman, 1988).  * Corresponding author.

However, the entire clothing ensemble, including the base layer or undergarment, would be expected to inÔ¨Çuence both thermal protection afforded and the transfer of moisture through the garment. Furthermore, some newly developed technical tex- tiles are designed to wick moisture away from the skin and enhance evaporative cooling, whereas others may attenuate increases in temperature through the absorption of heat using phase change materials (Mondal, 2008). In addition to physiological and perceptual beneÔ¨Åts, it is possible that different base layer textiles may be sensed as being more comfortable than standard fabrics. The performance of different base layers under protective gear has been examined by several researchers. Wickwire et al. (2007) determined that a snug-Ô¨Åtting synthetic shirt with moisture- wicking properties worn under a bulletproof vest did not enhance cooling compared with a 100% cotton shirt. Similarly, van den Heuvel et al. (2010) observed no differences in measures of physiological or perceived strain among Ô¨Åve different base layer conÔ¨Ågurations when worn under a standard combat uniform and body armor. Under a combat uniform alone, Fogarty et al. (2009) detected no differences in core temperature (Tco), skin tempera- ture (Tsk), heart rate (HR) or psychophysical variables between a 100% cotton t-shirt and polyester shirt.  0003-6870/$ e see front matter √ì 2013 Elsevier Ltd and The Ergonomics Society.

D.L. Smith et al.  / Applied Ergonomics 45 (2014) 428e436  429  Previous studies (Fogarty et al., 2009; van den Heuvel et al., 2010) that investigated the effect of a base layer worn under PPE have relied on continuous workloads where the participants wore the ensembles throughout the protocol. We are unaware of any data on the effect of different base layers on physiological and perceptual measures when the wearer is able to doff the protective clothing during planned recovery cycles. This is particularly relevant for Ô¨ÅreÔ¨Åghting because Ô¨ÅreÔ¨Åghters are encouraged or mandated to take breaks that include dofÔ¨Ång their PPC during ‚Äúrehabilitation‚Äù with the goal of reducing heat strain and hastening physiological recovery. If base layers could facilitate cardiovascular, thermal or perceptual recovery during planned cooling periods, the cumulative strain experienced by a Ô¨ÅreÔ¨Åghter over a speciÔ¨Åc time period could be lessened or the Ô¨Åre- Ô¨Åghter might be able to extend their time to fatigue. The aims of this study were to evaluate the effect of different base layers worn under Ô¨ÅreÔ¨Åghting PPE on physiological and perceptual strain during an alternating work/recovery exercise protocol, to describe individual sensations to different base layers, and to assess the materials performance of the base layers indi- vidually and with turnout gear.  2. "
s0003687013001269,"  Work-related musculoskeletal disorders (WMSDs), which most often occur in industries such as production assembly and auto- repair, have recently drawn considerable attention. According to previous researches, many WMSDs have been reported in industry workers due to tasks that involve high risk activities such as the lifting and carrying of heavy objects, repetitive motions and exer- tions, insufÔ¨Åcient resting time, awkward body postures, and vibrations (Putz-Anderson, 1988; Armstrong et al., 1990; Punnett et al., 1991; Bernard, 1997). Researchers have sought to lower the incidence rate of WMSDs, but it has remained stubbornly high. The incidence rate of WMSDs is greater in the upper limbs than in the lower limbs (Baker, 1995; Macleod, 1999). According to data from the Industrial Accident Examination (KOSHA, 2008), the incidence rate of upper limb WMSDs, relative to occurrences of all WMSDs, has gradually increased from 29.9% in 2005 to 37.6% in 2006 and  * Corresponding author.

Generally, WMSDs affect the upper limbs because workers repeatedly use tools or carry heavy items, often employing their upper limb joints such as the wrist, elbow, shoulder, and neck. Workers can succumb to WMSDs due to unsuitable work envi- ronments, for example where workers are required to contort their limbs in unnatural ways (Macleod, 1999). Grip force is used in general tasks and is also needed for repeated handling (Gurram et al., 1993; Dubrowski and Carnahan, 2004). Generally, over- exertion and repetitive grip forces are required in maintenance, fastening and repair activities in which hand tools are used. When using hand tools, WMSDs can be caused by excessive radial or ulnar deviation or bent wrists (Armstrong et al., 1990). It has been re- ported that the generation of excessive forces, improper posture, extreme temperatures, vibrations, and other variables can also lead to losses of grip force (Kattle et al., 1996). It has been suggested that WMSDs could be reduced if hand tools were ergonomically designed with a focus on the comfort and safety of the tool users (Lewis and Narayan, 1993). The provision of adequate resting time and limitation of repe- titions between rest periods are important factors in preventing WMSDs and improving operational efÔ¨Åciency and  0003-6870/$ e see front matter √ì 2013 Elsevier Ltd and The Ergonomics Society.

However, relatively few studies have investigated the ef- fects of resting time and repetition of force exertions on the total grip strength and individual Ô¨Ånger forces in a maximum grasping task. Mathiowetz (1990) and Shechtman et al. (2007) only showed that grip force is reduced as the gripping task is repeated. Caldwell et al. (1974), Trossman and Li (1989), Garg et al. (2005), and Chow and Dickerson (2009) analyzed the reduction of grip force with 1e 3 min of resting time, which is advised to minimize the conse- quences of fatigue. There is a lack of research Ô¨Åndings addressing the sufÔ¨Åciency of resting times relative to the number of trials in a grasping task. Some researchers have applied different resting times and number of grasping task trials for each set of experiments (Caldwell et al., 1974; Trossman and Li, 1989; Montazer and Thomas, 1992; Shechtman et al., 2007; Kwak et al., 2010). Table 1 indicates  resting times and the number of trials researchers used for their grip strength measurement experiments, which of course have varying results due to the different lengths of resting time. Accordingly, the objectives of this study were to: (1) analyze the effects of resting time and the number of trials on the total grip strength and individual Ô¨Ånger force in a maximum grasping task and, based on the study, (2) provide suggestions on the proper amount of resting time associated with the number of gripping measurement tasks and trials.  2.

s0003687013001282,"  The computer mouse is commonly used with graphic user in- terfaces. Using a computer mouse comprises one- to two-thirds of total computer usage time (Cook et al., 2000; Lee et al., 2008). In addition, the most frequently used input device among computer users is the computer mouse (Cook and Kothiyal, 1998; Jensen et al., 2002; Muller et al., 2010). The conventional computer mouse has been identiÔ¨Åed as a risk factor for upper extremity musculoskeletal disorders (WMSDs) and localized pain. The conventional mouse requires a user to pronate the forearm and to extend the wrist during operation (Gustafsson and Hagberg, 2003). The pronation of the forearm may result in the development of WMSDs (Zipp et al., 1983; Hagberg, 1997; Liao and Drury, 2000). The extension of the wrist increases carpal tunnel pressure (CTP), which would be a potential risk factor for carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) (Keir et al., 1999; Fogleman and Brogmus, 1995; Bower et al., 2006; Mogk and Keir, 2007). In addition, the conventional mouse may lead to micro lesions in the low-threshold motor units because they have been continuously activated while using a computer mouse (called Cinderella Hypothesis; Crenshaw et al., 2007). Therefore, prolonged awkward posture and  * Tel.: √æ82 52 259 2709; fax: √æ82 52 259 1683.

Slanted ergonomic mice have been introduced to reduce the negative effects of the conventional mouse in terms of arm posture, muscular activity, and CTP. The key feature of the ergonomic mice is the slanted angle of the top surface from the left side to the right side. The slant surface, contacted with the palmar side of the hand, can signiÔ¨Åcantly reduce forearm pronation and wrist extension (Muller et al., 2010; Chen and Leung, 2007; Hedge et al., 2010) as well as reduce demands on muscle recruitments in the upper ex- tremities and CTP at the wrist (Gustafsson and Hagberg, 2003). The slant surface of an ergonomic mouse can restrict perfor- mance during mouse usage tasks and can affect the level of sub- jective preference. Gustafsson and Hagberg (2003) reported that use of a vertical mouse (slant angle ¬º 90 ) decreased productivity by 24% in comparison with a conventional mouse. Furthermore, their subjective preference results showed that most of the par- ticipants preferred the conventional mouse more than the vertical mouse. Similarly, Scarlett et al. (2005) has revealed that use of a vertical mouse showed worse completion time and error rate than a conventional mouse by 10% and 20%, respectively. Although the slant angle of a computer mouse seems to nega- tively affect the task performance and subjective preference, its effects haven‚Äôt been comprehensively studied yet.

K.  Jung / Applied Ergonomics 45 (2014) 450e455  451  extremity muscle use, and suggested that the optimal slant angle is between 20 and 30 . However, they did not consider performance or subjective measures in the determination of optimal slant angle, although the results on physiological measures (e.g., EMG) may be different from performance and subjective measures (Niesen and Levy, 1994; Gustafsson and Hagberg, 2003). Therefore, to under- stand the beneÔ¨Åts of the slanted ergonomic mouse in comparison with the conventional mouse, the effects of slant angle on task performance and subjective responses should be examined. The present study investigated the effects of two slanted ergo- nomic mice (slant angle: 30 and 50 ) on task performance and subjective responses in comparison with a conventional mouse (slant angle: 0 ). To compare the performance and subjective re- sponses among the target mice, an experiment consisting of two mouse-intensive tasks (pointing and dragging) was conducted with 40 participants.  2.  Experimental methods  2.1.  Participants  Forty participants in their 20s were involved in this study. Twenty of them were male and 20 were female. The average ages for male and female were 23.2 (SD ¬º 2.6) and 21.7 (SD ¬º 1.8) years, respectively. The dominant hand of all participants was the right hand. No participant had any muscular symptom or discomfort on the experimental day. The average hand lengths of male and female were 18.1 (SD: 7.5) cm and 17.2 (SD: 7.7) cm, which are similar to those of Korean male (mean: 18.6, SD: 8.1) and female (mean: 17.5, SD: 7.8) in their 20s. None of them had experience using a slanted mouse before this experiment.  2.2.  Experimental design  This study included two independent variables: mouse type (3 levels) and mouse task (2 levels). The mouse type consisted of three levels (Fig. 1): CM (slant angle ¬º 0 ), SM30 (30 ), and SM50 (50 ). The two slanted mice (SM) with different slant angle at the top surface were selected. As the conventional mouse (CM), a popular and common mouse was chosen. The target mice had slightly different speciÔ¨Åcations in overall size and weight as displayed in Table 1. The mouse task was comprised two levels: pointing task (PT) and dragging task (DT). The PT as shown in Fig. 2a is to move a mouse arrow toward a target button (size: 1 cm  1 cm) and then click it. The DT as displayed in Fig. 2b is to move a mouse arrow to a movable object (size: 1 cm  1 cm), and to drag that object into the target region (size: 1 cm  1 cm). The positions of all the objects in the PT and DT were randomly decided. There were four dependent variables in the present study: task completion time (Time), error rate per 15-trials (Error), perceived discomfort score (Discomfort), and overall satisfaction score (Satis- faction). The Time was measured from the starting time to the  Table 1 SpeciÔ¨Åcations of the target mice.

The Error was calculated by the number of errors made during 15 trials of a task. The Discomfort was obtained for each part of the arm (Fig. 3a) with Borg‚Äôs CR-10 scale (Fig. 3b; Borg, 1998; Kwon et al., 2009). Lastly, the Satisfaction was obtained using a 7-point bipolar scale (Fig. 3c; Tuorila et al., 2008). Experimental software was developed using Visual Basic 6.0 (Microsoft, USA), which automatically randomizes the presentation order of experimental conditions and records the task performance (Time and Error). In order to conÔ¨Årm that the positions of the button and movable object, presented in the PT and DT, were randomly decided across the experimental conditions and partici- pants, the software was designed to record their positions. A desktop computer, operated by Window XP, was used in the experiment. A computer screen (19 inch) was located on about 60 cm from the eyes, and a standard keyboard was placed on about 40 cm from the participant. The experimental mouse was set on the right side of the keyboard. The table height was 70 cm from the Ô¨Çoor and the seat height was adjusted by the participants to Ô¨Åt their body sizes. The experimental procedure followed four steps. In the Ô¨Årst step, informed consent was secured and the experimental purpose was well informed to the participant. In the second step, sufÔ¨Åcient practice (180 trials: 3 (mouse)  2 (task)  30 (repetition)) was allowed to accustom each participant to the experimental tasks and the target mice. In the third step, two sessions of the main exper- iment (360 trials: 2 (session)  3 (mouse)  2 (task)  30 (repe- tition)) were conducted. A 5-min break was allowed between sessions to minimize fatigue effect. The presentation order of all experimental conditions was randomized by the experimental software. During the second session, the Discomfort on each part of the arm was obtained. In the Ô¨Ånal step, the Satisfaction on the three mice was surveyed and an in-depth debrieÔ¨Ång was completed.  2.3.  Statistical analysis  All statistical tests were conducted by Minitab v16.0 (Minitab Inc., USA) with a 0.05 conÔ¨Ådence level.

In addition, t-test was completed on the pointing and dragging distance results, which were randomly determined by the experimental software.

The correlations between Satisfaction and Discomfort on showed negative relationships: hand (r ¬º  0.52, all body parts p < 0.01), wrist (r ¬º  0.46, p < 0.01), upper-arm (r ¬º  0.42, p < 0.01), lower-arm (r ¬º  0.39, p < 0.01), shoulder (r ¬º  0.31, p < 0.01), and elbow (r ¬º  0.27, p < 0.01). Similarly, negative correlations between Satisfaction and the task performance measures were observed: Time (r ¬º  0.19, p ¬º 0.02) and Error (r ¬º  0.17, p ¬º 0.04).  4. Discussion  The actual differences among the task performances of the three mice were small, although they were statistically signiÔ¨Åcant. The maximum difference in Time among the three mice was only 0.07 s (% difference ¬º 11). The max difference of the Error was only 0.37 per 15 trials. This small performance decrement for the new type of mice was already reported in previous studies. Gustafsson and found that a vertical mouse (slant angle ¬º 90 ) Hagberg (2003) decreased a w24% productivity in comparison with a conventional mouse during a document editing task. Muller et al. (2010) showed that a pen-type mouse had about 14% worse performance than a conventional mouse in pointing and dragging tasks. The participants didn‚Äôt prefer to the slanted mice in comparison with the CM. The Satisfactions on the two slanted mice (SM30 ¬º  0.09; SM50 ¬º  0.77) were all negative, indicating slight dissatisfaction. Contrary, the Satisfaction of the CM (1.21) was a positive value, which indicates slight satisfaction. This trend in user satisfaction for the new type of mice corresponded with previous studies‚Äô results for a vertical mouse (Gustafsson and Hagberg, 2003) and a pen-type mouse (Muller et al., 2010). The in-depth debrieÔ¨Ång of the present study provided a cogent reason for the decrease in Satisfaction with the slanted mice. Most of the participants emphasized that the slanted mice required exces- sive use of wrist deviation during operation in comparison with the CM. In addition, some of the participants claimed that wrist devia- forearm position (0 ) was harder than tion motion in the neutral that in the pronated forearm position (90 ). This subjective opinion may result from the reduction of the range of motion (ROM) at the wrist joint while forearm pronation (ChafÔ¨Ån et al., 1999). The results of the present study were possibly contaminated by confounding design speciÔ¨Åcation of the target mice. Since the present study used the three mice available in the market, the design speci- Ô¨Åcations such as overall weight and size, which were not focused on this study, could not be perfectly controlled across the target mice. For example, the slanted mice were slightly heavier (SM30 ¬º 120 g, SM50 ¬º 130 g) and bigger (SM30 ¬º 7.3  10.6  5.2, SM50 ¬º 8.2  10.0  8.0; unit: cm) than the CM (80 g, 5.5  11.0  3.5). These differences might affect the experimental results. Although the slanted mice were slightly heavier and bigger than the CM, they still have a biomechanical beneÔ¨Åt in terms of muscular activity. As a follow-up study, the effect of the slanted mice on the muscular activity of extensor carpi radialis (ECR), which relates to wrist extension and deviation motions (Chen and Leung, 2007; Agarabi et al., 2004), had been investigated for a single participant. A root mean square (RMS) analysis for that participant showed that mean RMS values of the SM30 (24.1 mV) and SM50 (28.1 mV) were lower than that of the CM (36.6 mV) during the PT and DT. This indicated that the slanted mice required less muscular activities in comparison with the CM, although they were slightly heavier and bigger. The similar tendency was already found in Chen and Leung (2007) who investigates EMG signals on different slanted mice angle ¬º 0 , 10 , 20 , 25 , 30 ) with (slant different weights (range ¬º 80.7 ge100.1 g).

(b) Overall satisfaction score  Long-term use of the slanted mice may improve task perfor- mance due to learning effect (Kotani and Horii, 2003), but the slanted mice still have a weakness in comparison with the CM. As a follow-up experiment, the present study conducted the same experiment with a participant who had been using one of the slanted mice (SM50) for three months. The participant began to use the slanted mouse due to neck and shoulder pain caused by extensive use of a conventional mouse. She was totally satisÔ¨Åed with the slanted mouse and believed that it signiÔ¨Åcantly relieved her pain as reported in Aaras et al. (2001). However, the experi- mental results of that participant showed that the task perfor- mance of the slanted mice (mean: 0.83) was still worse than that of the CM (mean: 0.56). This result agreed with what was found by Straker et al. (2000).  Acknowledgments  This work was supported by the 2012 Research Fund of Uni- versity of Ulsan.  "
s0003687013001294,"  Considerable information substantiates Ô¨ÅreÔ¨Åghting as one of the most hazardous civilian occupations, implying variable working conditions, unpredictable and heavy physical demands (Bos et al., 2004). FireÔ¨Åghters perform strenuous muscular work (i.e. climb stairs and ladders, carry and use heavy tools) in dangerous envi- ronments (extreme temperatures, toxic smoke) and chaotic con- ditions (loud noise and low visibility), under time urgency and psychological stress of knowing that civilians are in imminent danger. To reduce the risk of injuries, Ô¨ÅreÔ¨Åghters wear personal pro- tective devices, composed by layered thermal protective clothing, heavy footwear to protect against penetration and crush injuries, a helmet to protect the head and a Self-Contained Breathing Apparatus (S.C.B.A.) to protect against smoke and noxious gases. However, the use of S.C.B.A. (weighing 11e23 kg) can have negative effects on gait, metabolic and thermal efÔ¨Åciency, and fatigue (Perroni et al., 2008, 2009, 2010; Knapik et al., 2004; Blacker et al., 2010; Qu and Yeo, 2011).  * Corresponding author.

E-mail address:  Musculoskeletal injuries, traumas, respiratory and cardio- vascular diseases are the major risks resulting from exposure to multiple physical and chemical agents, and from particularly high level of stress experienced during emergency operations (Burnett et al., 1994). Recent statistics in the United States (C2 Technologies Report, 2007) reported that 46% or 55% of deaths were classiÔ¨Åed as the result of stress or overexertion that led to heart attack or stroke. Although the majority of these deaths were in Ô¨ÅreÔ¨Åghters over 45 years old, there were still 19 deaths due to heart attack for those under 45 years old. A study by Szubert and Sobala (2002) showed an analysis of the injury ratio (annual number of injuries per 1000 workers) by injury circumstances (Emergency operation, Physical training, Equip- ment maintenance and repair, Routine service, Commuting to/ from work) and victim‚Äôs age among Ô¨ÅreÔ¨Åghters. The ratio was the lowest (67.9) among Ô¨ÅreÔ¨Åghters aged 30e39 and the highest (76.1) among those aged more than 50 years. During compulsory physical training, accidents were less frequent (24.6) in the 40e49 Ô¨ÅreÔ¨Åghters age group than in 20e29 (30.8) and 50e59 (30.4) age groups. High levels of Ô¨Åtness have been correlated with improved job performance during real Ô¨ÅreÔ¨Åghting activities (Elsner and Kolkhorst, 2008; Michaelides et al., 2008; Rhea et al., 2004) and a decreased risk of injury (Knapik et al., 2001; Mattila et al., 2007).  0003-6870/$ e see front matter √ì 2013 Elsevier Ltd and The Ergonomics Society.

F. Perroni et al.  / Applied Ergonomics 45 (2014) 456e461  457  Unlike some sports or occupations that focus on a single training goal (e.g., power, strength, or endurance), Ô¨ÅreÔ¨Åghters are required to optimize multiple training goals simultaneously. For instance, they must possess power to perform forcible entry maneuvers, strength to advance hose lines and perform salvage and overhaul tasks, and aerobic and muscular endurance to carry equipment up Ô¨Çights of stairs. Given the limited availability of Ô¨ÅreÔ¨Åghters to take part in experimental settings during real emergencies, the physical de- mands and psychological distress of Ô¨ÅreÔ¨Åghters have been inves- tigated mainly in laboratory (Bruce-Low et al., 2007; Dreger et al., 2006) and in simulated Ô¨ÅreÔ¨Åghting activities (Eglin and Tipton, 2005; Harvey et al., 2008; Holmer and Gavhed, 2007; Perroni et al., 2010, 2009). Despite some authors (Bos et al., 2002; Kales et al., 2007; Rhea et al., 2004) indicated a minimum level of  1 min 45 mL kg to successfully complete intense Ô¨Åre- Ô¨Åghting tasks, few indications are available regarding the minimum standards of muscle strength (Gledhill and Jamnik, 1992; Garver et al., 2005; Henderson et al., 2007; Perroni et al., 2008). Given the nature of their employment, a physiological age- related decline could be expected during the occupational period of Ô¨ÅreÔ¨Åghters. Although in the literature there are numerous studies about the relationship between physical activity and aging, there are only few surveys about Ô¨ÅreÔ¨Åghters (Rhea et al., 2004; Sluiter and Frings-Dresen, 2007; Davis et al., 2002; Saupe et al., 1991). The purpose of this study was to compare the Ô¨Åtness status (i.e., muscle strength, power, sprint and endurance) of Italian Ô¨Åre- Ô¨Åghters recruits in relation to the age. It was hypothesized that the younger age of Ô¨ÅreÔ¨Åghters might result in a higher Ô¨Åtness perfor- mances and that wearing protective clothing and S.C.B.A. might reduce the performances.   1 VO2max  2.

s0003687013001300,"  The natural train-driving environment is complex, unpredict- able, and highly dynamic. Collision avoidance in this type of envi- ronment is inÔ¨Çuenced by a range of human factors issues and information processing limitations associated with sustaining attention for extended periods (Wickens and Carswell, 2007). Traditional train navigation requires the driver to process infor- mation sources held outside the cab (e.g., signals, speeds, land- marks) and apply a detailed body of route knowledge (acquired from experience). This allows the driver to connect their location with the upcoming destinations and optimise speed-error. In the traditional driver-cab, basic indicators such as a speedometer and braking gauges are used to fathom train state and carry out decision-making. Although train drivers only control the speed and acceleration of the train, train driving cognition is strategic, pur- posive (i.e., goal-directed), and quasi-mathematical (i.e., under- pinned by mental time-distance estimations) (Branton, 1979). Whilst rail industries the world over still employ legacy systems dating back to the mid-20th century (including those in ‚Äòdeveloped‚Äô countries), the last two decades have bore witness to a rapid growth in railway technology, and whilst train driving fundamen- tally remains unidirectional, emerging technologies are beginning to alter how train drivers correct speed-error, derive information, and correspond with their environment.  * Central Queensland University, Appleton Institute, 44 Greenhill Rd, Wayville, SA 5034, Australia.

Today, train technologies are designed around signal awareness (e.g., Automatic Warning System; McLeod et al., 2005), train pro- tection (e.g., Train Protection Warning System; Fenner, 2002) and ‚Äòsupervisory‚Äô control (e.g., Automatic Train Protection; Simpson, 1994). These systems and approaches have introduced increasing layers of autonomous control in the train. For example, the Auto- matic Train Protection system calculates braking distances and applies automatic brake applications if the train is likely to violate movement authority (i.e., line speeds and stop signals). In the more advanced rail networks, drivers use enhanced information displays to operate. These displays, held in the driverecab interface, advise train operation by previewing the route and speed trajectories (e.g., Einhorn et al., 2005; Howlett and Pudney, 2000; Kitto and Groves, 2011). Some of these technologies, such as Energymeiser (pictured Fig. 1a) aim to inform decision-making. In this system, a speed trajectory is calculated based on upcoming speeds, changes to the terrain, expected fuel use, and estimated arrival times. However, control is not forced or overridden by the system, and the driver is effectively left to operate using traditional driving principles, but under the guidance of a display that presents ‚Äúwhat-if‚Äù scenarios. Thus, the driver may elect to follow the optimal trajectory (depicted horizontally) and inÔ¨Çuence how conservatively it is calculated (using soft-keys to increase or decrease estimated arrival times), and whilst some movement authority is shown (i.e., line speeds), signals are still located outside the cab. Other systems migrate the signalling and movement authorities into the cab, and adopt a driver-train dynamic that relegates more control to the machine. For example, the European Train Control System (ETCS, pictured in Fig. 1b) previews the route but also  0003-6870/$ e see front matter √ì 2013 Elsevier Ltd and The Ergonomics Society.

Upcoming route features are displayed in a planning area along with a feature that instructs the time to brake, and the system applies automatic throttle/braking if speed deviates from these prescribed limits (CENELEC, 2005). In ETCS, the speed trajectory is also displayed around the outside (i.e., perimeter) of the speedometer. These are all important distinctions as the resulting driver-train dynamic operates within an observable margin that has an upper (max) and lower (min) boundary, which the needle of the speedometer should be kept within at all times. Thus, train driving is underpinned by a system that monitors what the train driver does and if system parameters are violated, driver control is overridden to return speed within the predeÔ¨Åned boundaries. This type of system does not aim to cater for ‚Äúwhat-if‚Äù type decision-making, but rather, aims to instruct and enforce a scripted type of control. This driver-train dynamic is deÔ¨Åned here as the ‚Äòmodern‚Äô train-driving task, where an in-cab authority enforces  how train movement and speed is regulated. In the case of the ETCS system, these are displayed to the driver with an enhanced infor- mation interface displaying a dynamic speed trajectory. Note that both the Energymeiser and ETCS systems are used in commercial intercity passenger and freight operations at the time of writing this paper. Clearly, there are immediate and observable differences be- tween Fig. 1a and b. For example, Energymeiser is horizontally oriented, whereas the ETCS system adopts a vertical orientation (i.e., towards direction of travel). However, irrespective of the similarities and differences, both of these displays show that rail technology is fundamentally evolving along the lines of augmented reality. This is where speciÔ¨Åc domain features from the natural rail environment are being abstracted into the cab. One direction leading on from this is to better support the traditional driving task (√† la Energymeiser), and the other, to hand one or more compo- nents of the task over to a machine authority (√† la ETCS).

464  A. Naweed / Applied Ergonomics 45 (2014) 462e470  say, the growth in technology has adjusted the task- and skill-based needs of the modern train driver, and engendered new models of task representation aiming to extend the knowledge base. These models can be divided broadly into situation- and skill-based cat- egories. Situational models typically extend Endsley‚Äôs (1995) gen- eral model of situation awareness to depict the factors and processes converging around the driver, and provide a holistic snapshot of the system at any one time (e.g., Luther et al., 2007; McLeod et al., 2005; Roth and Multer, 2009). Skill-based models describe the train driving process by emphasising the human ca- pabilities of the operator, and use cyclical feed-back/feed-forward processing loops with roots in control engineering (e.g., Hamilton and Clarke, 2005). Both types of model are extremely useful for conceptualising the process, illustrating the nature of the task, and showing performance constraints. However, there are a number of gaps in the current corpus of train driving performance literature that warrant further research. First, whilst studies have explored the human-train dynamics of situation awareness and driving skill in the traditional task, few have proÔ¨Åled how relatively complex, dynamic, and opaque the task actually is. These features form the theoretical underpinning for simulation design for operational task environments, and identifying them would better specify the development of full- task ecological research tools such as rail simulators, or part- task simulations of the train driving task, such as scaled worlds, and microworlds (Brehmer and D√∂rner, 1993; Ca√±as and Waern, 2005). Second, even fewer studies have extended their research of the human-train dynamic to the modern driving context. While some work has speculated over the potential impact of the modern task, explicit investigation of the skill- or situation-based aspects of train driving when speed is enforced and parameterised by enhanced information displays (e.g., like ETCS) has yet to be undertaken. Hamilton and Clarke (2005) described a short study that used behaviour modelling to explore this type of driving, but it was based on very early data. The main focus in this work was also on explanatory concepts (e.g., memory stores), not on examining the similarities or difference between driving in the traditional and modern contexts. Lastly, train driving performance models have been applied in a variety of settings, for example to predict the time and workload implications of different operating conditions (Hamilton and Clarke, 2005), or to evaluate perfor- mance in speciÔ¨Åc cultural contexts (Sani and Dawal, 2010). However, few have modelled performance to aid with the design and development of intelligent technologies based on speciÔ¨Åc skill (e.g., enhanced information displays). Taken together, these aims illustrate a general need to explore modern driving, and to develop a substantive train performance model that captures the different driving tasks, to meet the needs of wider communities of interest and practice (e.g., simulation development, display design).  2. Method  2.1. Design  Train driving expertise is tacit and intuitive (Branton, 1979). Thus, the study required a design that could unfurl and extract knowledge from humans in environments where the changing conditions, event densities, and performance pressures informed very speciÔ¨Åc motor skills and problem solving strategies (Cooke, 1994; Klein et al., 1989). In this study, data were collected using a novel method that converged observations and interviews from three frameworks for knowledge elicitation. These were Cognitive Work Analysis (CWA, Rasmussen et al., 1994; Vicente, 1999), Applied Cognitive Task Analysis (ACTA, Militello and Hutton, 1998), and Ground Theory (Glaser and Strauss, 1967). The CWA technique was used to explore the domain, its tasks, strategies, and socio-organisational structure, whilst ACTA was used to decompose work activities and provide information about task cognition. Grounded Theory was used to analyse the collected data, and draw on deductive categories from the simulation design Ô¨Åeld (i.e., complexity, dynamism, opacity) (Brehmer and D√∂rner, 1993). This explored the interactions between different rail elements, and examined the constraints, features, goals, and properties of the various functions, so that challenging aspects of the task could be generated thematically. Whilst the in- dividual utility of these methods is widely available in the literature, the utility and precedence for converging these type of methods has also been demonstrated (e.g., Chalmers et al., 2002; Neerincx and GrifÔ¨Åoen, 1996). Another methodological aim was for the data to be harnessed in a way that would be easily understood and used by substantive communities (of interest and practice). This is a key tenet of effective knowledge elicitation frameworks (Crandall et al., 2006), thus a number of data visualisation techniques were used over the course of the analysis. These were: the (1) task diagram (from ACTA); (2) the abstraction-decomposition space (from CWA); and (3) the concept mapping approach (Ca√±as et al., 2003). The task diagram represented 3-to-6 discrete steps in the train-driving task, as deÔ¨Åned by participants during interviews. The abstraction- decomposition space was a two-dimensional matrix that sepa- rated the strands of train driving into subtasks. It then identiÔ¨Åed the means-ends relationships of these subtasks (i.e., why e what e how) against the decomposed work domain (i.e., system e function e task e activity e tool/information). The concept mapping approach was used to identify the inter- and intra-relationships between the tasks and subtasks in the abstraction hierarchy. Lastly, a train performance model was developed iteratively by triangulating all of the data collected in the study design. Fig. 2 il- lustrates the overall methodology that was used in the study, and how the various frameworks, data collection, analysis, and visual- isation methods were converged and linked together.  1.1. Aims & objectives  2.2. Data collection process  The main objective of this research was to explore how tradi- tional train driving skill and dynamic was affected by technological advancements in the rail system. The study had three main aims:  1) To establish the complex, dynamic, and opaque features in train driving; 2) To distinguish train driving when it is undertaken traditionally from when it is performed with systems/displays that param- eterise (i.e., enforce) how control is regulated; and 3) To develop a model of train driving performance that broadly captures traditional and modern performance, for further thinking and research.  Early interviews with domain experts, signallers,1 dispatchers (i.e., platform attendants), and guards (i.e., on-board passenger service attendants) were used to understand the task and select probes for train driver interviews. Interview sessions with train drivers typically lasted 90 min, and were coordinated in a dynamic two-part process: (1) participants were asked to describe their routine driving task and break it into 3 to 6 steps; (2) participants  1  Those who interact with the train driver during driving, control train movements are also referred to as dispatchers different states and in different countries.  set signals, and/or and controllers in

An overview of the suite of methods used to collect, analyse and visualise data.  were then presented with a number of driving scenarios and audited for their actions, assessments, and knowledge of demands. The routine driving task was used to establish a hand-drawn task diagram and basic probes were used to direct the scenarios and extract knowledge in the rest of the interview (e.g., Big Picture, Noticing, Improvising, Self-Monitoring, Knowledge, Goals, Aiding). Train driving was also observed via cab rides in the live envi- ronment and in train simulators. Safety passes were required to gain cab entry and granted following a mandatory brieÔ¨Ång of safe in-cab conduct. During the cab ride, participants were asked to: (1) comment on the features of their environment; (2) reason their actions; (3) describe the functions and controls on their interface; and (4) provide a real-time driving commentary. Lastly, digital footage (obtained during phase I) showing the driver POV were observed in addition to the footage recorded during the cab rides. Domain experts were consulted at the end of the process as a means of qualitatively validating the data, and to ensure the reli- ability of the coding and analytical process (e.g., Sauer et al., 2000). Data were captured using digital photography, audio recording equipment and hand written notes. Data in the form of industry documentation were also obtained and included training media, driving rosters, and route diagrams.  2.3. Data analysis  All of the collected data types were examined and organised according to the qualitative taxonomies shown in Fig. 2. Task dia- grams were reviewed and consolidated into a single diagram, and a demands table was assembled and populated. This was used to tag and identify the basic human factors relevant to each scenario type. For example, a signal anomaly scenario included: sustaining atten-  tion (for signal aspect); monitoring (for current train speed); recalling track knowledge (for signal bearing); recalling track knowledge (for navigation); decision-making (for route veriÔ¨Åcation); recognition (of failure mode); reaction time (for brake application); and so on. Driving  scenarios were reÔ¨Åned with concept maps and coded with the inter- and intra-relationships between the tasks and subtasks. For example  develop plan,  implement plan,  a signal reversion concept map included detect, identify, understand, and so on. Data were populated, examined and visualised into an abstraction-decomposition space to show consecutive why-what-how relationships against the sys- tem, function, task, and activities. This process separated the strands of train driving into subtasks, allowing very large and complex data to be organised, represented, and analysed more easily. Study data were also tagged and categorised in a deductive thematic framework with coding units organised under three predeÔ¨Åned categories (dynamism, complexity, and opacity). The data reported in this study were systematically collected and analysed by a single indi- vidual (the author). The Ô¨Åndings from each of the taxonomies were triangulated and crosschecked to derive a basic train-driving model of skilled performance.  2.4.  Participants  The study was advertised in rail organisations across the UK. Data were collected from participants recruited from Ô¨Åve passenger and freight organisations, and at the European Rail TrafÔ¨Åc Man- agement System training centre in Wales. This train centre was trialling modern train driving operations using the ETCS display, and undertaking train driver conversion training with simulators. Signalling data were collected on location from 5 signal boxes (2 Panel-box, 3 Lever Arch). In total, forty-Ô¨Åve participants were interviewed. The age of the sample ranged from 26 to 60 years (M ¬º 39.5, SD ¬º 7.9) and 2% were female (n ¬º 1). The train driver demographic (19 participants) was most relevant to the study, and had over 5 years driving experience (M ¬º 9.3, SD ¬º 6.1). A total of 13 cab rides exceeding 35 h were performed. These were undertaken in 5 passenger trains (urban, regional) and 3 freight locomotives (intermodal), and included 8 full-cab simulator sessions.  2.5.  Ethical  issues  The human ethics and research committee at the University of ShefÔ¨Åeld approved the research in this study. Participation was  
466  A. Naweed / Applied Ergonomics 45 (2014) 462e470  voluntary, study brieÔ¨Ångs were provided, and written consent was obtained. For live Ô¨Åeldwork, requests for dialogue were granted before work activities began, and cleared through attending au- thorities. A Driver Safety Manager accompanied the researcher and driver in all cab rides. Personal details (e.g., job histories) were sought but participants were not (intentionally) pressured to pro- vide them. Participants were informed that they were not required to answer questions that they felt uncomfortable discussing, and sensitive or upsetting topics (e.g., fatalities) were avoided.  3. Results  The results section will initially summarise the outcomes of the task analysis and work domain analysis, using the task diagram and sample data from the abstraction-decomposition space. It will then draw on the thematic analysis and repack these data into a cohesive conceptual model of explanation, developed iteratively over the course of analysis. This will be followed by a discussion of three key themes that emerged out of the Ô¨Åndings. The paper will conclude with directions for future work, including a description of work that has utilised the model.  3.1.  Task diagram  Findings from the task diagram revealed Ô¨Åve steps in the driving process. Fig. 3 consolidates these in a single diagram using ACTA conventions. The Ô¨Årst two were to establish the current location and train state, the third to monitor the external environment, the fourth to anticipate future requirement, and Ô¨Åfth, to control the speed and/or acceleration of the train. Although these steps were depicted in a linear pathway, the Ô¨Årst three were found to occur as a dynamic bi-directional process. This enabled anticipation and prediction of future states, and informed subsequent train control. These Ô¨Åve steps were common to the traditional and modern driving tasks. However, in modern driving, participants down- graded the need to monitor the environment and anticipate future requirement, the former from a loss of external signalling, and the latter, from the way that the movement was parameterised and instructed. This has been conceptualised into Fig. 3 as a shrinking of requirement in steps 3 and 4.  3.2. Abstraction-decomposition space  The results of the analyses in the abstraction-decomposition space extend the differences between modern and traditional driving shown in the task diagram. At the system and function levels, the purpose of train driving fell into two main categories: to (1) provide efÔ¨Åcient passenger and freight services, which was safety and performance-driven, and to (2) maintain the network, which was performance driven only. At the task level, train driving occupied several categories associated with management (e.g., train movement, train and infrastructure failures, delays and dis- ruptions). The functions were abstract (e.g., traction operation, anticipate future requirement), generalised (e.g., monitor infra- structure condition, determine visibility, monitor AWS), and physical (e.g., speed error correction, running brake test, reset AWS  Fig. 3. Consolidated task diagram generated during the formal  interview process.  alarm). The work activities in these tasks were also functional (e.g., maintain driving policies), abstract (e.g., apply defensive driving policy, implement safety measures), generalised (e.g., verify route offering, monitor train progress), and physical (e.g., check time, log event). Similarly, each of these functions relied on tools or infor- mation to inform task management (e.g., code of practice, speed- ometer, trackside signals). Fig. 4 exempliÔ¨Åes two of the pathways in the abstraction-decomposition space generated for (a) traditional driving and (b) modern driving in the managing train movement task category. In the traditional task (Fig. 4a), traction operation was deÔ¨Åned an abstract function of managing train movement. Whilst this was generalised to monitoring movement authority and determining railhead conditions, it manifested as speed error correction. The process was dependent on train speed and signal aspect checking activities, facilitated by the speedometer and trackside signals. A second abstract function of managing train movements was anticipating future requirement, facilitated by route veriÔ¨Åcation activities reliant on route knowledge. The purpose at the system and function levels was to provide efÔ¨Åcient services and safe op- erations, maintained by driving policies through a code of practice and safe working. In the modern task (Fig. 4b) movement authority was monitored and speed-error was corrected, but this occurred via abstract tracking activities in the speed trajectory of the enhanced display. A second abstract function was to verify up- coming features against the information in the display (held in the planning area) and check route expectations, again from display- based information (held in the text message area). Unsurprisingly, the differences in the two pathways shown in Fig. 4 emphasised more in-cab monitoring activities in the modern task, against the external monitoring and searching activities in the traditional task. They also extended the Ô¨Åndings from the task diagram, and showed a focus on activities oriented to verifying upcoming features over anticipating changes. Thus, consultation with the display system and tools in the display, featured very heavily as a generalised and physical function in modern train driving.  3.3. Multi-task model of dynamic train control  The Ô¨Åndings of the task analyses, work analyses, and deductive thematic analyses, were used to develop a multi-task model of dynamic train control (pictured in Fig. 5). As depicted in the model, the data elicited were conceptualised in the tradition of closed-loop feedback (i.e. cyclical processes), much like in other train perfor- mance models (e.g., Hamilton and Clarke, 2005; McLeod et al., 2005; Roth and Multer, 2009). However, the model was also framed using principles from the joint cognitive systems approach (Woods and Hollnagel, 2006), to illustrate how components of human action in the two tasks were continuous and tied together. In the traditional task, the driver-train dynamic relied exclusively on ‚Äòout-the-window‚Äô perception to regulate movement. Information cues were gathered as a part of driver route knowledge (e.g., route proÔ¨Åle, movement authority), and then applied to the conditions as part of train handling expertise (e.g., railhead conditions). These processes were informed by perceptual and haptic response. Thus, the visibility, auditory feedback, drag and coupling forces around the train, allowed the driver to gauge movement authority and regulate control. The overall driver-train dynamic in the traditional task conformed to real-world target tracking. In this dynamic, the driver- train system relied on speciÔ¨Åc knowledge of the cargo (e.g., freight type, passenger volumes), temporary notices (i.e., changes to lines speeds or the route), and the rulebook (i.e., safe working), in order to aggregate and inform their driving strategies. Taken together, this knowledge enabled the driver to optimally manage the dynamic train control process depicted in the task diagram (Fig. 3). This aspect

Means-end relationships of managing train movement in the (a) traditional and (b) modern task represented in multiple dimensions of  functional abstraction.  of dynamic control was reiterated and extended into the model (Fig. 5) as a Ô¨Çuid, bi-directional process. Thus, in the traditional driver-train dynamic, the entire process was regulated based on transparent train state indication, but informed largely by elements that were very opaque to the observer. In the modern task, signal and speed based instruction was shown inside the cab. Upcoming route features were also pre- viewed inside the train, rendering ‚Äòout-the-window‚Äô perception more a requirement for threat or error detection. The speed tra- jectory accounted for changes in the environment, and was typi- cally pre-programmed with aggregates of driving strategy. Thus any speed deviations were corrected by an automated brake application. In the modern driver-train dynamic, the task relied almost entirely on display-based ‚Äòpursuit‚Äô tracking to regulate movement. Thus, while the driver effectively tracked the changing authorities on the display, train control was maintained or opti- mised based on the verisimilitude of the tracking with the antici- pated feedback. The way driving was optimised and maintained was pre-planned through heuristics, so if feedback was anticipated, dynamic train control would be maintained, but if not, speed would be manipulated to optimise the task. The multi-task model  illustrates the differences in the way the driver corresponded with the train and the external environment in the two tasks.  4. Discussion  The principles of dynamic train control found in the study were generally consistent with situation awareness (Endsley, 1995). The multi-task model of dynamic train control that emerged from the Ô¨Åndings was a front-end form for the underlying complexity in the traditional and modern driving tasks. It was also a pragmatic rep- resentation of the underlying theory relevant to the task, and the model conveyed the relative dynamism, complexity, and opacity in the feed-forward and feedback processes of the domain. As with all qualitatively derived models in the substantive literature, it is important to note that the lack of physical form and structure limited its power as a complete model of train driving, though the purpose of modelling the tasks in this study was to illustrate functionality and performance, not structure or internal processes. The next section will extend the results by discussing three key themes that emerged from the Ô¨Åndings. These will draw on the model (Fig. 5) to identify the nature of traditional and modern train

They will also draw on the Ô¨Åndings to (3) speculate how skill may be evolving as a consequence of the ‚Äòmodern‚Äô driver-train dynamic.  4.1.  The complex, dynamic & opaque features of  train driving  Train-driving complexity was deÔ¨Åned by goals of time-accuracy, comfort and effective speed regulation. These goals were common to the modern and traditional tasks. They were coupled together very closely and required trade-offs if punctuality, energy efÔ¨Å- ciency, ride quality and overall safety were to be optimised. The task was also extremely dynamic and trains could move too fast or too slow very easily. Thus, the task incorporated an autonomously driven process on two dimensions: Ô¨Årst, the driver only controlled the throttle (i.e., acceleration-braking of the train), not the speed itself; and second, there was a performance requirement for service delivery imposed at a system level (usually time-based). Whilst the skills in modern and traditional train driving were both opaque, the nature of this opacity was found to differ between the two tasks. In traditional driving, movement authority was sought in the external environment but not always readily observable (i.e., hid- den from immediate view). The prevalence of rail curvature and viewing obstacles (e.g., overhead bridges, trackside vegetation) in UK rail was frequently used to characterise the task. As shown in Branton‚Äôs research (1979), this lack of transparency engendered a  skill for throttle regulation (inferred from train handling experi- ence) and quasi-mathematic computation (inferred from route knowledge), based on the anticipation of future requirements. In comparison, modern train driving increased the transparency of movement authority, but replaced the anticipation of future re- quirements with processes more abstractly aligned with conÔ¨År- mation and expectation of upcoming events. Whilst drivers indicated they were performing anticipatory behaviours, this was related to changes in the display, suggesting that the opacity in the external environment was actually transferred to the cab. Thus, in the modern mode, drivers were verifying their expectation of up- coming events but essentially, driving to the display.  4.2.  Traditional versus modern train driving  The Ô¨Åndings in this study indicated that dynamic train control was conducted in a continuous stream of two time spheres based on where the driver was (establish current state; location) and where they needed to be (monitor environment; anticipate future requirement). This was encapsulated in a process of dynamic train control. These Ô¨Åndings were interpreted into the model using principles of target tracking in human performance engineering psychology. Traditional train driving operated in the analogy of real-world target tracking, and essentially required the driver to keep train speed within prescribed limits by manipulating its ac- celeration. As shown in the model (see Fig. 5), this was achieved  
A. Naweed / Applied Ergonomics 45 (2014) 462e470  469  using standard train state features (e.g., speedometer, brake pres- sure gauges) and overt speed-error correction against movement authority perceived externally (signals, speeds). Thus, the driver ‚Äòtracked‚Äô the speeds in the external environment, accounted for the driving conditions, anticipated future events, and adjusted the throttle/brake to correct the speed of the train. In modern train driving, the driver followed a dynamic in-cab authority that parameterised throttle changes independently of the train itself, and within the conÔ¨Ånes of an explicitly deÔ¨Åned speed envelope. Thus, it operated under a mode consistent with ‚Äòpursuit tracking‚Äô (Wickens and Hollands, 2000), deÔ¨Åned as the requirement to maintain the tracking tool (i.e., speedometer nee- dle) within the threshold of a movement zone that had an upper (max) and lower (min) boundary. As shown in the model, modern train driving relegated all observable movement authority into the enhanced display, and whilst this movement was transparent, the underlying calculations were not. This may explain why the work activities in this mode were more abstractly aligned with expec- tation and veriÔ¨Åcation over anticipation (see Fig. 4). In modern driving, the in-cab authority was ultimate, and the information that traditionally informed driving behaviour (e.g., driving conditions, anticipation of future events, stopping pattern) was absorbed into its algorithms. Much of these Ô¨Åndings implicated that train-driving skill as traditionally recognised was ‚Äúhanded over‚Äù to the system, but they also suggested that in modern driving, train-driving skill equated to how well displays could be pursued, and the decision- making expertise informing this.  4.3.  Relinquishing traditional train driving skill  There is a general perception that modern train driving may ‚Äúdeskill‚Äù train drivers in the rail domain, which needs to be addressed. In this study, these perceptions were commonly held in drivers from a strong tradition of momentum-based driving, together with assertions that the modern task emphasised the time-keeping requirement. Whilst the change in the nature of the driver-train dynamic may have tightened the cybernetic agency of the driver and train system, the automatic speed correction and ‚Äòsupervision‚Äô of a machine system were popular points of conten- tion. The Ô¨Åndings in this study implicated radical differences in traditional and modern train driving in the way drivers corre- sponded with the train, and there was little doubt that the migra- tion of movement authority from the trackside to the cab, and its enforcement through pursuit tracking, changed the nature of the skill. However, it is important to note that the physical function of the task remained the same (see Fig. 4), and whilst participants essentially indicated that they drove to the display, the task of maintaining and optimising speed-error was found to actually require some careful planning and tentative adjustments if train speed were not to be exceeded. In the modern task, train acceleration was regulated within the speed trajectory based on trial and error. This suggested that drivers had adapted to the loss of control (as deÔ¨Åned by traditional train driving) and the changeover by exerting control into a Ô¨Åne and more discrete layer of decision-making (i.e., within the conÔ¨Ånes of a displayed speed trajectory). Thus, the increased transparency of the movement authority may have given way to a subset of tracking activities that fundamentally lacked in transparency. Participants also indicated that in the modern task, train driving was not always parameterised by the systems. Some sections of track (e.g., areas with no system coverage) had to be engaged in the traditional manner (i.e., using external signalling & signage). While this may give rise to new human factors concerns (i.e., from mode switching and maintaining competencies) it may be more accurate to posit that instead of deskilling drivers, the modern task has assimilated a  key element of the original quasi-mathematical skill, but replaced it with a new one. It may also be reasonable to argue that whilst this modern ‚Äòskill‚Äô may have a different perceptual-attentional proÔ¨Åle, it may be as equally quasi-mathematical, though this is an empirical question and would need to be tested. A Ô¨Ånal thought here is that as the algorithms in modern train systems continue to improve and cater for the many input vectors in the task, the role of train driving skill may need to be redeÔ¨Åned. Similarly, if train displays are essentially being driven to, the concept of acquiring and maintaining a priori route knowledge may be redundant. Whilst there is a current requirement for maintain- ing route knowledge in modern train driving (i.e., in degraded running or areas without systems coverage), one may speculate that with increased Ô¨Ådelity, the dynamic with route knowledge will also change. From an engineering systems perspective, the proÔ¨Åle of the modern task also diminishes the requirement for human input. If systems in the modern task have the authority to override train control, the notion of train driving skill and the traditional role of the train driver has arguably already been redeÔ¨Åned.  5.  Future directions  5.1. Applying the multi-task model of dynamic train control  Whilst the Ô¨Åndings in this study were derived from systematic scientiÔ¨Åc research processes, they were based on speculative data. Thus, they incorporated the opinions, prejudices, and nuances of the participants and the hypotheses captured in the model need to be tested. At the start of the discussion, it was noted that the pur- pose of modelling the tasks in this study was to illustrate func- tionality and performance. Given the Ô¨Åndings, the immediate next step was to test the model to explore how modern train driving shaped the train-driving decisions alluded to in Section 4.3. This would help determine the extent of the perceptual-attentional load encapsulated in the modern task. Since this study, the multi-task model of dynamic train control (Fig. 5) and the speciÔ¨Åc features of the domain have been applied to the design and development of a microworld (a generic part-task simulation) of train driving called ATREIDES (Naweed et al., 2013). ATREIDES analogises the way speed is controlled in the traditional and modern train driving using graphical-relational forms (much like those shown in Fig. 1). This paradigm was subsequently used to investigate perceptual- attentional load in the modern task, and the nature of the chang- ing driving skill, thus the qualitative validation work in this paper is backed by empirical data. However, the next step should be to develop the model further, and quantify it, much like other models in the area (e.g., Hamilton and Clarke, 2005). This would strengthen the utility of the multi-task model and help research how the modern task would be affected by changing modalities (e.g., switching back and forth from traditional to modern driving on the same journey), and different error producing conditions.  5.2. Driver-cab display ergonomics  Although in-cab signalling and display-based speed trajectories have increased the transparency of train movement, the outside environment still needs to be searched for threat and error. Clearly, this creates concern over the potential for excess ‚Äòheads down‚Äô ac- tivity. Research has begun examining the feasibility of heads up displays in rail (e.g., Thomas and Davies, 2008), but these are early and grounded in the traditional task. Whilst the research reported in this paper has helped to better understand the impact of the modern train driving, the next step would be to extend these tasks to the heads-up space, and investigate how the driver-train system in the traditional and modern task responds to the change in dynamic.  
470  A. Naweed / Applied Ergonomics 45 (2014) 462e470  5.3.  The wider rail context  Finally, whilst this work may be generalisable to other rail in- dustries, it comprised a UK-based focus on traditional train driving. Though the modern driving parameters were adopted from a ‚ÄòEu- ropean‚Äô perspective, the data informing the modern task may also be skewed towards a UK-based representation of the ETCS system. Whilst the ETCS is supported by design standards, the display is typically customised to the particular needs of the rail network. Although the nature of the driver-train dynamic does not change, more research of train driving skill is advocated to investigate other iterations of the modern task from the wider European and inter- national perspectives.  6.  Conclusions  In conclusion, the main objective of this study was to explore how traditional train driving skill and dynamic was affected by technological advancements in the rail system. It aimed to distin- guish train operation in traditional and modern driving, establish its complex, dynamic, and opaque features, and develop a model that captured performance in the traditional and modern tasks. The study applied an innovative data collection methodology incorpo- rating several analytical and visualisation techniques to elicit knowledge and investigate train driving skill from a multi-task perspective. Both the modern and traditional train-driving tasks were found to possess features that straddled complexity, dyna- mism and opacity on several levels. The Ô¨Åndings showed that though the requirement for speed-error correction essentially remained the same, the driver-train dynamic in the traditional and modern driving tasks was very different. It also revealed that bringing the signals and movement authority into the cab, did not necessary increase the transparency of the task. These Ô¨Åndings were conceptualised in a general multi-task model of dynamic control. The model contributes to other situation and skill-based train driving models through its unique illustration of skill and focus on multiple tasks.

s0003687013001312,"  As technology has become more complex and capable, task operators have increasingly relied on sensor-driven signals to inform them about dangerous conditions and event. Researchers investigating the link between the reliability of automated signaling systems and operator reactions have drawn several con- clusions. Chief among these is the idea that signaling systems producing false alarms inspire lack of trust (termed the ‚ÄúCry-Wolf Effect‚Äù) and that subsequent reactions to such systems may become slower or less frequent (Breznitz, 1984). Initial work by researchers such as Janis (1962) and Breznitz (1984) documented well the degradation of reaction behaviors. Subsequently, other researchers have focused on the characteristics of personal reactions to unre- liable alarms, the variability of alarm reaction behavior associated with competing tasks and personal motivators, and the inÔ¨Çuence of information availability and performance consequences on behav- iors. Such investigations have demonstrated that alarm reaction behavior is a complex phenomenon that is inextricably tied to the target task, signaling equipment, and operator cognition. To broaden the understanding of human reactions to unreliable signals, researchers have relied on existing theories of learning and human cognition. These have included probability matching,  * Corresponding author. Tel.: √æ1 757 683 6976; fax: √æ1 757 683 5087. jbliss@odu.edu, jimbliss2u@gmail.com (J.P. Bliss), echan004@ odu.edu (E.T. Chancey).  E-mail addresses:  where observed alarm responses approximate the perceived true alarm rate (Bliss et al., 1995), Signal Detection Theory, where signal detection and response is more rapid for historically reliable alarm systems (Getty et al., 1995), and automation trust, where exhibited trust corresponds to behavioral patterns of system use and misuse (Parasuraman and Riley, 1997). A clear conclusion is that, regard- less of speciÔ¨Åc task domain, alarm reaction patters are undeniably inÔ¨Çuenced by perceived alarm system reliability. SpeciÔ¨Åc in- vestigations have shown application to domains as diverse as aviation (Pritchett, 2001), surgical theaters (Xiao and Seagull, 1999) and security monitoring (Marra and Playford, 2009). Because of the implications of low alarm reliability, designers and researchers have endeavored to remedy the problem. Designers of signaling systems have focused their efforts on sensor and display technologies such as likelihood alarm displays (Sorkin et al., 1988). This approach to signal design may be used to embed information about anticipated alarm validity within the signal itself. Bustamante (2008) showed the power of this approach. However, the beneÔ¨Åts of likelihood alarm displays are evident only after signals have occurred; furthermore, individual operators frequently exhibit variability in responding, even when signal ur- gency and reliability are unequivocally high (Bliss, 2003). In addition, designed likelihood alarm displays may not be Ô¨Çexible enough to retain effectiveness across operational environments and task situations. The current work is complementary, targeting behavioral change strategies to insulate task operators from signal unreliability.  0003-6870/$ e see front matter √ì 2013 Elsevier Ltd and The Ergonomics Society.

2  2.  Experiment 1  J.P. Bliss, E.T. Chancey / Applied Ergonomics xxx (2013) 1e7  One of the most common strategies advocated for task per- formers to manage signal unreliability is responding to every signal, regardless of its perceived validity. Such a strategy is common in high-consequence task environments such as medi- cine, where failure to acknowledge a valid signal may outweigh the impact of responding to false alarms (Xiao et al., 2004). One issue, however, is that task operators are forced to allocate their attention to stimuli that may not be consequential. This imparts inefÔ¨Åciency in response behavior and may actually lengthen response times in cases where multiple signals occur simulta- neously. A second problem is that over time, operators may react more slowly to all signals, assuming that a certain proportion of them will be false (Getty et al., 1995). Implications such as these illustrate the need for a more discriminative training solution, especially in task environments where false alarms are frequent such as medical care or security monitoring (Xiao et al., 2004; Marra and Playford, 2009). An alternative approach to training is to train operators to recognize and anticipate trends in the underlying data that drive signal annunciation. Such an approach capitalizes on the tendency of operators to rely on redundant sources of information to judge signals (Bliss, 2003). Our Ô¨Årst experiment was intended to provide empirical support for the idea that data pattern training could improve operator reactions. Our approach involved presenting participants with a simulated security monitoring task where periodic signals warned of motion in certain building rooms. Participants were advised about the signaling system‚Äôs reliability before participating and received training to recognize spatial or temporal sensor signal patterns or focus on one sensor. We hypothesized that participants would respond most to high-reliability alarms, regardless of training (Bliss et al., 1995). We also anticipated that participants receiving single- sensor training would respond most often and most appropriately because of that method‚Äôs simplicity. Researchers have not directly compared spatial and temporal training effectiveness; therefore, we made no hypotheses about the relative beneÔ¨Åt of these training conditions.  2.1. Method: experiment 1  2.1.1. Design  For Experiment 1 we employed a 2  4 split-plot design. The within subjects variable was the stated reliability of the alarm system and had two levels: 20% and 40% true alarms. These levels were chosen to reÔ¨Çect the low reliability rates associated with se- curity alarm systems (Sampson, 2002). The between subjects var- iable was alarm reaction training type and had four levels: single sensor training, spatial pattern sensor training, temporal pattern sensor training, and no training (control). Performance based dependent measures for the signaling task included reaction time to the sensors (time taken to click on the acknowledge button after a sensor activated), ‚Äúrespond‚Äù and ‚Äúignore‚Äù rates for the alarm signals (proportion alarms to which participants clicked on the ‚Äúrespond‚Äù or ‚Äúignore‚Äù buttons) and re- action time for alarm reaction behaviors (‚Äúrespond‚Äù or ‚Äúignore). A running alarm score reÔ¨Çected the number of times participants correctly responded to and ignored alarms. If a correct choice was made (responding to a true alarm or ignoring a false alarm), 1.5 points were added to the score; the same number was deducted from the score after each incorrect choice (ignoring a true alarm or responding to a false alarm). The score was presented visually to the participants during the task. Correct choices were accompanied auditorily with a female voice saying ‚ÄúCorrect.‚Äù Incorrect choices  facilitated  were accompanied by ‚ÄúIncorrect.‚Äù These components participant decision-making during the task. Subjective trust ratings for the alarm systems were also recor- ded, using Jian, Bisantz, and Drury‚Äôs subjective trust questionnaire. Word search primary task performance was also recorded as the number of words identiÔ¨Åed during each experimental session. Word search was required as a loading task to more realistically simulate dual-task signal monitoring conditions. No statistically signiÔ¨Åcant differences were noted for this variable, indicating similar primary task loading across groups and conditions.  2.1.2.  Participants  Eighty undergraduate students enrolled in psychology courses at Old Dominion University in Norfolk, Virginia, were tested. The mean age of the sample was 23.3 (SD ¬º 2.25). The sample consisted of 17 males and 63 females. No participant indicated hearing loss or color deÔ¨Åciency. Participants were awarded course credit for participating in the 2-h experiment. A $20 performance incentive was also offered to the participant with the highest combined primary and secondary task score.  2.1.3. Materials  The alarm task was modeled after a building security- monitoring scenario (see Fig. 1). Participants viewed a building schematic that contained motion sensors in selected rooms. Par- ticipants acknowledged every sensor signal (red light in a room and a 1000-Hz. tone) by clicking on the ‚ÄúACK‚Äù icon. An alarm signal followed Ô¨Åve prior sensor signal activations. The alarm signal was a red area containing the word ‚ÄúINTRUDER!‚Äù at the bottom of the screen and a Ô¨Åre bell from a Boeing 757. Participants could react to an alarm by selecting between two icons, ‚ÄúRESPOND‚Äù (true alarm) or ‚ÄúIGNORE‚Äù (false alarm). As noted above, correct reactions depended on prior sensor activations. Referring to Fig. 1 below, single sensor training involved focusing on a single sensor (highlighted in red) to determine the validity of the subsequent alarm. Participants in this group were told that if the sensor activated at any time before the subsequent alarm signal, the alarm would be true. Spatial pattern training required detection of a clockwise sensor activation pattern to judge subsequent alarm validity. Participants were told to note the spatial pattern of sensors that activated prior to an alarm signal. If the pattern was clockwise, this indicated that the alarm signal would be true. Temporal pattern training required detection of a short sensorealarm time interval to judge alarm validity. Participants in  Fig. 1. The Sensor and Alarm Reaction Task.

J.P. Bliss, E.T. Chancey / Applied Ergonomics xxx (2013) 1e7  3  this group were told to judge whether the time interval between sensor activations was becoming longer or shorter. If it was becoming successively shorter, this indicated that the subsequent alarm signal was true. Participants in the no-training control group were not provided any information about the sensors. They were told to judge alarm validity based on the reliability information provided before the session began. Importantly, the actual validity of individual alarms and overall reliability of the alarm system was maintained within sessions; true and false alarms were presented to match the sensor activation behavior for each group and re- Ô¨Çected the stated reliability of the alarm system (20% or 40%). Therefore, following training should have led to appropriate re- actions in all cases. The sensor activations and alarm activations were the same for every group; the only difference was the training participants received. Control participants received no training to help them discriminate true from false alarms. In all cases, the correct reaction was to respond to true alarms and ignore false alarms. Two word searches from http://www.puzzle-club.com were used as a primary task during each experimental session. No word bank was available. Participants completed an 11-item human-computer trust questionnaire (Jian et al., 2000). The survey demonstrated high internal consistency, aCronbach ¬º .95.  2.1.4.  Procedure  The precise schedule of activity is included in Table 1. Upon arrival participants received and signed an informed consent form and Ô¨Ålled out a Background Questionnaire. Prior to the experi- mental sessions participants were randomly assigned to a training group (single sensor, spatial, temporal, or no training) and were provided instructions for the word search and alarm reaction tasks. After a general overview of the experimental procedure partici- pants received speciÔ¨Åc sensor reaction training based on their training group. All participants then completed a short quiz to demonstrate their understanding of sensor reactions. Participants were required to score a 70% on the quiz to proceed to the exper- imental session. If the participant was unable to reach this cutoff then they were retrained until they understood the task.  2.1.5.  Task  Participants then completed two experimental sessions, inter- acting with a 20% reliable alarm system and a 40% reliable alarm system (counterbalanced). Prior to each session participants were told the reliability of the signaling system. They used reliability and their training to help them decide which alarms to respond to and which to ignore. Participants completed a word search task while reacting to sensors and alarms. Upon receiving alarms, participants could respond to send a simulated security team to investigate a building security breach. Responding or ignoring carried simulated consequences of misdirected resources or the theft of valuables;  Table 1 Schedule of activity for experimental participants.

During each session there were Ô¨Åve sensor activations followed by an alarm; this sequence repeated Ô¨Åve times (total of 25 sensor activations and 5 alarms during each session). Alarm validity matched the stated reliabilities; the 20% reliability session included one true alarm and four false alarms; the 40% reliability session included two true alarms and three false alarms. Following each experimental session participants completed the human-computer trust questionnaire. After completing an experimental session for each reliability level, participants were debriefed and dismissed.  2.2.  Results: experiment 1  The data were inspected to ensure normality and that each group had equal numbers and no outliers. Multiple 2 (reliability)  4 (training) split-plot Analyses of Variance (ANOVAs) were used to identify differences. An alpha level of p < .05 was established to indicate statistical signiÔ¨Åcance. An ANOVA revealed no signiÔ¨Åcant main effects or interactions for primary task perfor- mance (percentage of word search items found per session) (p > .05). An ANOVA revealed a main effect of reliability on sensor reac- tion time, F(1, 76) ¬º 8.80, p ¬º .004, partial h2 ¬º .104. However, a signiÔ¨Åcant interaction between reliability and training type was observed, F(3, 76) ¬º 2.89, p ¬º .041, partial h2 ¬º .102, which indicated a more pronounced decrease in sensor reaction time for the control and temporal groups than for the single sensor and the spatial pattern groups. No main effect of training type on sensor reaction time was observed, F(3, 76) ¬º 1.06, p > .05 (See Fig. 2). An ANOVA showed no signiÔ¨Åcant interaction of reliability and training type on alarm reaction time, F(3, 76) ¬º 1.99, p > .05. There were also no observable main effects for reliability, F(1, 76) ¬º .73, p > .05, or training group, F(3, 76) ¬º .90, p > .05, on alarm reaction time. There was a signiÔ¨Åcant main effect of training on alarm response rate, F(3, 76) ¬º 3.11, p ¬º .031, partial h2 ¬º .109. Follow-up Tukey tests did not indicate signiÔ¨Åcant differences among the training groups. However, participants in the spatial pattern training group responded less often than those in the control group (p ¬º .071) (see Fig. 2). There was no observable main effect of reliability on alarm response rate, F(1, 76) ¬º 1.37, p > .05. There was also no interaction between reliability and training group, F(3, 76) ¬º 1.58, p > .05. An ANOVA revealed a signiÔ¨Åcant main effect of training on alarm score, F(3, 76) ¬º 7.87, p < .001, partial h2 ¬º .237. Follow-up Tukey tests indicated that participants in the single sensor and spatial training groups reacted more appropriately than those in the control group (p ¬º .003 and .001, respectively, see Fig. 2). No main effect of reliability was observed for alarm score, F(1, 76) ¬º .35, p > .05. There was also no interaction between reliability and training group, F(3, 76) ¬º .61, p > .05. A Ô¨Ånal ANOVA revealed a signiÔ¨Åcant main effect of training on subjective trust in the alarm system, F(3, 76) ¬º 5.42, p ¬º .002, partial h2 ¬º .176 (see Fig. 2). Follow-up Tukey tests showed that partici- pants without training indicated signiÔ¨Åcantly less trust than those in the spatial pattern training group (p ¬º .002). Participants in the single sensor training group also indicated less trust in the alarm system than those with spatial pattern training (p ¬º .032). A main effect of subjective trust in the alarm system approaching signiÔ¨Å- cance was observed for reliability, F(1, 76) ¬º 2.96, p ¬º .090, partial .037, where participants in the 20% reliability group (M ¬º 48.15, SE ¬º 1.77) trusted the alarm system less than the 40% reliability group (M ¬º 51.23, SE ¬º 1.71).

Average sensor reaction time (secs), alarm response rate (proportion), alarm reaction score, and subjective alarm system trust as a function of alarm reliability and training group.  2.3. Discussion: experiment 1  The results suggest that alarm score and subject trust were particularly sensitive metrics of training success. Participants in the spatial training group scored higher and manifested greater trust than control participants. Those in the single sensor group out- scored control participants but did not trust the alarm system as much as those in the spatial group. In addition to conÔ¨Årming the success of our training materials, the results validated the mea- surement of performance by way of a derived score. We expected faster reaction times to reliable sensors based on past research (Getty et al., 1995); however, our Ô¨Åndings illustrated difÔ¨Åculty of estimating temporal intervals and of performing with no training. Indeed, those groups reduced their sensor reaction times considerably, suggesting they may have learned most over the course of the experiment. The challenges faced by these par- ticipants may have caused control and temporal group participants to rely more on stated historical reliability levels during the experiment. Whereas sensor reaction time proved sensitive to reliability, alarm reaction time was surprisingly less sensitive. Given the  complexity of the tasks required, participants may have made re- action decisions prior to the experimental session. This tendency has been discussed in prior research (Bliss et al., 1995). From prior research, we had expected response rate to be a sensitive index of trust. However, the group differences we observed were not signiÔ¨Åcant. It is admittedly difÔ¨Åcult to interpret these Ô¨Åndings because participants were trained to react appro- priately, not necessarily to respond more often. Perhaps most compelling was the relative difÔ¨Åculty of temporal training. In real-world task situations, it is frequently important for task operators to judge the time interval between pre-alarm signals (‚Äúattensons‚Äù; see Patterson, 1980) and subsequent alarms. For this reason, we chose to focus our effort on temporal training in the second experiment, reported below.  3.  Experiment 2  An important conclusion from Experiment 1 was the challenge faced by participants in the temporal training group. As in real- world process monitoring (Papadopoulos and McDermid, 2001), participants were asked to infer alarm validity based on the elapsed  Please cite this article in press as: Bliss, J.P., Chancey, E.T., An investigation of training strategies to improve alarm reactions, Applied Ergonomics (2013), http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2013.06.007

As noted by Vercruyssen et al. (1989), doing so is critical for many occupations, including emergency responders. Time estimation is an important skill underlying signal re- sponses. Accident databases are rife with situations in which task operators failed to note lapses in signal occurrence, or failed to recognize that signals were occurring more frequently over time. One poignant example is the 1995 grounding of a Panamanian cruise ship, the Royal Majesty, after the automated navigation sys- tem malfunctioned and the crew failed to notice absence of alerts across time (National Transportation Safety Board, 1997). Training time estimation has been attempted by other re- searchers, notably Brown (2008). Brown showed that performance feedback could improve time interval estimation skills in a dual- task paradigm. To facilitate interval recognition, music teachers often employ the Takadimi method, using beat subdivision to illustrate and reinforce tempo maintenance (Houlahan and Tacka, 2008). The results of Experiment 1 demonstrated that training could lead participants to recognize patterns in underlying data. How- ever, participants struggled to infer alarm validity from temporal sensorealarm intervals. For the second experiment, we planned a follow-on investigation to compare methods for training temporal interval estimation skills. Using a similar research paradigm as in Experiment 1, we compared subdivision training and feedback training to a no-training control group. We expected that trained participants would react most appropriately to true and false alarms. We also expected participants with additional subdivision training to react more appropriately to alarms than those trained using feedback alone. Last, we expected that participants would react more appropriately to signals from a high-reliability system.  3.1. Method: experiment 2  3.1.1. Design  For Experiment 2 we employed a 2  3 split-plot design. Similar to Experiment 1, the within subjects variable was the stated reli- ability of the alarm system: 20% reliable and 40% reliable. The between-subjects variable was temporal interval training method, with three levels. In training with feedback, participants received feedback about the accuracy of interval approximation during training. In training with feedback and subdivision, participants received feedback and an auditory subdivision aid every 5 s during training. In the control condition, participants received no feedback and no subdivision aid. The dependent measures for the alarm task were the same as those measured in Experiment 1. Temporal deviation scores (secs above or below) were also recorded before and after the pre-alarm task temporal training session in which 30, 60, 75, and 90- s intervals were estimated.  3.1.2.  Participants  We tested Ô¨Åfty-six undergraduate students (21 males, 35 fe- males) enrolled in psychology courses at Old Dominion University in Norfolk, Virginia. The mean age of the sample was 22.56 (SD ¬º 4.72). Participants were awarded course credit for partici- pating. A $20 performance incentive was also offered to the participant with the highest primary and secondary (alarm score) task score.  3.1.3. Materials  The alarm task was similar to Experiment 1, except for the number of sensors and alarms presented and the pattern in which they occurred. Before interacting with the alarm task, participants  underwent extensive temporal training. Participants were asked to estimate random 30, 45, 60, 75, and 90-s intervals by pressing a mouse key after the set time had elapsed. Participants with feed- back training received an indication of their estimate accuracy (above or below) in seconds. Participants with feedback and tem- poral subdivision aid received a 1500 hz. tone every 5 s in addition to feedback. Participants in the control group completed training sessions without feedback or subdivision. To simulate realistic monitoring and primary task loading, participants completed word search puzzles as the primary task, retrieved from http://www. puzzle-club.com. As in Experiment 1, there were no statistically signiÔ¨Åcant differences in primary task performance between groups or conditions. Participants completed the subjective trust questionnaire as in Experiment 1.  3.1.4.  Procedure  The precise schedule of activity is indicated in Table 2. Upon arrival participants provided informed consent and completed the Background Questionnaire. Participants were then randomly assigned to a training group and were given instructions for the word search and alarm reaction tasks. After a general overview of the experimental procedure participants received speciÔ¨Åc sensor reaction training based on their training group. All participants completed a pretest of time estimation, Ô¨Åve training sessions, and a posttest of time estimation accuracy. The training tasks lasted 1 h. Participants next completed two experimental sessions, inter- acting with counterbalanced 20% reliable and 40% reliable alarm systems. Participants knew the reliabilities prior to participating. The alarm response task, including sensor acknowledgments, alarm reactions, and simulated and score consequences, were identical to Experiment 1 (see Fig. 1). In addition to the stated reliability, par- ticipants were also told a sensorealarm time interval of less than 60 s indicated a true alarm; one of more than 60 s indicated a false alarm. Participants were to react to true alarms by selecting the ‚ÄúRESPOND‚Äù icon, and to react to false alarms by selecting ‚ÄúIGNORE.‚Äù There were 10 sensor activations, each followed by an alarm. The ten alarms in each session were matched to the stated reliability (two of the ten were true in the 20% reliability condition; four of the ten were true in the 40% reliability condition). Participants were required to complete a word search task while reacting to alarms. Following each experimental session participants completed the human-computer trust questionnaire. They were then debriefed and dismissed.  3.2.  Results: experiment 2  The data were inspected to ensure that each group had approximately equal numbers and that data were distributed nor- mally.

Discussion: experiment 2  Brown (2008) has suggested that intervals in the minute range may be too lengthy for participants to learn well. Therefore, we made sure to provide participants with repeated training sessions. Our failure to Ô¨Ånd an effect of temporal interval training on sensor and alarm reaction data was therefore perplexing. Though the in- terval used was ecologically valid, it may have exceeded the memory abilities of the participants tested. A second related explanation is that our dual-task experimental setup may have placed excessive demands on the participants‚Äô working memories. Neurological research has suggested that the prefrontal cortex is used to reproduce and discriminate lengthy temporal intervals (Lalonde and Hannequin, 1999) and that subvocalization is instru- mental for interval judgment (Gruber et al., 2000). Therefore, our use of subdivision training should have improved temporal discrimination. However, Pouthas and Perbal (2004) emphasize the importance of memory and attention for accurate time perception, so it is possible that participants were unable to beneÔ¨Åt from training because of competing cognitive task demands. Another possible explanation for the inadequacy of training might be lack of motivation on the part of the participants. We attempted to increase motivation by instituting a monetary incentive; however, it is possible that participants were still not sufÔ¨Åciently motivated. Further research should involve trained task operators and a more realistic task. We did Ô¨Ånd it encouraging that participants differentiated be- tween reliability levels. One interesting aspect is that they appar- ently paid greater attention to a single advertisement of reliability than to temporal intervals (reinforced by anecdotal comments from participants). This Ô¨Ånding echoes past results showing that par- ticipants seem to generate reaction strategies heuristically, prior to interacting with the system.  4. General discussion and conclusions  Environmental design often constrains the potential for opti- mizing physical sensor and alarm signals. The results discussed here provide some guidance about how operators may be trained to ensure that signal reactions are timely and appropriate. From Experiment 1, it is clear that training operators to focus on under- lying data may increase reaction appropriateness. However, the results of Experiment 2 provide a caveat: the selected data source matters. Though individual alarm validity may be predictable from recent precursory signals, training participants to discriminate time passage for this purpose holds little promise, especially when op- erators are cognitively loaded. In the medical Ô¨Åeld, some pulse oximetry monitors have been designed with a time-delay that re- duces false alarm occurrence, without sacriÔ¨Åcing the actionable alarms responded to by medical staff (Welch, 2011). To this point, it may be more feasible to circumvent human performance issues with time estimation by ofÔ¨Çoading this to the alarm system itself. Technological innovation has resulted in abundant source data. For example, medical personnel now have access to a plethora of real-time data regarding patient health. As a result, it may be increasingly difÔ¨Åcult to scrutinize individual data sources to determine alarm validity. The data presented here represent initial guidance for such situations. When training reaction decisions,  focusing on one data source is predictable to processing a group of data sources. Doing so may yield beneÔ¨Åts in terms of reaction speed and appropriateness. Also revealing is the tendency of participants to make reaction decisions on the basis of available data, perhaps before experi- encing individual signals themselves. Such a strategy may insulate task operators from excessive workload levels. If so, making a priori reaction decisions is one more example of how vulnerable task operators are to increased levels of workload. For that reason, alarm designers and trainers should be careful to advocate solutions and guidance that add no new workload or attention requirements.  "
s0003687013001324,"  Manual material handling (MMH) involves considerable phys- ical work demands and is considered a high-risk task for low back pain (LBP) (Hoogendoorn et al., 1999; Kuiper et al., 1999; L√∂tters et al., 2003; National Research Council, 2001; da Costa et al., 2010; Nelson and Hughes, 2009). Large spine loading sustained during MMH is a potential cause of low back pain (National Research Council, 2001). The risk increases with the magnitude of the physical exposure in terms of the load moment, trunk motion dynamics and trunk posture (Marras et al., 1993, 1995, 2000). There exists a large variability in low back loading and lifting posture that could be explained by individual differences (between subjects) and by trial-to-trial variations (Granata et al., 1999; van Dieen  * Corresponding author. Tel.: √æ1 514 288 1551; fax: √æ1 514 288 6097. E-mail address: plamondon.andre@irsst.qc.ca (A. Plamondon). URL: http://www.irsst.qc.ca  et al., 2001; Gagnon et al., 2002). Thus, for the same task, spine loading and posture can change markedly between trials and in- dividuals. The study of different groups of workers (experts and novices) could help to reduce this variability and to develop new principles of good manual handling to decrease physical exposure. Various intervention strategies, such as training employees in safe lifting techniques, are used with the aim of protecting workers from back injuries. Recent reviews have seriously questioned the effectiveness of training programs as a mean of reducing back in- juries (Clemes et al., 2010; Demoulin et al., 2012; Haslam et al., 2007; Martimo et al., 2007, 2008; Robson et al., 2012; Verbeek et al., 2011). However, these reviews are based on a small number of studies, and the quality of the training intervention is generally not questioned. Important aspects such as the content of the training course, its duration and its speciÔ¨Åcity to the work context are worth consideration. Kroemer (1992) asked a simple question about training, namely ‚ÄúWhat to teach?‚Äù This question still needs to be answered. For instance, Demoulin et al. (2012) indicated that training content was not consistent among studies and that the  0003-6870/$ e see front matter √ì 2013 Elsevier Ltd and The Ergonomics Society.

472  A. Plamondon et al.  / Applied Ergonomics 45 (2014) 471e481  training was generally given over a very short time; as a result, the ‚Äútraining‚Äù was more like an information session. When training is speciÔ¨Åc to the task and dispensed over a long time, a decrease in back loading is possible (Schibye et al., 2003), which could lead to fewer back injuries. From our point of view, current knowledge is not sufÔ¨Åcient, and it is far from clear whether or not lifting training programs achieve the goal of reducing back injuries by teaching better lifting techniques. Further research is needed to determine the training needs (content) of different subject groups (Demoulin et al., 2012) and the value of training in reducing back injuries. In the search for the best technique for training workers, different types of studies have been conducted. A Ô¨Årst type of study is to instruct participants (generally novice workers) about the technique they should use during MMH, and to measure the effect. These studies have demonstrated the importance of technique in decreasing the horizontal distance between the L5/S1 joint and the load lifted in order to reduce the external back moment (Faber et al., 2009b, 2011; Kingma et al., 2004, 2006, 2010). A second type is to copy the technique used by expert (or experienced) workers. Er- gonomic studies (Authier et al., 1995, 1996) have shown that expert workers use techniquesddifferent from those of novicesdthat could be both safe and advantageous in terms of productivity, but their impact on back loading has not been assessed. Some studies have explored the experts‚Äô techniques such as foot movements, knee bending, the width of the base of support, lifting dynamics, and box lifting and tilting strategies (Delisle et al., 1996a,b, 1998, 1999; Gagnon, 2003). These studies have conÔ¨Årmed the value of these techniques in reducing back loading during the handling operation. A third type of studies have been interested in determining the difference between experienced (or expert) and novice workers (Gagnon et al., 1996; Granata et al., 1999; Marras et al., 2006; Plamondon et al., 2010; Lee and Nussbaum, 2012, 2013) with the aim of applying experts‚Äô techniques to reduce back loading among novice workers. In one study (Gagnon et al., 1996), the most marked distinction was reduced knee Ô¨Çexion in experts, but the external back moments were not signiÔ¨Åcantly different. Another study (Granata et al., 1999) showed that experienced workers underwent surprisingly greater and more variable lumbar loading (external moments and internal forces) than novice subjects. Conversely, Marras et al. (2006) showed that internal loading was greater for inexperienced subjects than experienced lifters over the course of an 8-hour workday and that biomechanical risk is greatly reduced with experience. Plamondon et al. (2010) found, during a low lifting task from a conveyor to a hand trolley, that although external peak L5/S1 moments were similar, the lifting posture of experts differed from novice workers, with the experts bending their lumbar spine less but bending their knees more. Recently, Lee and Nussbaum. (2012) indicated that experienced workers used lifting/lowering methods with signiÔ¨Åcantly higher peak lumbar extensor accelera- tions and lumbar moments. Peak Ô¨Çexion/extension angles and ve- locities were also higher (not signiÔ¨Åcantly) among experienced workers, putting them at higher risk of back disorders. On the other hand, Lee and Nussbaum (2013) in a subsequent paper suggested that the higher torso kinematics and kinetics observed among their experienced workers had the advantage of keeping them in better balance and giving them more torso movement stability compared to the novices. There is not yet a clear understanding of the advantages/dis- advantages of using expert techniques to train workers with the aim of reducing back loading and back injuries. A possible reason why there are such differences between studies could be that the deÔ¨Ånition of an expert in MMH is not known. How do we classify a worker as an expert? Years of experience is often used to identify people as experts (Farrington-Darby and Wilson, 2006) but is it the  only valid criterion? Authier et al. (1993) suggested other criteria such as the recognition of co-workers and few lifetime back injuries. Moreover, what about the selection of novice workers? Their level of skill can vary widely, from ‚Äúnaivette‚Äù (one who is completely ignorant about a domain) to ‚Äúapprentice‚Äù (one who is learning about a domain) (Farrington-Darby and Wilson, 2006). As suggested by Lee and Nussbaum (2012), more studies are needed to assess the utility of training based on the techniques of experienced (expert) workers. The choice of task and its difÔ¨Åculty are also critical since expertise is likely task-speciÔ¨Åc. Faber et al. (2011) showed that a typical laboratory simulated lifting task as opposed to a more realistic one could give different results. In addition, according to Farrington-Darby and Wilson (2006), tasks that are unfamiliar or so simple that the experts cannot use any of their speciÔ¨Åc skills or too difÔ¨Åcult for novices are potential sources for misleading Ô¨Åndings. The degree to which the task is meaningful, challenging and familiar contributes to task realism (Farrington-Darby and Wilson, 2006). The study of Plamondon et al. (2010) presented the results of a speciÔ¨Åc task that was not very strenuous: transferring boxes from a conveyor to a hand trolley, with frequent rest periods to prevent fatigue. The present study aimed to investigate if a more chal- lenging task of multiple depalletizingepalletizing, bringing fatigue into play, would make experienced workers‚Äô strategies differ more clearly from those of novices. In this challenging task, the workers had to continuously transfer 24 15-kg boxes Ô¨Åve times from one pallet (depalletizing) to another (palletizing) at two different lifting frequencies: self-paced and imposed pace (9 lifts/min). Only a few studies (Davis et al., 1998; Marras et al., 1997, 1999; Jorgensen et al., 2005) have addressed either the depalletizing or the palletizing task without restricting their workers. The objective of the present study was to verify whether multiple box transfers leading to fa- tigue would also lead to differences between expert and novice workers in joint motions and back loading variables (L5/S1 mo- ments). A secondary aim was to evaluate the effect of box height and distance on back loading during the repetitive depalletizing- palletizing task. This research is original as both the subjects (ex- perts vs novices) and the repetitive nature of the task have rarely been studied.  2. Method  The study was divided into three experimental sessions. The Ô¨Årst was a session during which the subjects were familiarized with the different experimental procedures and some physical capacity parameters (strength and endurance) were measured. The second session speciÔ¨Åcally studied the continuous transfer of boxes from one pallet to another, which is the subject of the present paper. The third session consisted in studying the effect of expertise during transfer of a box from a conveyor to a hand trolley as published earlier (Plamondon et al., 2010). Most of the sections below, except for the task description, present (with some new elements) the main steps in the method used, which has already been described in detail (Plamondon et al., 2010).  2.1.  Subjects  Two groups of male subjects were recruited. The Ô¨Årst group consisted of 15 expert workers who met the following three criteria: a minimum of 5 years of experience; a low lifetime incidence of injuries (particularly to the back); and no injury in the year pre- ceding the study. A fourth criterion, in which the expert has to be recommended by either his peers, the union or management (Farrington-Darby and Wilson, 2006), was included but it was not possible to check its application. Ten experts were recruited from  
A. Plamondon et al.  / Applied Ergonomics 45 (2014) 471e481  473  two distribution centers, where their work consisted in picking products from the ‚Äúpick slot‚Äù by hand and moving the order for redistribution to retailers or wholesalers. The other Ô¨Åve experts worked in stores, where they had to receive the products on a pallet and place them in the store racks. All experts were familiar with the task investigated in the present study. The second group consisted of 15 novice workers meeting the following criteria: 3e6 months of handling experience and no incidence of injury in the year pre- ceding the study. This group can be classiÔ¨Åed between the level of ‚Äúnovice‚Äù (someone having very little exposure to the domain) and ‚Äúapprentice‚Äù (someone who is learning) (Hoffman et al., 1995, re- ported in Farrington-Darby and Wilson, 2006). None of the subjects (experts and novices) had musculoskeletal problems that could affect the normal performance of their work. Ten expert workers and three novices had taken a training program during their working life, while the others had not. The training program (for most of them) consisted of a three-hour session on back injury prevention and safe lifting. Table 1 presents the subjects‚Äô main anthropometric characteristics. The two groups of subjects, namely experts and novices, were not signiÔ¨Åcantly different (t test; p > 0.05) with regard to weight, height and strength. These latter variables should therefore have no impact on the different biomechanical parameters. It should be noted that the two groups were signiÔ¨Å- cantly different with regard to experience (experts ranged from 6.5 to 33 years; novices from 1 month to 1.5 yr) and, incidentally, age. All participants completed the informed consent forms approved by the Ethics Committee of the University of Sherbrooke (Faculty of Medicine and Health Science). The subjects were allowed at least one day of rest between sessions, and the three sessions were generally completed in less than 10 days.  2.2.  Task description  The MMH task consisted in transferring 24 15-kg boxes from one pallet (depalletizing) to another (palletizing), and back, Ô¨Åve times over a period of 30 min (total box transfers: 240). The height of each pallet was 16 cm and the box dimensions were 26 cm deep by 35 cm wide by 32 cm high. The subjects were instructed to remain on the force platform (Fig. 1) and to pile the boxes (total of 24) in a column stacking pattern 4 layers high (1st layer ¬º 16 cm above the Ô¨Çoor, 2nd ¬º 48 cm, 3rd ¬º 80 cm; 4th ¬º 112 cm) by 6 boxes/layer (3 in the front row, 3 in the back row). The Ô¨Åve-trip sequence was divided into two parts: the Ô¨Årst consisted of two round trips for all 24 boxes on the pallet (total of 96 boxes handled), performed at a rhythm the subject would use in an eight-hour day for this type of manual handling (self-paced). The second part (imposed pace) consisted of three round trips for all 24 boxes (total of 144 boxes) at a nine-box-per-minute rhythm (Garg and Saxena, 1979) to increase challenge and potentially fatigue.

The goal was to make the job harder than at regular speed, with the inten- ded purpose of forcing the experts to demonstrate their skills. The complete description of the MMH task is as follows: at the signal of the experimenter, the worker started the depalletizing task (or lifting phase) by grasping the Ô¨Årst box at the front of the top row. In an upright position and usually facing the pallet, he then lifted the box in his own way and made a 90 turn with a step. The step strategies to transit to the destination pallet varied from one worker to the next (turn, pivot, forward step(s), backward step) but generally ended with the worker facing the destination pallet in an upright position. The worker performed the palletizing task (or deposit phase) by lowering and dropping the box on the pallet and moving it to its Ô¨Ånal destination. The worker continued the transfer at his self-paced until all the boxes were moved to the destination pallet. Once Ô¨Ånished, he immediately started to move them back to the Ô¨Årst pallet, then repeated this until two round trips were completed. The choice of which box to lift (in the depalletizing task) and its destination position (in the palletizing task) was left up to the worker. As shown in Table 2, close to 80% of the boxes were moved from the top of the origin pallet to the bottom of the destination pallet and vice versa. Also the majority of the front boxes in the depalletizing task were transferred to a back location in the palletizing task. The transfer of boxes at the imposed pace was similar to the self-paced task with the exception that (1) the pace was controlled, with the subjects regularly informed if they were too fast or too slow, and (2) three round trips were made. Workers‚Äô localized muscular fatigue was evaluated several times during the experiment with a standardized isometric sub-maximal task where surface electromyography (EMG) was used. The sub- maximal tasks (EMG tests) consisted in holding the trunk in a  Table 2 Transfer directions (Height: 1 ¬º 16 cm; 2 ¬º 48 cm; 3 ¬º 80 cm; 4 ¬º 112 cm) from the depalletizing task (lifting) to the palletizing task (deposit).

In addition, the subject‚Äôs perception of overall physical fatigue and of back muscle fatigue was assessed with a CR-10 Borg‚Äôs scale (Borg, 1982).  2.3. Measuring systems  Two photogrammetric measuring systems were used to record the 3D coordinates of the clusters of markers attached to the pri- mary body segments. The Ô¨Årst system consisted of infrared LED diodes whose signals were collected by four ‚ÄòOptotrak‚Äô columns (Northern Digital Inc., Waterloo, Ontario, Canada). Since this system did not generate video images, a second system consisting of three video cameras allowed veriÔ¨Åcation of the Optotrak system‚Äôs data, correction of some missing data (because of occlusions), and er- gonomic observation of the handling tasks. The external forces on the feet during the handling tasks were obtained by means of an in- house-designed force platform (1.90 m  1.30 m) mounted on six AMTI mini platforms (model MC3A-6e1000; Advanced Mechanical Technology Inc., Watertown, MA, USA). A Horita, FP-50 system (Mission Viejo, CA, USA) was used to synchronize all of the measuring instruments (Optotrak, video cameras and force platform). Fatigue was estimated by means of EMG (localized back muscle fatigue), heart rate and Borg‚Äôs scale (perception of local and overall fatigue). EMG was recorded at 1024 Hz with two pre-ampliÔ¨Åed electrodes (gain: 1000, model DE-2.3, Delsys, Boston, MA) placed bilaterally over the longissimus muscles (3 cm lateral to L3). Heart rate (HR) was monitored with a Polar system (model RS800; www. polar.Ô¨Å),  2.4.  Experimental procedure  At the beginning of the experiment, the workers were dressed appropriately to put on the EMG electrodes and HR bracelet and to install the clusters of markers. Before the start of each experimental session, the participants were instructed about the importance of reproducing the technique they normally used in their work. It was stressed to the experts that they were teachers and that the authors wanted to learn from their expertise. It was emphasized that the only way to learn from them was for them to reproduce the tech- nique they normally used at work. During all three sessions, no lifting technique was ever prescribed to the participants and no comments were given about the technique they used. The experimental session started with the Ô¨Årst sub-maximal isometric task (EMG Pre-test). Then, the worker was asked to perform the self-paced transfer of boxes (two round trips). Right after completing the self-paced task, the subject did a second sub- maximal isometric task (EMG Post-test 1) and performed a Borg‚Äôs assessment (#1) of his overall physical fatigue and back muscle fatigue. This was immediately followed by the imposed-pace task of 9 lifts/min. The rest time between the end of the self-paced and the start of the imposed-pace transfer did not exceed 5 min. This rest was minimized to prevent the workers from cooling down and to measure the effect of cumulative fatigue at the end of the entire sequence. After the last three round trips, the worker did a third sub-maximal isometric task (EMG Post-test 2) and performed his last Borg‚Äôs assessment (#2) of his overall fatigue and back muscle fatigue.  2.5. Data collection and analysis  The participants were instrumented for use of a dynamic 3D linked-segment model to estimate the net moments at L5/S1. This model calculates the net moments on the basis of external forces,  the kinematics of body segments, and anthropometric data. It re- quires the attachment of 12 rigid clusters of markers to each of the following segments: head (1); back at C7 (1); T12 (1) and S1 (1); both arms (2); both forearms (2); both thighs (2); and both feet (2). The segment parameters were estimated by means of Jensen‚Äôs elliptical method (1978). External forces on the feet were collected from the force platform. All of these input data were then inte- grated into the segment model to calculate the net moments at L5/ S1 expressed in the coordinate system of the pelvis (Ô¨Çexion- extension, lateral bending and torsion moments) using the equa- tions of Hof (1992) (see also Plamondon et al., 1996; Kingma et al., 2006). With the subject in the anatomical position, the longitudinal axis is upward, the sagittal axis is forward and the transverse axis is to the left. The Grood and Suntay (1983) method was used to es- timate 3D angular motion. The Ô¨Çexion/extension rotation is about the transverse axis of the pelvis (proximal segment), the torsion rotation is about the longitudinal axis of the trunk (distal segment), and the lateral bending rotation is about the Ô¨Çoating axis normal to the two preceding axes. The magnitude of the EMG signal was measured with a Root Mean Square (RMS) method with a moving average window of 100 ms. The median frequency (MF) of the EMG power spectrum was computed using the middle 3 s of the 5 s EMG signal period captured during the submaximal isometric contractions. Five transfers (2 self-paced round trips and 3 imposed-pace round trips) were performed by each subject. Considering the large number of data, it was decided to analyze only the last round trip of each pace (2nd of the self-paced and 3rd of the imposed pace). As there are two directions in a round trip, a going and a return, only the results in the going direction are presented here, which represented 1440 samples (30 subjects x 24 boxes x 2 paces). The going direction was broken down into two different phases: a lifting phase (depalletizing) and a deposit phase (palettizing). The lifting phase included a pre-lift (gripping), where the box is brought close to the subject without being lifted, and lifting of the box (take- off). The deposit phase begins after the lifting phase and continues to the deposit of the box until its Ô¨Ånal destination on the pallet. It should be emphasized that the duration of the Ô¨Çight phase (meaning the time during which the weight of the box was completely supported by the subject) was divided into two equal sections (time/2), such that the Ô¨Årst section was an integral part of the lift and the second an integral part of the deposit.  2.5.1. Dependent fatigue variables  The mean HR and the mean normalized HR were calculated for the two last goings (%HR ¬º HR/HRmax; HRmax ¬º (220-age); ACSM, 2006). EMG fatigue includes the RMS and MF values of the right and left longissimus muscles for the three EMG tests. Three Borg‚Äôs assessments were recorded, one after each EMG test.  2.5.2. Dependent biomechanical variables  Peak values were calculated in each phase (in the lifting phase and in the deposit phase) for the resultant moment at L5/S1 (i.e., the vector sum of the three moment components) and the asymmet- rical moment (i.e., the vector sum of the lateral bending and torsion moment components). Also, at the instant of the peak resultant moment (during the lifting and the deposit phases), the following were calculated: occurrence of the peak resultant moment (inter- pretation: 0e50% ¬º % of Ô¨Çight time in the lifting phase; 51e100% ¬º % of Ô¨Çight time in the deposit phase), lumbar Ô¨Çexion angle, lumbar lateral bending angle, lumbar torsion angle, lumbar Ô¨Çexion angular velocity, trunk inclination (trunk Ô¨Çexion angle from the vertical calculated from the local coordinate system at T12), horizontal distance of the hands (midpoint of a line joining the joint center of both wrists) from the L5/S1 joints, and the right and left knee  
A. Plamondon et al.  / Applied Ergonomics 45 (2014) 471e481  475  Ô¨Çexion angles. The lumbar Ô¨Çexion angle was also transformed to take into account the effect of age (Intolo et al., 2009; Troke et al., 2005). Each subject‚Äôs lumbar Ô¨Çexion angle was divided by his cor- responding predicted maximum Ô¨Çexibility (Intolo et al., 2009) to obtain a lumbar Ô¨Çexibility index (by multiplying by 100, a per- centage of the maximum lumbar Ô¨Çexibility is obtained). In addition, several other variables were calculated: task duration, pre-Ô¨Çight time, Ô¨Çight time, post-Ô¨Çight time, path length of the box and the cumulative moment at L5/S1 estimated as the sum of the resultant moment during the Ô¨Çight time. The path length of a box was deÔ¨Åned as the distance along which the box moves and was estimated using the midpoint of a line joining the joint center of both wrists. The path length was calculated only during the Ô¨Çight phase.  2.6.  Statistical analysis  There are four independent variables: 1) expertise (E) with two levels: experts and novices; 2) height (H) of the boxes with four levels: 1st ¬º 16 cm above the Ô¨Çoor, 2nd ¬º 48 cm, 3rd ¬º 80 cm; 4th ¬º 112 cm; 3) horizontal distance (D) of the boxes with two front ¬º box levels: front 0 cm from the edge of the pallet; back ¬º box front 27 cm from the edge; 4) pace (P) with two levels: self-paced and imposed pace. First, a two-way mixed-model ANOVA was applied to measure the effect of expertise and pace on the fatigue parameters: Borg‚Äôs assessment and heart rate. Second, a two way mixed-model ANOVA was applied to evaluate the same effect (expertise and pace) on back muscle fatigue between the EMG pre-test and the two EMG post-tests. The lifting phase and the deposit phase were analyzed inde- pendently, as the subjects were usually in an upright standing posture before each phase, and as direct transfers of boxes rarely occurred between pallets, limiting the effect of the boxes traveling from/to different vertical heights and horizontal distances. To assess the effect of the four independent variables (E, Hlifting, Dlifting and P), a four-way mixed-model ANOVA was performed on the biomechanical variables extracted from the lifting phase. The same was done to assess the effect of the four independent variables (E, Hdeposit, Ddeposit and P) on the biomechanical variables extracted from the deposit phase. As the task duration, Ô¨Çight time, path length and cumulative loading cover both phases, the vertical height (H) and horizontal distance (D) levels considered were exceptionally those during the lifting phase. To simplify the results, only these main effects and the most relevant double interactions were interpreted. NCSS software (version: 07.1.14; NCSS, Kaysville, UT, USA) was used to process the statistical data. In order to be able to carry out parametric analyses, the data were transformed based on the fundamental law of probabilities (van Albada and Robinson, 2007) allowing normal distributions to be obtained according to the WilkeShapiro test. Also, to offset a violation of sphericity in the mixed-model mea- surement ANOVAs, the probability threshold was adjusted using the Geisser greenhouse epsilon correction factor. For all statistical tests, a signiÔ¨Åcance level of p < 0.05 was used. TukeyeKramer  Table 3 Lifting pace, heart rate and fatigue results from the Borg scale (j) (n ¬º 30).  multiple pairwise comparisons were performed in case of signiÔ¨Å- cant main effects to detect differences between the levels of any independent variables.  3. Results  3.1.  Effect of  lifting pace and expertise on HR and fatigue  The imposed-pace MMH task (mean ¬º 9.5 lifts/min; SD ¬º 0.7) was signiÔ¨Åcantly more demanding than the self-paced task (mean ¬º 8.6 lifts/min; SD ¬º 2.1), which led to a higher HR and a higher perception of overall physical fatigue and back muscle fa- tigue (Table 3). There was no signiÔ¨Åcant expertise difference except for the normalized HR (% HRmax), thus revealing that the experts worked at a higher relative level of intensity than the novices. Both an increase in the EMG magnitude and a decrease in the median frequency of the back muscles between the pre-test and the post- tests were observed, but no difference was observed between the two post-tests (Table 4). This shows that there was some cumula- tive fatigue for all subjects during the two MMH paces but the imposed pace did not further increase back muscle fatigue.  3.2. Mixed-model ANOVA results for the biomechanical variables  As expected, the main effects of height (H) and horizontal dis- tance (D) are much more prevalent than the effect of expertise (E) or pace (P) (Table 5). The H  D interaction was the most frequent interaction, triple interactions rarely occurred, and 4-way in- teractions occurred only twice.  3.3.  Effect of expertise  In both the lifting and deposit phases, the peak resultant moment at L5/S1 was not signiÔ¨Åcantly different between the groups (Fig. 2, Tables 5 and 6), although the experts had lower values on average than novices at higher heights (signiÔ¨Åcant E  H interaction during lifting shown in Fig. 2). At the time of the peak resultant moment, several variables (mainly posture related) showed signiÔ¨Åcant differences between experts and novices (Tables 5 and 6). Experts exerted smaller lumbar Ô¨Çexion angles (Fig. 3), lumbar Ô¨Çexibility indices, and trunk inclinations (Table 6) than novices. In addition, the experts bent their knees more but only during the lifting phase when the boxes were near the ground (signiÔ¨Åcant E  H interaction shown in Fig. 4). Interestingly, the hand to L5/S1 distance was also smaller in the expert group (Fig. 5, than 5 on average) Table 6). Both groups showed limited (less trunk asymmetry (Table 6). The peak asymmetrical moment at L5/S1 (Fig. 6) did not differ between the two groups, although they were smaller on average in the expert group. The effect of expertise was not signiÔ¨Åcant for the duration variables (task duration, pre- Ô¨Çight time, Ô¨Çight time, post-Ô¨Çight time), path length and cumula- tive loading.

3.4.  Effect of  lifting height  The effect of box height was important for all the biomechanical variables. The effect of decreasing the lifting height was an increase in the peak L5/S1 resultant moment for both the deposit and lifting phases (Fig. 2). At the instant of the peak L5/S1 resultant moment, as box height decreased, the following variables increased: lumbar Ô¨Çexion angle (Fig. 3), trunk inclination angle (similar pattern as Fig. 3), left (Fig. 4) and right (similar to Fig. 4) knee Ô¨Çexion angles, and hand-L5/S1 horizontal distance (Fig. 5). The lifting height had  a signiÔ¨Åcant impact on the peak asymmetrical moment but the pattern was not as clear as the peak resultant moment. The asymmetrical moment was higher in the lifting phase at the top of the pile and lower at the bottom, and it was the opposite in the deposit phase (Fig. 6). Interestingly, the task duration, path length and cumulative loading (Fig. 7) were all smaller in the middle of the pile (box height 2 and 3 at the origin of the lift), with the boxes at the lowest (1) and highest (4) heights reaching higher magnitudes.  3.5.  Effect of horizontal distance  As expected, the peak resultant moment and the peak asym- metrical moment at L5/S1 increased as the boxes were picked from the back row of the pile at a longer distance from the workers (Figs. 2 and 6). This resulted in increased lumbar Ô¨Çexion (Fig. 3) and trunk inclination, particularly at the highest height (3-B and 4-B). The effect of distance on knee Ô¨Çexion was, however, less clear (Fig. 4). The effect of the horizontal distance of the boxes was larger during the pre- and post-Ô¨Çight times. It is worth noting that pre- Ô¨Çight time increased when the boxes were initially in the back- row position (compared to the front-row) but it was the opposite for the post-Ô¨Çight time. The reason for this is that in approximately 80% of the cases (Table 2), the boxes picked at the highest height were placed in the deposit at the lowest height; those at the lowest height, placed at the highest height and those picked in the back row placed in the front row.  3.6.  Effect of  lifting pace  The effect of pace was important, particularly for the pre-Ô¨Çight and post-Ô¨Çight times where the imposed pace was signiÔ¨Åcantly  Table 4 Fatigue results for the longissimus muscles for the group of experts (E) and novices (N).

The consequence of this was that, at the imposed pace, the total duration of the task was shorter, the cumulative loading was less, the peak resultant moment during the deposit was smaller, and the lumbar Ô¨Çexion and trunk inclination (at the peak resultant moment) were also smaller than in the self-paced rhythm (Table 7).  3.7. Height  distance interaction  There were several interactions between lifting height and horizontal distance (H  D) (Table 5).

This effect was observed for the peak resultant moment (Fig. 2), trunk inclination, and hand distance to L5/S1 (Fig. 5). In the deposit phase, the effect of the box horizontal distance was smaller at the lowest and highest heights (compared to the middle heights) for the peak resultant moment (Fig. 2), lumbar Ô¨Çexion (Fig. 3) and trunk inclination. Interestingly, it becomes easier for the workers to be closer to the box as the lifting height increases, especially when the box is in the front-row position (signiÔ¨Åcant H  D for the hand to L5/S1 distance; Fig. 5).  4. Discussion  This study showed that expert workers differed from novices mostly in the posture-related variables (lumbar Ô¨Çexion angle, trunk inclination, knee Ô¨Çexion) and much less in the back loading ones (peak resultant moment or asymmetrical moment at L5/S1). The uniqueness of this study resides in the fact that the experts were selected on at least three criteria and the novices (contrary to the vast majority of studies) had on average 6 months of experience, which eliminated the recruitment of naivette subjects. In addition, the continuous transfer of boxes from one pallet to another has been rarely studied in the biomechanical literature, and no major constraints were imposed on the subjects during the task except for  Fig. 3.

The trunk and lumbar posture results were distinctive but there was only a small effect of expertise on net back loadings. However, one difference was observed: while knee Ô¨Çexion was signiÔ¨Åcantly greater among the experts in Plamondon et al. (2010), a signiÔ¨Åcant difference was found only at the lowest height during lifting in the current study. It is possible that the continuous lifting and imposed pace forced the experts to reduce their knee Ô¨Çexion to save energy but, interestingly, this was not the case at the lowest height. To protect their spine, the experts possibly learned to bend their knees when the load was close to the ground, even at the cost of increased energy expenditure (see the interesting paper by Oliveira et al. (2005)). A detailed internal biomechanical model of the spine has to be used to understand whether this maneuver can effectively unload some lumbar spine structures. This is ongoing work.  Fig. 6.

Effect of expertise  Experts as compared to novice workers were expected to show lower back loading, have better postures and be more efÔ¨Åcient in reducing the task duration or cumulative loading. In fact, experts did indeed show less back loading but only at higher heights and not when the box was lifted from the bottom of the pallet. Their posture was quite different from the novices at the instant of the peak resultant moment as they bent their trunk and lumbar region less (even when age was accounted for with the lumbar Ô¨Çexibility index). Moreover, their knees were more Ô¨Çexed when the box was lifted from the Ô¨Çoor of the pallet. Experts were also closer to the box during both the lifting and the deposit phases. Fig. 8 illustrates an example of a representative posture difference between an expert and a novice worker at the time of the peak resultant moment during lifting. These results are similar to those found in Plamondon et al. (2010), where the task was a transfer of boxes from a conveyor to a hand trolley. In this previous study, the work context was different because the transfer of boxes was not continuous (sepa- rated by several periods of rest to avoid fatigue) and no lifting pace was imposed.

A. Plamondon et al.  / Applied Ergonomics 45 (2014) 471e481  479  Some studies have examined the effect of experience on different biomechanical variables. When there is a direct com- parison between groups of experienced and novice workers, the effect of experience is weak or moderate (Gagnon et al., 1996; Marras et al., 2006), especially for the moments at L5/S1 and not necessarily in the direction expected, meaning that the experi- enced handler would minimize these moments (Granata et al., 1999). However, a recent paper by Lee and Nussbaum (2012) found higher peak kinematic and kinetic measures among the experienced workers, suggesting a higher risk of low back injury. For instance, their experienced workers had a peak extension moment 65 Nm higher than the novices during the lifting of a 7- kg box (approximately). This large difference between the present study and Lee and Nussbaum (2012) could be explained by several reasons. The Ô¨Årst is the workers‚Äô selection criteria. The Lee and Nussbaum (2012) novices were students with no experience in frequent lifting and, according to the classiÔ¨Åcation of Farrington- Darby and Wilson (2006), should be assigned a level between ‚Äúnaivette‚Äù and ‚Äúnovice‚Äù. Our novices had on average six months of experience, which places them between ‚Äúnovice‚Äù and ‚Äúappren- tice‚Äù. Another distinction could increase the contrast between our two studies: the Lee and Nussbaum (2012) novices seems to have been very slow during the 7-kg box lifting, as their peak extension moment (101 Nm at 0 ; 86 Nm at 60 ) occurred later in the lifting phase and was approximately equal to the sum of the static component of the torso (66 Nm) and the box position (37 Nm) of the experienced workers. A third reason is the box weight (7 kg), which was half the weight of the one used in the present study (15 kg); this could have facilitated the work of their experienced workers, who may likely have been used to working with heavier boxes. A fourth reason is the task itself, because in Lee and Nussbaum (2012) a box had to be lifted and lowered 20 times while being held continuously. This holding had the impact that the peak extension moment was higher among the novices during the deposit phase than during the lifting phase, which did not happen among their experienced workers nor in all our workers and conditions. In other words, it is possible that the Lee and Nussbaum (2012) novices stopped the downward motion of the box during the deposit, which is unusual in experienced or expert workers. The novices being too slow in their task could be considered at risk. Lee and Nussbaum (2013) suggested in a sub- sequent paper that the higher torso kinematics and kinetics observed among their experienced workers had the advantage of putting them in a better balance maintenance and torso move- ment stability compared to the novices. These examples illustrate that worker expertise and task speciÔ¨Åcity are important deter- mining factors of back loading. In relation with the above comments, Kingma‚Äôs group published several interesting papers about the effect of lifting techniques on back loading (Faber et al., 2009b; Kingma et al., 2004, 2006,2010) and demonstrated that techniques could reduce back loading if the horizontal distance between the L5/S1 joint and the load handled are reduced. However, the effect of lifting techniques on spine loading is generally more important in studies in which precise instructions are given to the subjects. Instructions generally amplify the contrast between experimental conditions in order to create the highest possible impact on the outcome. The same is probably true when the participants‚Äô level of expertise ranges from ‚Äúnaivette‚Äù to ‚Äúmaster‚Äù (elite group of experts; Farrington-Darby and Wilson, 2006). Furthermore, experts are generally recognized as having the best techniques, which becomes particularly important as task complexity increases (Farrington-Darby and Wilson, 2006). The choice of task is then a critical issue, as a simple task may be too easy for the experts to use their skills, and a difÔ¨Åcult task might be too hard for the novices to attempt. The task investigated in this  study cannot be considered a complex one since there was no major body constraint (such as limited space), the physical fatigue was not high, and all the workers were familiar with the type of box transfer because they had some handling experience. Simply put, the experts were probably not in a work situation in which their skills were critical for reducing back loading (external back moment). This, however, demonstrates the limits of expertise in the reduction of spine loading as opposed to lifting height, as will be seen in the next paragraph.  4.2.  Effect of  lifting height and horizontal distance  The effect of lifting height was similar to that in other studies reporting greater back loading with lower lifting heights (Allread et al., 2000; Davis and Marras, 2005; Faber et al., 2009a; Hoozemans et al., 2008; Kingma et al., 2004, 2006; Lavender et al., 2003; Marras et al., 2000). As conÔ¨Årmed by other studies (Davis et al., 1998; Marras et al., 1997, 1999), the position from which the worker lifted a box from a pallet had a major effect on spine loading, with the lowest level characterizing the greatest loadings on the spine during lifting or deposit. This is not surprising because as the lifting height decreases, trunk Ô¨Çexion increases, generating an additional gravitational moment contribution due to the upper body mass (Hoozemans et al., 2008; Lavender et al., 2003) as well as an increase in the horizontal distance between the load and L5/S1 (Fig. 5). A very well-known principle for reducing the external moment at L5/S1 is to minimize the horizontal distance between the load and L5/S1 (Graveling et al., 2003). A box located in the back row of the pallet will produce a higher moment at L5/S1 than a box in the front row due to the longer horizontal distance (Lavender et al., 1999; Schipplein et al., 1995), unless the worker slides the load toward himself before lifting it (Faber et al., 2011). Faber et al. (2011) and Gagnon (2003) demonstrated that, after a training session, novice workers were able to be signiÔ¨Åcantly closer to the box during lifting than before training. On the other hand, the training had no effect on the horizontal distance during the deposit phase (Gagnon, 2003). Our experts were generally closer to the box than novices at the peak resultant moment (PRM) (Fig. 5) but both groups failed to sufÔ¨Åciently slide the back boxes to be as close as those located in the front row, particularly during the deposit phase. The only exception occurred when the boxes were lifted from the ground, probably because it would have been too difÔ¨Åcult to lift the box directly from the back-row location or simply because it was easier to slide the boxes toward the subject (H  D interaction). The difÔ¨Åculty in getting closer to the box is often caused by the friction between boxes. However, no subject mentioned this particular problem after the experi- ment, probably because they were familiar with it. Therefore the back-row location of a box increased the spine loading, and expertise had a small but signiÔ¨Åcant effect on the horizontal distance at PRM.  4.3.  Effect of  lifting pace  In general, the effect of lifting pace was small, probably because the difference between the self-paced and the imposed pace was small (less than 1 lift/min) and also because the subjects were working at a rhythm close to their usual working pace. In response to the increase in lifting pace, the subjects simply shortened the pre-lift and post-Ô¨Çight times and exerted less trunk inclination in the deposit phase. There was some cumulative fatigue between the two pace conditions but not to a level that would magnify the differences between experts and novices.  
480  4.4.  Perspective  A. Plamondon et al.  / Applied Ergonomics 45 (2014) 471e481  5.  Conclusion  According to Marras et al. (1997) and Hoozemans et al. (2008), the vertical location of the box is a far greater determinant of spine loading than the weight of the box alone. In this study, the effect of height and horizontal distance was very signiÔ¨Åcant on almost all the dependent variables. Plamondon et al. (2012) demonstrated that the variance attributable to lifting height or weight lifted was considerably more important in reducing back loading than the variance attributable to expertise. Large beneÔ¨Åts can be derived by elevating the pallet so that the boxes can be transferred from an elevated or adjustable platform such as a lift table (Marras et al., 1999), or a reduction in spinal loading at lower pallet heights can be obtained by the use of handles, which increases the vertical height of the hands and allows the participants to remain more upright when positioning the cases on the pallet (Davis et al., 1998; Marras et al., 1999). This does not mean that training employees in safe lifting techniques is not an important type of intervention. There are large improvements in skills development to expect be- tween ‚Äúnaivette‚Äù and ‚Äúexpert‚Äù workers, but this has its limits. As mentioned by Graveling (1991), even the best worker will be at risk in a badly designed workplace, and no amount of training will be effective. Furthermore, it is important not to resort to the lifting  slogan ‚ÄúBend your knees not your back‚Äù or ‚Äúlift with your legs not your  back.‚Äù What was learned from this study is that experts use that strategy, but only in a speciÔ¨Åc condition when the load is low. Therefore, promoting this slogan widely without any context would be a mistake because work conditions could change and preclude the application of this rule (Graveling, 1991). Finally, the training content should go further than just focusing on handling tech- niques. An expert handler is not only skillful in handling loads but also very wise in planning his work and avoiding stressful work situations (Lortie, 2002).  4.5.  Limitations of  the study  The limitations are the same as those discussed in Plamondon et al. (2010). There are many, and two of the most important are the work context (laboratory vs Ô¨Åeld work) and worker expertise. One of our major concerns was to allow the workers as much freedom as possible to apply their usual working techniques. However, the experts may have modiÔ¨Åed their usual work tech- nique because they were not familiar with the laboratory condi- tions or to obtain the investigator‚Äôs approval (social desirability bias). Moreover, the handling task investigated is one among hundreds of work contexts that exist and represents only a small sample of what can be found in the Ô¨Åeld. A second important limitation is that the deÔ¨Ånition of an expert worker is still far from clear, and the criteria used may not correspond to true expert workers. How to deÔ¨Åne a novice worker can also be discussed, but our criterion (6 months) avoids using subjects having no skill in MMH. A third limitation is that the expert workers are older than the novices. However, because age and expertise are closely related, it is not possible to completely attribute all the effects observed (such as the different lifting postures) to expertise alone. Another limitation is that we cannot exclude the possibility that the present posture-related Ô¨Åndings are explained by the healthy-worker effect (HWE). On the other hand, the fact that we recruited novice workers having on average six months of experience should have reduced the potential HWE because they were somewhat apt to do the job for at least some time. Considering individuals who work in the same workplace and go through the same selection process is a well-known strategy to decrease HWE (Li and Sung, 1999). There- fore, the results of this study must be interpreted and used with these limitations in mind.  The results of this experiment conÔ¨Årm those of Plamondon et al. (2010), i.e., the effect of expertise present in the posture-related variables, with experts Ô¨Çexing their lumbar spine less but bending their knees more during lifting, particularly when the box was located at the lowest level. The posture-related variables could have a major impact on the distribution of internal forces on the spine, but expertise had a very small effect on the external back loading variables (peak resultant moment and peak asymmetrical moment at L5/S1), which are important indicators of risk in terms of work-related back injuries. An ergonomic intervention with the aim of reducing external back loading should therefore primarily focus on major factors such as the height and horizontal distance of the load and not just on workers‚Äô technique.

s0003687013001348,"  There is a continuous and dynamic interaction between people and their surroundings that produces physiological and psycho- logical strain on the person, which consequently lead to changes in health, well-being and performance (Parsons, 2000; Clements- Croome, 2006; Lan et al., 2010; Lieble et al., 2012), and this inter- action has strong economic implications (Fisk, 2001; Mendell et al., 2002; Wargocki and Djukanovic, 2005; Wargocki and Sepp√§nen, 2006). It is a concerted effort of researchers, engineers and prac- titioners to Ô¨Ånd out how to quantify the effects of indoor envi- ronmental quality (IEQ) on occupants‚Äô productivity so that they can consequently be included when calculating building costs; at pre- sent they are not considered at all. Better work performance has been assumed to be one of the indicators of improved productivity that result in increased proÔ¨Åtability when performing such calcu- lations as illustrated by several examples provided in the literature (Wargocki and Sepp√§nen, 2006). Quantitative relationships have been proposed between indoor climate (ventilation rate, perceived  * Corresponding author.

There are many factors among others like level of education, skills, genders, circadian cycle, emotional states and response bias etc. that should be considered when investigating the relationship between indoor climate and human performance (Parsons, 2000; Clements- Croome, 2006; Lan et al., 2009). One of the factors is the so called speed-accuracy tradeoff effect (Wickelgren, 1977). Accuracy and speed are the two distinct aspects of human performance. Accuracy is a measure of the quality of a behavior. Measures of accuracy include number correct, percent correct, and probability of correct detections (Gawron, 2000). In human performance studies, the response time and other time-related measures have been used to attain informa- tion on the speed of work. IEQ-productivity research has usually used metrics of work speed rather than metrics of work accuracy. For studies performed in call centers, the speed of work expressed as average time per call or average handling time was used as a measure of work performance (Niemel√§ et al., 2002; Federspiel et al., 2004; Tham, 2004; Wargocki et al., 2004). Laboratory studies typically assessed work performance by having subjects performing (cogni- tive) tasks that simulated aspects of actual work and by subsequent evaluation of the speed (response time) and/or accuracy (percent errors), e.g. characters typed per unit time, number of completed addition/multiplication units per unit time etc. (Wyon, 1974; Wyon  0003-6870/$ e see front matter √ì 2013 Elsevier Ltd and The Ergonomics Society.

2  L. Lan et al.  / Applied Ergonomics xxx (2013) 1e6  et al., 1975; Wargocki et al., 1999, 2000; Bak√≥-Bir√≥ et al., 2004; Witterseh et al., 2004; Lan and Lian, 2009; Lan et al., 2009, 2010). The importance of speed and accuracy may differ according to the type of task. In addition, subjects in experiments concerning measurements of work performance may have the capability to compromise accuracy for speed. It is consequently quite difÔ¨Åcult to compare the task speed obtained under two different conditions and conclude that the condition with the lower speed is worse for performance unless we know that the error level under this con- dition was greater than or at least identical to that under another condition. It is reasonably safe, however to conclude that the per- formance is reduced in a condition in which speed is lower and there are more errors made (Wickelgren, 1977). Also in studies in which either accuracy or speed are not affected and thus do not create difÔ¨Åculty for interpreting the results, as in such a case either speed or accuracy can be separately used as measures of perfor- mance (Hancock and Vasmatzidis, 1998; Pilcher et al., 2002; Wargocki et al., 2004; Wargocki and Wyon, 2007a,b; Lan and Lian, 2009; Lan et al., 2009). The problem is more complicated if speed and accuracy go in two opposite directions, because within the capacity of a person, increased speed of work may eventually compromise the accuracy and vice versa (Wickens and Hollands, 2000). For example, Eysenck and Willett (1962) have shown that during high arousal level, subjects performed less well on the Tsaie Partington test by making more errors, while at the same time their speed of work increased. It is difÔ¨Åcult to interpret such experi- mental results and use them, for example, to quantitatively predict the effects of indoor environmental quality on performance in real ofÔ¨Åces. Consequently, it would be useful to develop a procedure that would eliminate such interpretation dilemma, e.g. by devel- oping the method in which the speed and accuracy are integrated into one measure deÔ¨Åning the overall effect of environmental conditions on performance. Attempts to achieve this goal have been made in the past. For example, Bak√≥-Bir√≥ et al. (2004) measured separately speed and accuracy and then multiplied them with equal weights to create the overall performance index illustrating their results. Another approach was used by Tanabe and Nishihara (2004) and Tsutsumi et al. (2007) who used the correct answer speed in the addition task as a measure of overall performance which excluded errors and indicated the number of correct answers a subject could complete every minute. In this paper an approach to measure human performance with one composite index integrating speed and accuracy was proposed and the method was checked experimentally with thermal envi- ronment as the prototypical example.  2.

Along with noise control, privacy, safety and general ambience, way-Ô¨Ånding in health facilities can profoundly affect patient and family well-being (Frasca-Beaulieu, 1999). Visitors to a health facility rely on signs with text and symbols to navigate to speciÔ¨Åc destinations such as a laboratory or an imaging room. Signs with visual symbols are suited for rapid communication with the ability to cross age and language boundaries (Foster, 2001). Way-Ô¨Ånding signs help greatly in faster escape during emergencies (Tang et al., 2009). Apart from being rapidly interpretable, symbols are compact and yet more promi- nent and noticeable than textual signs (Foster, 2001; Shieh and Huang, 2003). Symbols are easier to follow and more likely to be understood and retained than multilingual text signs by patients from diverse language backgrounds.

A set of healthcare symbols has been developed after testing in the US (Hablamos Juntos, 2004), and several hospitals have incor- porated them in way-Ô¨Ånding signage with positive results (Cooper, 2010). Unfortunately, these ‚Äòuniversal healthcare symbols‚Äô have not been extensively tested in an international multicultural context to assess their application for global use. As more patients from diverse backgrounds seek care across regional borders, universally recognized healthcare symbols are imperative. Our setting, the city of Al Ain in the rapidly developing United Arab Emirates (UAE), is a highly multicultural mix with its native Arabic community as well as a large (69 percent) expatriate population (Statistics Center Abu Dhabi, 2012) from North America, Europe, Africa and South Asia. Local hospitals tend to utilize monolingual (English only) and bilingual (English and Arabic) text-based signs with general- purpose symbols such as for exit and no smoking. Thus, visitors to healthcare facilities from certain demographic groups may experience barriers to access and way Ô¨Ånding. We conducted this study to Ô¨Ånd out whether persons from different cultures, age groups and literacy levels interpret standard healthcare symbols correctly.

FireÔ¨Åghters are often exposed to multi-stressors, including intense and sustained physical tasks, environmental ex- tremes, anxiety, uncertainty, and obligations of victim rescue. There is considerable anecdotal documentation of these multi-stressors negatively impacting on the ability to process cognitive informa- tion and act quickly, effectively, and decisively (Grandjean and Grandjean, 2007; Hancock and Vasmatzidis, 2003). Furthermore, a Ô¨ÅreÔ¨Åghting job is characterized by shift work which can contribute to episodic sleepiness, and may cause deterioration of alertness and  * Corresponding author.

A recent article highlighted sleep disruption, heat, and smoke on physical and cognitive performance encountered by wildland Ô¨ÅreÔ¨Åghters (Aisbett et al., 2012). Impaired cognition and mood would likely increase risks of injuries and accidents. Caffeine and menthol might provide a practical intervention to preserve sufÔ¨Åcient mental efforts during Ô¨ÅreÔ¨Åghting missions. The behavioral effects of caffeine as a stimulus are well known. Following crossing the blood-brain barrier, caffeine binds to adenosine re- ceptors and exerts centrally psychostimulant effects through antagonism of adenosine A1 receptors. Caffeine‚Äôs well-documented stimulating effect on human cognition and mood include increased alertness, attention, vigilance, and memory (Lieberman, 2001; Nehlig, 2010). For shift workers, use of caffeine products are likely to be encouraged for prevention of work errors and possible injuries resulted from fatigue and sleepiness (Ker et al., 2010). The beneÔ¨Åcial effects on cognitive information processing likely contribute to the widespread use of this drug. Menthol has a mild arousal effect.

Nasal inhalation or oral administration of menthol brings perceived sensation of breathing cool and fresh air and of improved airÔ¨Çow; it has been suggested this cool sensation inÔ¨Çuences arousal and alertness levels (Eccles, 2000). Mints and lozenges with menthol additive are frequently used in situations where a mild stimulus is required to maintain alertness. Interestingly, M√ºndel and Jones (2009) studied swilling menthol solution during exercise in a hot environment and it was found endurance capacity was enhanced by an average of 9% with menthol. They suggested that change in the sense of effort (average of 15% reduction in ratings of perceived exertion) partially accounted for the improvement in heat tolerance. Thus, effects of stimulus such as caffeine and menthol might be expected, especially when individuals experience low arousal and high fatigue levels, or in tasks requiring explicit and sustained cognitive processing, or in situations of high demand on controlled mood. Therefore, for Ô¨ÅreÔ¨Åghters experiencing dehydrated, hyperthermic, and exhausted states, caffeine and menthol might offer simple solutions for combating fatigue and preserving cognitive information processing and mood. Failure to detect any dangerous situations can be critical and life-threatening. Therefore, this study examined the separate ef- fects of caffeine and menthol on cognition and mood during a simulated Ô¨ÅreÔ¨Åghting exposure. We hypothesized that in a heat stress prolonged exercise condition, caffeine and menthol would increase cognitive performance and improve mood across time relative to placebo. Administrators need to be aware of the poten- tial for mental efforts deÔ¨Åcits in highly stressful situations and seek potential interventions to mitigate adverse effects.  2. Material and methods  2.1.  Participants  Ten males, unacclimatized to heat, volunteered to participate in this study. They were conÔ¨Årmed to be regular coffee drinkers, consuming at least one cup of regular coffee per day. Their physical characteristics were age: 24  4 yr, height: 179  6 cm, weight: 76.3  15.3 kg, per- centage of body fat: 5%, and maximal oxygen uptake: 52.8  5.3 ml kg  1 min  1. This study was approved by the university‚Äôs Institutional Review Board for protection of human subjects.  8   2.2.  Experimental design  This study used a placebo-controlled, counter-balanced cross- over repeated measures design. This study required participants to complete four laboratory visits. Experimental trials were con- ducted once per week. The Ô¨Årst visit consisted of preliminary testing, workload assessment, and familiarization. The remaining three visits were experimental trials with placebo, caffeine, or menthol treatments. For the caffeine trial, caffeine was adminis- tered in capsule form (400 mg of caffeine) ten minutes prior to the 1st treadmill exercise. For the menthol and placebo trials, partici- pants took menthol lozenges (10-mg menthol, 6-mg benzocaine) (Chloraseptic, Prestige Brands, USA), or placebo lozenges (6-mg benzocaine) (Cepacol Fizzlers, Combe Inc., USA). Each of the three trials consisted of a baseline assessment of cognition and mood (described below) followed by repeated post-treatment assess- ments. Before each experimental day, participants were asked to refrain from strenuous exercise and consuming any caffeine- containing drinks or food from 8 P.M. the previous evening until completion of the trial during the experimental day. The Ô¨Årst visit was to determine individual‚Äôs maximal oxygen uptake and maximal heart rate from a graded treadmill test, and the consequent individual workloads. Each experimental trial  consisted of two treadmill exercises and one stepping exercise with brief rest periods between the each exercise phase. For the tread- mill exercise, participants performed 4 bouts of 4 min of walking on a motor-driven treadmill to elicit a metabolic rate of 60% maximal oxygen uptake followed by 1 min of 15 arm curls (bar weighing 4.5 kg). For the stepping exercise, participants performed 4 bouts of 4 min of constant cadence stepping exercise at a cadence of 25 steps per min (using a metronome) on a 40-cm high platform followed by 1-min 15 arm curls. Participants were required to complete this familiarization trial to ensure that they were acquainted with the exercise regime, equipment, and measurement scales. Three sam- ple sets of cognition and mood tests were also introduced and practiced during the familiarization period to reduce learning ef- fects. Participants verbally conÔ¨Årmed their conÔ¨Ådence with all experimental protocols after the initial visit. During the experimental days, participants were asked to provide a urine sample to verify the hydration status prior to the trials. Par- ticipants were not tested if they were dehydrated (urine speciÔ¨Åc gravity >1.020). Participants‚Äô nude body weight (shorts only) was measured on a calibrated scale (Detecto Scales Inc., USA). Partici- pants then self-inserted a rectal thermocouple (Physitemp, USA) and the rectal temperature was monitored with a portable system (Physitemp Thermalert model TH-8, USA). Participants donned a Polar heart rate monitor (Polar, USA). During the experimental trials, participants wore Ô¨ÅreÔ¨Åghter protective clothing (i.e., turnout coat/ pants made of Nomex Ô¨Åber out shell with Goretex barrier (LION, USA) and gloves (American Firewear Inc., USA)), a self-contained breathing apparatus tank (Survivair Respirators Inc., USA), and a helmet (E.D. Bullard Co., USA). Instead of Ô¨ÅreÔ¨Åghting boots, athletic shoes were worn to avoid unnecessary discomfort. The total weight of the personal protective equipment was approximately 19.1 kg. The environmental chamber setting for three 20-min exercise periods was 35 C wet bulb global temperature (wet: 31  C, dry: 45  C, globe: 43  C; 40% relative humidity). During two 15-min rest periods, participants were seated in the main laboratory room temperature was 21  1 C (45% relative hu- where the ambient midity). Participants took either one menthol lozenge (menthol trial) or placebo lozenge (caffeine and placebo trials) and entered the environmental chamber. They Ô¨Årst completed a set of cognition tests (i.e., simple reaction test, followed by a short-term memory test, and math test) and a mood assessment. Then participants completed the 1st 20-min treadmill exercise, exited the environ- mental chamber, and completed the 1st 15-min rest period. Water was freely available during rest periods and volume consumed was recorded. A 2nd lozenge was taken prior to the 2nd treadmill ex- ercise. Then participants repeated the 2nd 20-min treadmill exer- cise. Immediately after the 2nd treadmill exercise, participants completed another set of cognitions tests and mood assessment in the environmental chamber. Then participants exited the envi- ronmental chamber and completed the 2nd 15-min rest period. A 3rd lozenge was provided prior to the stepping exercise. Partici- pants re-entered the environmental chamber and performed the stepping exercise. Immediately after the stepping exercise, partic- ipants completed the Ô¨Ånal set of cognition tests and a mood assessment in the environmental chamber. Upon dofÔ¨Ång all gear except shorts, participants were weighed again at the end.  2.3. Measurements  2.3.1. Rectal temperature, heart rate, body weight loss, rating of perceived exertion  Rectal temperature and heart rate were monitored and recorded every 5 min throughout the experimental periods. Body weight loss was calculated as change in pre-trial and post-trial nude body weight adjusted by total Ô¨Çuid volume taken during rest periods.

Simple reaction test  The simple reaction test (O‚ÄôNeal and Bishop, 2010) was per- formed on a laptop computer. In a task box orbiting on the computer screen, participants had 30 s to mouse-click a black dot that randomly appeared in a 6  10 grid of white circles. Participants were required to click on the target dot as soon as they detected the dot. For every correct click, one point was added and every incor- rectly clicked circle (e.g., miss clicked the closing dot) resulted in one point taken away. The total reaction score was recorded at the end.  2.3.3.  Short-term memory test  In the short-memory test (O‚ÄôNeal and Bishop, 2010), a list of 15 words was presented via automated slides Ô¨Çashing on a laptop screen at a rate of one word every 4 s. All of the words were nouns Ô¨Åve letters long. No plurals or names were used. Participants were told to remember as many words as possible. Immediately after 1 min of memory, participants were given 2 min to use a pencil to write down (no order required) all the words that they could remember on a piece of blank paper. The dependent variable was the number of words correctly recalled (the higher, the better; no penalty for words not on the list).  2.3.4. Math test  The serial addition/subtraction test was a mathematical test requiring sustained attention. This test has been shown to be a reliable and valid measurement of sustained attention (Thorne et al., 1983). For this test, two randomly selected digits and either a plus or minus sign were presented on a paper. The participant performed test and entered the least signiÔ¨Åcant digit of the result (e.g., ‚Äú7,5,√æ‚Äù equals 12, so write down 2). There were total of 20 addition/subtraction tasks performed during each math test. The dependent variables were response accuracy (number of correct responses; the higher, the better), response time (speed of response; the quicker, the better). The response time was recorded using a hand hold stopwatch.  2.3.5.  Retrieval memory test  At the end of the stepping exercise, participants were shown 30 words which consisted of the 15 words shown at the 2nd short- term memory test plus 15 new distracter words. Participants had 2 min to decide which words were in the earlier list of 15. The dependent variables were the number of correct responses (correctly accepting target words and correctly rejecting distracter words) and the number of false responses (wrongly accepting a distracter as being in the original list). The Ô¨Ånals score was calcu- lated from correct responses minus false responses. Given a small dose (i.e., 40 mg) of caffeine is associated with improved alertness, attention, and retrieval memory task (Smith et al., 1999).  2.3.6. Mood  Mood was assessed using 100-mm visual analogue rating scales (Smith et al., 1999). These 18 scales (e.g., Tense/Calm, Muzzy/Clear- headed, Antagonistic/Friendly) can be categorized into three fac- tors: alertness, hedonic tone, and tension. Each factor score was calculated by summarizing the scores of the individual mood ad- Anxiety Mood ¬º Relaxed/Excited √æ jectives (e.g., Troubled/ Tranquil √æ Tense/Calm), and was later used in the statistical anal- ysis. These scales are reported to be sensitive to caffeine adminis- tration for fatigued personnel (Smith et al., 1999).  2.4.  Statistics analyses  Fig. 1.

Statistical difference was consid- ered to be signiÔ¨Åcant at alpha 0.05.  3. Results  3.1.  Physiological responses  Heart rate responses are shown in Fig. 1. Heart rate was signiÔ¨Å- cantly elevated relative to baseline throughout the exercise periods. There was no signiÔ¨Åcant difference in heart rates among the three conditions (p > 0.05). At the end of the experimental period, rectal temperatures were 39.0  0.2  C, 39.0  0.2 C, 39.1  0.1 C, for placebo, menthol, and caffeine trials, respectively (p > 0.05). Exercise- heat stress resulted in mean dehydration of 3.1 (0.7)%, 3.1 (0.7)%, 3.0 (0.7)%, for placebo, menthol, and caffeine trials, respectively.  3.2.  Perceived exertion, mood, and cognition  Effects of caffeine and menthol on perceived exertion were shown in Fig. 2. Perceived exertion signiÔ¨Åcantly increased during the exercise periods (p < 0.05). There was no difference in perceived exertion among the three conditions (p > 0.05). Exercise- heat stress caused dramatic decreases in all three mood ratings (Fig. 3) (p < 0.05), but caffeine and menthol treatments did not signiÔ¨Åcantly affect the mood compared to the placebo (p > 0.05). Changes in cognition are summarized in Table 1. Generally, neither simple reaction test, short-term memory test, nor retrieval memory test were affected by experimental exposure to the heat and exercise or treatments (p > 0.05). For the math test, repeated exercise and rest intervals did not alter the response accuracy (p > 0.05); however, participants showed faster response times (p < 0.05) during the two post-exposure tests. There was no difference in math test perfor- mance among the three conditions (p > 0.05).  A repeated measures Analysis of Variance was used, and when a signiÔ¨Åcant main effect was found, Fisher‚Äôs LSD was performed to  Fig. 2.

Y. Zhang et al.  / Applied Ergonomics 45 (2014) 510e514  513  Research suggests that dehydration in heat or during exercise would cause a signiÔ¨Åcant reduction in cognitive performance (Cian et al., 2000, 2001; Grandjean and Grandjean, 2007). During a dehy- drated and fatigued state, it was anticipated that caffeine and menthol might exert a positive effect on information processing ability. We compared the treatment effects from immediate assessment of a various simple cognitive measurements that are sensitive to effects of caffeine when a person is fatigued (Smith et al., 1999). However, our results found caffeine and menthol did not alter the cognitive information processing during dynamic heat exposure. Our results suggested cognitive information processing capacity, speed, and accuracy were well maintained over the experimental period. This is in agreement with the Ô¨Åndings involving a group of U.K. Ô¨ÅreÔ¨Åghters in which no change in rapid visual information processing, spatial memory span, and choice reaction time were detected following a Ô¨ÅreÔ¨Åghting simulation (Rayson et al., 2005). Hence, acute exercise in heat may exert enhancement in cognition (Hancock, 1982; Hancock et al., 2007), evidenced in our results, in that the completion time of the math test was actually improved (i.e., shortened) (Table 1) during later bouts of exercise without sacriÔ¨Åcing the accuracy. Therefore, despite the rigorous nature of exercise and the extreme environment, cognition was well main- tained in our testing conditions over three Ô¨ÅreÔ¨Åghting work/rest transitions. It should also be pointed out that, our participants were well rested before each experimental trial. In real world situations, continuous shift work is typical for Ô¨ÅreÔ¨Åghters particularly, and a state of sleep deprivation creates practical situations where both caffeine and menthol might be expected to exert their alerting ef- fects. This paradigm warrants further testing. Maintenance of a positive mood (e.g., alertness, calmness) is a matter of important consideration for safety and mission success. All mood states substantially deteriorated even with regular rest periods (Fig. 3). Working in a multi-stressors environment brings about a rapid transition from positive mood to a state that might impact on the mission success. It is logical to believe that caffeine administration, which may partially restore the mood states, could be beneÔ¨Åcial under such circumstances. However, neither caffeine nor menthol provided any positive effect on mood. There was also no positive effect on perception of fatigue status neither. Though one previous study (Hogervorst et al., 2008) employing a similar exercise regime of cycling at 60% oxygen uptake for 150 min, re- ported no effect of caffeine on perceived exertion, the majority of the literature suggest that caffeine could reduce perceived exertion (Doherty and Smith, 2005). Another study of swilling a menthol solution also suggested that menthol reduced global perceived exertion and delayed time to fatigue (M√ºndel and Jones, 2009). It is unlikely that the current protocol duration was too short to observe positive effects of caffeine on mood, since peak plasma time of orally administered caffeine usually presents within 45 min period (Mumford et al., 1994). It is likely that the intense nature of exercise and extreme environment may suppress effects of caffeine or menthol. None of previous studies had tested a condition that involved in combination of protective clothing, heat strain, and eliciting near maximal exercise capacity. It is possible that the challenging testing protocol overwhelmed any small positive effect of caffeine (e.g., average of 6% of advantage in rating of perceived exertion in literature) (Doherty and Smith, 2005) or menthol on mood and perception. An alternative possibility is that our partic- ipants were less accustomed to the Ô¨ÅreÔ¨Åghting scenario (e.g., pro- tective clothing and equipment, extreme radiate heat, and profuse sweating), and therefore might have over-responded to the testing conditions, blunting any positive effect of treatments on cognition or mood ratings. Current results could not conÔ¨Årm caffeine or menthol treatments would allow better mental tolerance to intense exercise in the heat.  Fig. 3. Mean (SD) mood ratings over the experimental period.

Discussion  Changes in mental efforts during Ô¨ÅreÔ¨Åghting are little known due to limited data. In this study, repeated Ô¨ÅreÔ¨Åghting-simulating exercise was performed in a hot environment. After a total of 90- min experimental period (including 15 min for each of two rest periods), exercise-heat stress caused signiÔ¨Åcant cardiovascular strain, dehydration, and a hyperthermic state, which are considered to be detrimental for both physical and mental efforts (Barr et al., 2010; Grandjean and Grandjean, 2007). The current laboratory- based simulations somewhat resemble physical challenges in Ô¨Åeld environments. Based on the experimental conditions and re- sults of this study, the cognition should not be impaired for short Ô¨ÅreÔ¨Åghter missions under one hour, though mood could be nega- tively affected under multi-stressors. Furthermore, acute adminis- tration of caffeine or menthol presented no ergogenic effect on perceived exertion, cognition, or mood, at least under current test conditions of a high heat strain and a dynamic exercise protocol. To our knowledge, this is the Ô¨Årst study seeking practical interventions on mental efforts during simulated Ô¨ÅreÔ¨Åghting tasks. The series of simple cognition tests were selected due to their relevance to speciÔ¨Åc operations Ô¨ÅreÔ¨Åghters often encounter in a Ô¨Åre scene. For examples, the ability to maintain sustained attention and rapidly detect threats is signiÔ¨Åcant in a hazardous environment: reaction to intervene and take appropriate actions; and memory to recall of important details such as critical geographic locations to navigate rescue and evacuation. Meanwhile, Lieberman et al. (2006) have suggested simple cognition tests are more sensitive and suit- able for use in a multi-stressors environment than complex tests.

514  Y. Zhang et al.  / Applied Ergonomics 45 (2014) 510e514  Taken the above results collectively, it was relatively surprising to Ô¨Ånd that participants were able to maintain cognitive function despite less favorable perceived exertion and mood ratings since it is generally believed that fatigue (i.e., physically as of heart rate, rectal temperature, dehydration, and psychologically as of perceived exertion, mood) is associated with a reduction in mental efforts. Whereas lack of a clear functional hypothesis to explain this rela- tionship, from a positive standpoint, possible defensive mechanism would allow Ô¨ÅreÔ¨Åghters to continue working at a high operational efÔ¨Åciency; on the other hand, Ô¨ÅreÔ¨Åghters may also expose them- selves into greater risks of accidents if the mission lengthens beyond one hour as in our test condition (e.g., wildland Ô¨ÅreÔ¨Åghting mis- sions). This observation should also be explored further. Lastly, it is worth noting that simulated Ô¨ÅreÔ¨Åghting protocol and environments are not the same as in a Ô¨Åre situation. Clearly, other hazardous factors (e.g., smoke) and emotional pressures are not faced up to in our participants and would likely cause underesti- mation of the mental efforts deÔ¨Åcits in Ô¨ÅreÔ¨Åghters and restrict ac- curate conclusions made about performance changes in harsh rescue environments. Incidents and accidents from errors are more likely to occur in work place practice and future Ô¨Åeld studies remain needed.  5.  Conclusions  This study examined potential practical interventions for per- formance deÔ¨Åcits in a multi-stressors work environment. Working in a thermal stressful environment dramatically deteriorated mood states and increased perceived exertion. Cognition was minimally altered during exercise-heat exposure. Furthermore, under this challenging multi-stressors environment, no potential ergogenic effects were found with caffeine or menthol. Both physiological and mental efforts are critical for the health, safety, and operational effectiveness for Ô¨ÅreÔ¨Åghting. Impact of exercise in hazardous en- vironments on mental efforts warrants more attention for planning and preparing Ô¨ÅreÔ¨Åghters.

s0003687013001476,"  Winter sports are popular. Skiing is enjoyed by approximately 200 million people in the world (Hunter, 1999). Important factors to enjoy the sport are performance and comfort of the ski boots, which act as an interface between skier and skis. Several studies focused on the mechanical properties of ski boots with respect to performance (Corazza and Cobelli, 2005; Schaff and Hauser, 1993; Schaff et al., 1997). Besides mechanical properties the quality of ski boots is determined by their comfort characteristics. Comfort of ski boots is related to the correct Ô¨Åt of the boot and to the  * Corresponding author. Tel.: √æ43 512 507 4483; fax: √æ43 512 507 2656. E-mail addresses: patrick.hofer@uibk.ac.at (P.

Temperature is the most critical factor for assessing thermal wear comfort (Senthilkumar and Dasaradan, 2007). Foot temperature is determined by ambient temperature, duration of the exposure to cold, level of physical activity, and moisture in the ski boot (Gavin, 2003; Rissanen and Rintam√§ki, 2009). Ski boots possess quite good thermal insulation properties. But moisture vapour transmission through the ski boot liner is in general hindered by laminated liner materials. Foot sweating and lack of moisture vapour transmission through the liner lead to moisture saturation inside the ski boot. The presence of condensate facilitates the conductive heat loss. Hence sweat or melted snow in the liner increase the thermal conductance and leads to insulation break downs (Fauland et al., 2011; Heus et al., 2005; Kuklane, 2009; Kuklane et al., 1999). Despite the importance of the temperature management for feeling comfortable there are no published data about the climate in ski boots during skiing. So the purpose of this study was to determine the microclimate in ski boots assessed by temperature, relative humidity, and water absorption.  0003-6870/$ e see front matter √ì 2013 Elsevier Ltd and The Ergonomics Society.

2  2. Method  P. Hofer et al.  / Applied Ergonomics xxx (2013) 1e6  The microclimate in the ski boot was assessed during imitated skiing in a climate chamber and during Ô¨Åeld tests. (Mean  SD: age 32.0  5.3 years, body Five male subjects height 181.6  3.6 cm, body mass 79.4  9.7 kg) were exposed in the climate chamber for 1.5 h to ambient temperatures of √æ10 C, 0  C,  10  C, and  20  C. All subjects were in good health and were experienced skiers. Relative humidity was set to 65%. The climate chamber (K√§ltepol Inc., AT) allows adjusting ambient temperature ( 30 to √æ60  C) and relative humidity (10e90%). All tests were performed in the morning hours with intervals of at least 1 day between two measurements. Preparations for the tests took about 20 min in an ante-chamber at room temperature. Skiing respec- tively lift transportation was imitated by repeated 1 min 90 box squats with a loaded barbell followed by a 10 min break sitting on a chair. A metronome gave the rhythm of 40 beats per minute for the squats. Barbell and discs (Eleiko Sport Inc., SE) were loaded with 20% of body weight. The measurement started with a 10 min rest period. Temperature and relative humidity were measured in the liner between skin and sock using four SHT15 sensors (Sensirion Inc., CH). These sensors have a thickness of 2.5 mm and a surface area of 0.37 cm2. The four sensors were placed with FIXOMULL (BSN medical Inc., DE) at the lateral side of the metatarsophalangeal joint of the Ô¨Årst toe (toe sensor), in the arch of the foot sole (sole sensor), on the dorsum of the foot above os cuneiforme II (dorsum sensor), and between liner and shell above the medial ankle (shell sensor). The signals were stored using a 122 g data logger Ô¨Åxed at the lower leg. To determine the amount of water in liner and sock a precision balance (Kern 500, Kern & Sohn Inc., DE) was used. Immediately after the test liners and socks were weighed separately. In order to prevent evaporation before weighing liner and sock were placed in a pre-weighed airtight plastic bag. The weight of liner and sock respectively was recorded before and after testing as well as after drying. From the relative humidity and temperature the absolute humidity was calculated. The subjects were asked for subjective ratings every 20 min and at the end of the test. The subjective responses on thermal sensa- from √æ4 ¬º very hot to  4 ¬º very cold) tion (scale and pain sensation (scale from 0 ¬º no pain to 4 ¬º intolerable pain) were recorded in an observation sheet (ISO 10551, 1995). The subjects used their own skiing clothes. The clothes were chosen individual based on the ambient temperature. For the same ambient temperature the same clothes were worn. Long-  legged and long-sleeved underwear, socks, ski jacket and trou- sers, knitted cap, gloves, and scarf were used. The subjects wore socks of the same type (Speedmachine, Nordica Inc., IT) of the following composition: 18% wool, 40% acrylic, 40% polyamide, and 2% elastane. Prior to the test the ski boots were cooled in the climate chamber at the test temperature for 45 min. The subjects put on the ski boots in the climate chamber. During the test the buckles of the ski boots stayed locked. Each subject had to perform the test twice with different ski boots (Edge√æ8.5 and Vector 120, Head Inc., AT). Field tests were carried out with two male subjects (age 31 and 41 years, body height 188 and 180 cm, body mass 83 and 65 kg) on Ô¨Åve skiing days. The subjects performed recreational skiing on all terrain without rests between 1.6 and 5.4 h per day. The sensor setup and skiing clothing ensemble were the same as during the climate chamber tests. Additionally, ambient temperature and ambient relative humidity were recorded in the middle part of the slope with a meteorological station. Prior approval for the testing was given by the Institutional Review Board. The subjects were informed of any risks associated with participation in the tests and gave written informed consent before the testing. Testing was carried out according to the Decla- ration of Helsinki.  3.

In Fig. 3 the mean (SD) of the minimal sensor temperature during the climate chamber tests at the measured ambient tem- peratures are presented. With decreasing ambient temperature the sensors showed lower minimal temperatures. For the sole and dorsum sensors nearly the same minimal values were measured whereas the toe sensor was between 4.5 and 9.1 C lower. At the temperature of  20  C the minimal ambient temperature of the shell sensor decreased below 0 C. Fig. 4 shows the mean of the toe sensor temperature during the climate chamber test at the measured ambient temperatures. At the beginning of the tests the temperature of the toe sensor was around 25  C and decreased subsequently. After 30e72 min the temperature dropped below 20 C except at 10  C ambient temperature. In Fig. 5 the relation between toe sensor temperature and thermal/pain sensation after 1.5 h in the climate chamber is pre- sented.

The Ô¨Årst signs of thermal and pain sensation were re- ported when toe sensor temperature was about 5 C lower than the the metatarsal sensors. Very cold (value  4) and temperature of intolerable pain (value 4) were sensed when the temperature dif- ference was about 9  C. During the six Ô¨Åeld tests the ambient temperature was between  6.8  C and 6.0 C and the ambient relative humidity between 36% and 70%. The mean temperatures during the Ô¨Åeld tests were 22.1  3.3  C at the toe sensor, 30.4  1.7  C at the dorsum sensor, 30.6  1.7 C at the sole sensor, and 10.8  1.6  C at the shell sensor. The toe sensor temperature dropped in four cases clearly below 20  C and the difference between toe and metatarsal sensors was in all tests more than 5 C. The lowest temperatures were measured between shell and liner with 5.2 C, at the toe with 13.9 C, at the dorsum with 25.7 C, and at the sole with 25.8  C. Fig. 7 shows exemplarily the temperature in the ski boot for a subject during skiing. During this test mean ambient temperature and humidity were 5.2  0.6  C and 65  1.1% respectively. At the beginning of the test the sensor temperatures showed the highest value and subsequently a clear decrease to the ambient tempera- ture occurred within circa 1 h. During the six Ô¨Åeld tests the relative humidity ranged from 50 to 93% at the toe, from 22 to 89% at the dorsum, from 30 to 91% at the sole, and from 16 to 87% at the shell sensor (between shell and liner  Fig. 8.

The mean values for the absolute humidity were 16  1.2 g/m3 at the toe, 23  0.7 g/m3 at the dorsum, 17  1.5 g/m3 at the sole, and 5  0.7 g/m3 at the shell sensor during the tests. Fig. 8 shows the relative humidity in the ski boot corresponding to the temperature values in Fig. 7. The curves show an increase of all sensors. The mean water absorption was 4.3 g for the socks and 26.3 g for the liners over an average test period of 4 h. Fig. 9 compares the water absorption in the liners during climate chamber and Ô¨Åeld tests at 0  C ambient temperature. After the 1.5 h climate chamber tests water absorption between 2 and 7 g (Table A.2) whereas after a 1.5 h Ô¨Åeld test 17 g and after a 4 h Ô¨Åeld test 38 g were measured.  4. Discussion  During all climate chamber and Ô¨Åeld tests the temperature inside the ski boot decreased. In the climate chamber the tem- the toe dropped below 20 C at an ambient perature at temper- ature of 0  C,  10  C,  20  C and in the Ô¨Åeld in four of six cases. Due to the absence of big foot muscles the foot is warmed mainly by blood Ô¨Çow. However, the blood Ô¨Çow is already signiÔ¨Åcantly temperatures below 25 C (Allwood and Burry, reduced at foot 1954; Kaufmann, 1983). This problem may be ampliÔ¨Åed in ski boots since bad Ô¨Åtting of the ski boot may reduce the blood Ô¨Çow additionally. Once the Ô¨Çow through the superÔ¨Åcial veins of the lower leg has ceased, rewarming the foot does not produce su- perÔ¨Åcial Ô¨Çow until the whole body is sufÔ¨Åciently warmed (Kaufmann, 1983). Sensitive movements of the feet are necessary to steer the skis. Studies indicate that motor control of the foot is impaired by cooling. For example cooling increased the latency of the soleus H-reÔ¨Çex (Dewhurst et al., 2005) or the ability to maintain dy- namic balance in females was reduced (Piedrahita et al., 2009). If motor control is impaired the risk of falling may be increased and with it the risk to suffer an injury. Moreover, ligaments show strong temperature dependence. Decreased temperature caused larger peak forces for similar strains (Bass et al., 2007; Woo et al., 1987). More falls and affected mechanical properties of ligaments may be an explanation for the reported increase in knee injuries at low ambient temperatures for female skiers (Ruedl et al., 2011). In our study Ô¨Årst signs of negative thermal and pain sensation appeared when the temperature at the toe dropped to about  Please cite this article in press as: Hofer, P., et al., Microclimate in ski boots e Temperature, relative humidity, and water absorption, Applied Ergonomics (2013), http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2013.07.007

In this way the skin surface would stay dry and comfort sensation may be maintained for a longer period (Fauland et al., 2011). Overnight drying of the liners is necessary to avoid reduction of the thermal resistance of the ski boot. For this it is recommended to take off the liner from the shell or use a ski boot dryer. Otherwise complete drying is unlikely due to the restricted water vapour permeability of liner and shell. The presented results were based on a limited number of sub- jects. Therefore, only descriptive statistic was presented. However, the results provided valuable insight on temperature, relative hu- midity, and water absorption in the ski boot. Further tests are required to conÔ¨Årm the results.  5.  Conclusion   Temperature decrease inside the ski boot as well as perceived thermal and pain sensation revealed the importance to pre- vent cooling of the feet and in particular of the toes during skiing.  Ambient temperature and moisture inside the ski boot affected strongly foot temperature.  High water content in socks and liner very likely reduced the thermal insulation properties of socks and boot.  Waterproof shells in which snow and water cannot penetrate are recommended.  Complete overnight drying of the liner is essential. The liner should be taken off the shell or the use of a ski boot dryer is recommended.  Liner materials with high water absorption capacity and hy- drophobic socks are suggested to keep sweat and melted snow water as far away as possible from the foot.

According to Enander et al. (1979) hands and feet start feeling cold at Ô¨Ånger and toe temperatures around 25  C and discomfort from cold was noted at temperatures below 20e21  C. A strong perception of cold and pain corresponded with foot temperatures below 20 (Luczak, 1991). Similar temperature thresholds were referred in other studies (Kuklane, 2004; Kuklane et al., 1998; Tochihara et al., 1995). We measured the toe with 11 C which was occa- the lowest temperatures at sionally referred as numbness by the subjects. Holm√©r et al. (2003) and Kuklane (2009) reported that numbness develops at around 7 C and that the risk to suffer cold injuries increases. This indicates the importance of cold protection of the toes during skiing. The results revealed relative humidity values up to 78% in the ski boots and water absorption in socks and liners up to 10 g during the climate chamber tests. Low relative humidity values at the dorsum in comparison to the other sensors were measured. This may be explained by the higher water absorption capacity of the material in the dorsum zone compared to the foot bed. With values up to 93% and 45.5 g relative humidity and water ab- sorption respectively were considerably higher during skiing than in the climate chamber. This is likely due to the penetration of snow in the ski boot with subsequent melting during skiing whereas in the climate chamber the water absorption was caused only by sweating. However, high values of moisture reduce the thermal insulation of shoes (Kuklane, 2009; Kuklane et al., 2001; Kuklane and Holm√©r, 1998) and of ski boots (Heus et al., 2005). Kuklane et al. (1998, 1999, 2009) showed that thermal insulation reduction of the footwear depends on the sweat rate, the penetration of snow or water, the evaporatione condensation rate, the absorption capacity of the footwear ma- terials, moisture transport in it and environmental conditions. The measured temperature decrease during skiing and in the climate chamber may be due to the increase of moisture in the ski boot with subsequent gradually reduction of the thermal insulation. Based on this study it is important to prevent cooling of the feet and in particular of the toes during skiing. Ski boots possess quite good thermal insulation properties (Fauland et al., 2011) but the shell is not snow proof causing an increase of the thermal conductance and a breakdown of the thermal insulation (Fauland et al., 2011; Heus et al., 2005; Kuklane, 2009; Kuklane et al., 1999). The development of shells in which snow and water cannot penetrate would improve the situation. However, due to the Ô¨Çexing movement of the ski boot during skiing it is difÔ¨Åcult to avoid the penetration of snow and water through little gaps between shaft and lower boot. Another solution is to reconsider the basic assembly of liners in order to improve their moisture management. Water absorption and distribution inside the liner are mainly determined by water absorption capacity and water transport properties of the liner‚Äôs materials, as well as by the rate of sweating and the penetrated snow or water. For liner and sock material used in this study insulation and moisture management properties were studied by Fauland et al. (2011). Based on this information and literature data (Haudek and Viti, 1978) on water absorption capacity of the used material the formation of liquid water can be avoided when a higher share of water absorbing material is used. The amount of water take up will be the lowest in case of synthetic materials and the highest in case of hygro- scopic wool (Li et al., 1992). In a previous study we suggested as possible improvement to construct the liner so that sweat and potentially melted snow water are kept as far away as possible from the foot. For this the outer layer of the liner should have a  Please cite this article in press as: Hofer, P., et al., Microclimate in ski boots e Temperature, relative humidity, and water absorption, Applied Ergonomics (2013), http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2013.07.007

s0003687013001488,"  Numerous careers require individuals to conduct difÔ¨Åcult visual searches; for example, radiologists search medical images for ab- normalities, and airport security screeners search luggage for contraband. Accuracy for these tasks is critically important, as any errors could result in fatalities, and career searchers are trained to detect target items with as few errors as possible. Nevertheless, radiologists, airport security screeners, and other highly trained professional searchers still regularly miss targets. As such, a pri- mary goal in applied visual search research is to identify the causes of search errors with the ultimate goal of improving accuracy and performance (Clark et al., 2013). Visual searches conducted by professionals often present a number of signiÔ¨Åcant complexities. One particular difÔ¨Åculty arises because search arrays can contain more than one targetda medical image could contain multiple abnormalities (e.g., a tumor and a fracture), and a suitcase X-ray could contain multiple banned items (e.g., a water bottle and a gun). Research in academic radiology has investigated the challenges associated with searching for multiple targets and identi- Ô¨Åed a phenomenon known as ‚Äúsatisfaction of search‚Äù (SOS; Smith, 1967), the idea that observers tend to be less accurate in detecting a  * Corresponding author.

Clark).  second target after having identiÔ¨Åed one target in a display (see Berbaum, 2012; for a review). The SOS phenomenon was originally believed to result from an early termination of search, assuming that an observer was ‚ÄúsatisÔ¨Åed‚Äù with the meaning of the display after the identiÔ¨Åcation of one target and discontinued searching (Tuddenham, 1962). However, further research suggests that this is not the pri- mary cause of SOS because observers do continue to search after detecting one target (e.g., Berbaum et al., 1991). Instead, the decline in second-target accuracy may arise because of attentional disruptions related to the identiÔ¨Åcation of the Ô¨Årst target and the depletion of available cognitive resources (Cain and Mitroff, 2012), resulting in faulty decision-making (Berbaum et al., 1998) or faulty pattern recognition (Samuel et al., 1995). Most investigations of SOS have used radiologists as participants and medical images as stimuli (Berbaum, 2012), but recent experi- mental work in cognitive psychology has used non-professional par- ticipants and precise manipulations of simpliÔ¨Åed stimuli (e.g., Fleck et al., 2010) to understand the nature of multiple-target visual search more generally (e.g., Cain et al., 2011; Cain and Mitroff, 2012; Fleck et al., 2010). Non-professional participants who search simpliÔ¨Åed displays demonstrate decrements in second-target accuracy paral- leling those seen in radiology, revealing that SOS is a generalizable search phenomenon and not speciÔ¨Åc to the radiological community. Furthermore, multiple-target search paradigms can be a useful means for investigating the impacts of nuanced cognitive processes; contextual factors such as anticipatory anxiety (Cain et al., 2011) and time pressure (Fleck et al., 2010) can have substantial effects on  0003-6870/$ e see front matter √ì 2013 Elsevier Ltd and The Ergonomics Society.

K. Clark et al.  / Applied Ergonomics 45 (2014) 528e533  529  single-target  second-target accuracy without altering accuracy for searches. Exploring how multiple-target search accuracy can be improved is critical because most professional searches occur in settings where multiple targets are possible, and errors can have a tangible and direct impact on health and national security. The goal of the current study is to investigate whether the structure under which searchers complete their tasks can affect accuracy. Both radiologists and airport security screeners conduct series of searches as part of their jobs, but they do so under different constraints: Radiologists typically operate with a Ô¨Åxed objective (e.g., assigned to assess 45 mammography images), while airport security screeners are scheduled to search for a Ô¨Åxed duration (e.g., scheduled to serve as an X-ray screener at the passenger checkpoint for a 30-min period). Both radiologists and airport security screeners are trained to maximize accuracy and, in effect, should be attempting the same processdcarefully examining each display for potentially harmful targets, regardless of the number of cases yet to be scanned or the amount of time left before the end of a shift. However, it is well known that the conceptual framework of a situation can dramati- cally alter behavior. For example, a substantially larger proportion of respondents are likely to support a medical program if presented in terms of the proportion of lives saved rather than proportion of lives lost, despite identical results between the conditions (e.g., Tversky and Kahneman, 1981). Given that contextual factors (e.g., anticipatory anxiety and time pressure) can have negative effects on second-target accuracy in a multiple-target visual search (Cain et al., 2011; Fleck et al., 2010), we hypothesized that the frame- work under which an individual searches could also potentially alter performance. SpeciÔ¨Åcally, we tested whether there are dif- ferences in accuracy when a search is completed within a task structure similar to radiology (searching with a Ô¨Åxed objective) versus airport security screening (searching for a Ô¨Åxed duration). To address this question, we tested non-professional participants using a version of an established multiple-target search task with simpliÔ¨Åed stimuli that has reliably induced the SOS effect (e.g., Fleck, et al., 2010) and demonstrated sensitivity to environmental contexts (e.g., Cain and Mitroff, 2012; Clark et al., 2011). Professional and non- professional searchers tend to produce comparable patterns of multiple-target errors (Biggs et al., 2013); however, it is important to account for potential differences in motivation between these groups in order to compare their search behavior. Undergraduate research par- ticipants may not be as concerned with their accuracy as radiologists and airport security screeners, for whom an error could have fatal conse- quences. Since assessing goal-relevant performance is only meaningful if individuals are truly attempting to attain the goal (Locke and Latham, 1990; Erez and Zidon, 1984), and monetary incentives offer a simple means to strengthen goal commitment (Locke et al., 1988), we provided a performance-based monetary incentive to increase the likelihood that the participants would genuinely attempt to achieve the instructed task goals. Related work using this motivational structure and the same multiple-target search task found enhanced accuracy in Ô¨Ånancially motivated versus non-motivated conditions (Clark et al., 2011). In the current experiment, we compared multiple-target search accuracy among participants searching with a Ô¨Åxed objective versus a Ô¨Åxed duration.1 Two groups of participants completed an experimental search paradigm in which they accumulated points  1  The paradigm employed here is meant to approximate the nature of searches conducted by radiologists and airport security screeners, but key manipulations are necessarily altered. For example, the Fixed Objective structure is similar to radio- logical searches, but true radiological searches use a ‚ÄúFixed Trials‚Äù structure, as immediate accuracy information is not feasible. A ‚ÄúFixed Trials‚Äù condition would have substantially altered the strategy such that speed would be irrelevant.  for accurate searching and were informed that the individual who achieved the ‚Äúbest‚Äù performance out of a set of 10 participants would receive an additional $50 in compensation. The paradigm was identical in each of the two conditions except for the frame- work of the participants‚Äô task goal: In the Fixed Objective condition, participants were to achieve a speciÔ¨Åed number of points as quickly as possible; in the Fixed Duration condition, participants were to accumulate as many points as possible during a speciÔ¨Åed number of minutes. For the Fixed Objective condition, ‚Äúbest‚Äù was deÔ¨Åned as the individual who achieved the speciÔ¨Åed points goal in the shortest number of minutes; for the Fixed Duration condition, ‚Äúbest‚Äù was deÔ¨Åned as the individual who achieved the highest number of points in the speciÔ¨Åed time period. Importantly, the two conditions were structured such that the optimal strategy in both was iden- ticaldto maximize one‚Äôs rate of point accumulation.  2. "
s000368701300149x,"  Motion sickness is a well-known phenomenon not only when traveling, but also in virtual environments. In the latter case, mo- tion sickness typically occurs in the absence of real physical motion, thus, motion sickness in simulators, cinemas, video-games, or vir- tual reality is usually referred to as being visually induced. Typical symptoms during an acute phase of visually induced motion sick- ness1 include, but are not limited to, pallor, cold sweat, dizziness, disorientation, fatigue, or nausea. The genesis of VIMS is not fully understood. Arguably the most prominent explanation for VIMS is described by the sensory conÔ¨Çict theory (Reason, 1978; Oman, 1990). Following this approach, a mismatch between or within the visual, vestibular, and/or the proprioceptive system is the origin of VIMS. For instance, users of Ô¨Åxed-base driving or Ô¨Çight simulators frequently experience the illusion of self-motiondso-called vection (see Hettinger, 2002; for an overview)dalthough they remain physically unmoved. Thus, the signals delivered by the visual system (indicating vection) and  * Corresponding author.

If this visual-vestibular mismatch is unfamiliar to the user VIMS might occur as a poten- tial side-effect. Note that for good reasons, the sensory conÔ¨Çict theory has been discussed controversially over the past years. Alternative approaches include the sensed vertical hypothesis (Bles et al., 1998), the postural instability hypothesis (Riccio and Stoffregen, 1991), or the eye-movement theory (Ebenholtz, 1992). Unfortunately, none of these theories is capable of explaining all nuances of the multi-faceted nature of VIMS, hence, the precise genesis of VIMS still remains ambiguous. Despite the lack of a profound theory, several countermeasures against motion sickness and VIMS do exist. A variety of drugs have been tested over the past years (for an overview see Sherman, 2002; Shupak and Gordon, 2006), and two drug classes have gained special popularity, namely antihistamines and anticholin- ergics (Hoyt et al., 2009). Antihistamines (e.g. meclozine, cyclizine, or promethazine) are designed to inhibit histaminergic H-receptors and might affect the H1-receptors in the vestibular nuclei (Golding, 2006). In contrast, the purpose of anticholinergic substances is to block muscarinic receptors in the brain and to subdue the input from the vestibular organs to the vestibular nuclei. Currently, scopolamine is probably the most common anticholinergic medi- cation used against motion sickness (Murray, 1997; Sherman, 2002).

522  B. Keshavarz, H. Hecht / Applied Ergonomics 45 (2014) 521e527  or cognitive impairment e frequently occur and pose a serious limit to the application of anti-motion sickness drugs. Note that most drugs have been designed to ease classical, travel-related motion sickness. It remains uncertain whether such drugs can also be assessed to successfully diminish VIMS. For instance, Furman and Marcus (2009) showed that rizatriptanda tryptamine-based drug used to treat migrainedcan reduce classical motion sickness but is less effective in preventing VIMS. Additionally, several behavioral techniques have been intro- duced in the past to counteract both motion sickness and VIMS. The most efÔ¨Åcient method to prevent VIMS is adaptation or habituation, respectively. VIMS typically subsides in most people with repeated exposure to the same nauseating stimuli (Cowings and Toscano, 2000; Young et al., 2003; Cheung and Hofer, 2005). Although some behavioral techniques have delivered promising results, they come at a price or may be impractical in many situations. For instance, adaptation to VIMS is very time-consuming and cost- intensive, hence, it is not the method of choice in many cases. Yen Pik Sang et al. (2003a) highlighted the role of music as a potential countermeasure against classical motion sickness that does not have the disadvantages outlined above. The authors asked their participants to perform head movements in off-vertical di- rections during full-body rotation along the earth-vertical yaw- axis. This procedure typically causes Coriolis effects and is known to be highly nauseating. Relaxing background music turned out to signiÔ¨Åcantly prolong the onset time of motion sickness compared to a control group that did not listen to music. However, several questions were left unanswered. The authors used physical movement to create motion sickness, but did not focus on VIMS. Also, the music was only introduced after the onset of sickness symptoms. This could have been later than optimal, as motion sickness can rapidly increase once the Ô¨Årst signs appear. Further- more, the authors analyzed the onset delay of MS rather than its magnitude. Finally, the effect of several types of music and the relation between the music‚Äôs pleasantness and its effect on VIMS has not been addressed. Thus, the aim of the present study was to determine the effec- tiveness of different music types as suitable countermeasures against VIMS. We exposed our participants to a nauseating video of a bicycle ride and either added relaxing (instrumental music), neutral (mainstream pop music), or stressful music (fast speed electronic music). A control group received no music. We assumed that relaxing music would effectively reduce the severity of VIMS compared to stressful or no music. Additionally, gender was added as further factor as previous research showed higher VIMS-reports for women compared to men (Flanagan et al., 2005; Klosterhalfen et al., 2005).  2. "
s0003687013001506,"  People with physical disabilities either due to chronic sickness or aging or some other reasons have to spend a large part of time in a seated posture or conÔ¨Åned to wheelchairs (Ng et al., 2011). Due to their physical difference with the non-disabled, the physical access issue and the lack of available transport, their participation in daily activity and communication is usually obstructed (Chang et al., 2009; Reid et al., 2001). Even the daily living activities, such as dressing and undressing, are difÔ¨Åcult for the disabled and are required to seek the help of others (Kumar, 1997). For those stroke survivors who use wheelchairs, dressing and bathing are the most common self-care problems for them (Reid et al., 2001). Some researchers have pointed out that people with physical disabilities Ô¨Ånd it difÔ¨Åcult for them to obtain suitable clothing (Thoren, 1997; Chang et al., 2009). Their clothing needs individual adaption. The reason, as is accounted for by Thoren (1997), is that most of the disabled do not Ô¨Åt into the current size system, i.e. their body dimensions differ from those represented in the size system.  * Corresponding author.

E-mail address:  For the disabled people, anatomical changes will occur, such as their spines curve forward (Ng et al., 2011) and their body heights decrease (Civitci, 2004), either due to the long-time seated posture or aging (a big proportion of disabled people, especially the wheelchair users are the elderly). Also previous studies have compared the anthropometric characteristics of the disabled with the able-bodied and have found the difference between these two groups (Goswami et al., 1987; Lucero-Duarte et al., 2012; Das and Kozey, 1999). For the disabled people appropriately dressed individuals had bigger chance at job acquisition than those inappropriately dressed persons (Christman and Branson, 1990). Another study has indi- cated that the redesign of wheelchair users‚Äô clothing can help reduce the physical strain and work load of their personal helpers (Nevala et al., 2003). Therefore, it is meaningful and beneÔ¨Åcial to design disabled people oriented clothing to meet their physical demand, as well as psychological demand. In this study, a set of new functional clothing for the wheel- chair users were designed. Much attention was paid to their daily living activities, i.e. dressing and undressing, going to toilet and bathing. An evaluating system deriving from rehabilitation med- icine and sports tournament was introduced to assess the new functional clothing. It was hypothesized that the newly designed clothing could facilitate the wheelchair users‚Äô daily living activities.  0003-6870/$ e see front matter √ì 2013 Elsevier Ltd and The Ergonomics Society.

Y. Wang et al.  / Applied Ergonomics 45 (2014) 550e555  551  2. Methodology  2.1. Questionnaire programme  Clothing designs should be user oriented to meet the end users‚Äô consuming need. It should provide protection and comfort and should offer values such as self-esteem, respectability, status and conÔ¨Ådence, etc. (Rosenblad-Wallin, 1985). Hence, questionnaires were distributed to 58 interviewees, including men and women, to know about their needs and preferences on the clothing. They all had an experience of using the wheelchairs. The results of the questionnaire survey were summarized as follows. First, pants with easy dressing and undressing function were required. Second, the location of the joints should be given more design consideration for easy limb movement. Third, soft and water absorbent fabrics with the property of keeping warm were preferred.  2.2.  Functional clothing design  Based on the results of the interview, a set of new functional clothing for the wheelchair users was designed (Fig. 1) and atten- tion was paid to the above three requirements. Liners and extra layers were added at the body regions of the head, the lower back and the knee, since these areas need higher insulation to keep warm. The upper clothes had a hood to keep the head warm. At the inner side of the elbow darts were designed and the outside were pleats. This design feature could give the elbow more Ô¨Çexibility to move. Soft and water absorbent knitted fabrics were used for the clothing. Thick polyester woven fabrics were used for the extra layers at the elbow.  In order to facilitate the wheelchair users to go to toilet, a special design of the crotch was made (Fig. 2). Zippers were used to con- nect the front part of the belly and the back part of the buttocks to make a whole pants. This special design could either be installed or detached to facilitate toileting and cleaning. If a toilet pot was placed under the wheelchair with a special cushion that could be opened into two halves, just open the zippers of the pants, the users could go to toilet without their personal helpers lifting them from the wheelchair.  2.3.  The evaluating system  2.3.1.  The usage of  the degree of difÔ¨Åculty  In sports tournament the degree of difÔ¨Åculty was commonly used for assessing how difÔ¨Åcult sports programmes could be completed. One sports programme comprised of several move- ments and each movement was given a value of difÔ¨Åculty. Then the degree of difÔ¨Åculty of one sports programme was calculated. In the study, the degree of difÔ¨Åculty was introduced for accessing the activities of daily living (ADL). It was calculated according to formula (1):  D ¬º  ŒµiP √∞Œµi √û  (1)  Where, D is the degree of difÔ¨Åculty; Œµi is the value of the difÔ¨Åculty of P √∞Œµi √û is the value of the difÔ¨Åculty of one activity one movement; which includes several movements. It is the sum of the values of all the movements. In the study, the value of difÔ¨Åculty of one move- ment related with the clothing was obtained by asking the wheelchair users to give values for each movement. The 58 in- terviewees were invited again for this purpose. The level of competence of wheelchair users coping with ADL could be calculated as follows:  L ¬º D1  k √æ D2  k √æ . √æ Dn  k  (2)  Where, L is the value of the competence of coping with the ADL; Di is the degree of difÔ¨Åculty of one movement; k equals 1 if the wheelchair users can complete the movement by themselves, otherwise it equals 0.  2.3.2.  The usage of  the modiÔ¨Åed Barthel  index (MBI)  In rehabilitation medicine the competence of the activities of daily living is used for the evaluation of the recovery of the patients. The most commonly used index for evaluating the competence of ADL is Barthel index (BI) and the modiÔ¨Åed Barthel index (MBI) (Mahoney and Barthel, 1965; Shah et al., 1989). In this study, 5 levels were used for evaluating the competence of the wheelchair users in handling the ADL (Fig. 3). From Level 1 to Level 5 the wheelchair users had an increasing difÔ¨Åculty in coping with the ADL. Each level was given a value to  Fig. 1. The design of the new functional clothing.

552  Y. Wang et al.  / Applied Ergonomics 45 (2014) 550e555  2.4.  Subject wear trials  Six wheelchair users were recruited for the subject wear trials (Goldman, 2005). The purpose of the study was briefed to them. Consensus of participating in the study was obtained from the wheelchair users themselves and their carers. Their basic infor- mation was listed in Table 2. Each subject had to try on two sets of clothing. One was the newly designed functional clothing. The other was a set of normal functional clothing that was available on the market (Control). The crotch in the control garment could not be detached. It was integral to the trousers. The experiment was randomized to diminish the effect of order. It was carried out in room temperature of 20  C and 65% RH (Fig. 4). The subjects came to the laboratory with their carers. All the subjects were moved to the same wheelchair that was prepared by the researchers of the study. This wheelchair had a special seat which could be opened to halves to form a hole. If a toilet pot was placed under the seat the wheelchair users could sit in the wheelchair without being lifted upward for toileting. The subjective sensations including the thermal sensation and the tactile sensation were evaluated by subjective ratings. For instance, for the skin wetness sensation a rating scale was used ( 2 ¬º dry,  1 ¬º slightly dry, 0 ¬º neither wet nor dry, 1 ¬º slightly wet and 2 ¬º wet). The time of their movements related with ADL was also recorded.  3. Results and discussion  3.1.  The degree of difÔ¨Åculty of  the ADL  The degrees of difÔ¨Åculty of the movements of the ADL rated by the wheelchair users were listed in Table 3. It could be seen from the table that putting on and taking off the crotch were the most difÔ¨Åcult movements in the three ADL items. Particularly when going to toilet, these two movements became even more difÔ¨Åcult. The highest degrees of difÔ¨Åculties were observed at this activity, 0.529 and 0.471, respectively. Hence, the special design of the crotch could be useful at this situation.  3.2.  The time required for the ADL  Fig. 3. Description of the ADL.  Table 1 Evaluation ratings of the ADL items.

In the table, three daily activities were quantiÔ¨Åed: dressing and undressing, bathing and going to toilet.

However, it was only 19 s when the newly designed clothing was worn, reduced by 45.7%. Further- more, when wearing the newly designed functional clothing, the wheelchair users could manage to take off and put on the crotch all by themselves without the help of their personal helpers. The six subjects were all in good health condition and their upper limbs could still function properly. With the special design of the crotch, they could open the zippers on it and go to toilet all by themselves. This could give the wheelchair users more inde- pendence of coping with the daily activity. However, with the normal functional clothing their buttocks had to be lifted with the help of their personal helpers. This required great effort not only for the wheelchair users themselves but also for their personal helpers, particularly resulting in great work load to the latter. From this point of view, the newly designed functional clothing could be beneÔ¨Åcial to reduce the work load of the wheelchair users‚Äô personal helpers. The increased independence of the pa- tients and the reduced work strain of the help givers could pro- mote the relationship between these two groups (Nevala et al., 2003).  3.3.  The modiÔ¨Åed Barthel  index (MBI)  According to the data in Table 4 and using Equation (2), the levels of competence of wheelchair users coping with ADL in the newly designed functional clothing and the normal clothing could be calculated (Fig. 5). As shown in Fig. 5, when the wheelchair users were in the normal functional clothing, their competence of managing the dressing and undressing was 75.4%. The corresponding MBI was 5  Fig. 5. The competence of the wheelchair users in managing ADL.  (Table 1). The activity of bathing was not carried out with the subject test, but the movements related with the clothing were the same as those of the dressing and undressing item. Hence, the competence of the wheelchair users of managing this activity was assumed to be equal with that of the dressing and undressing item. The competence of managing the toilet in the normal functional clothing was only 47.1%, corresponding to the MBI of 3. However, when the new designed functional clothing was worn, the competences of the wheelchair users of managing the three ADL items were all 100%. In other words, the wheelchair users could manage these three activities by themselves. Their ability of participation in the daily living activities was improved in a great extent.

Subjective sensations on the new designed functional clothing and the normal  functional clothing.  Fig. 6 shows the subjective evaluations of the newly designed functional clothing and the normal functional clothing. As could be seen in the Ô¨Ågure, the new designed functional clothing was rated higher on thermal sensation than the normal functional clothing. Since the wheelchair users were in a long time seated posture, their activity level was low and the produced body heat was low. From this perspective, warmer sensation was a positive aspect. The new clothing was looser, more air permeable and more comfortable in tactile sensory. These qualities could meet the wheelchair users‚Äô requirements on softer and more comfortable clothing. Skin wetness sensation of the newly designed functional clothing was higher than that of the normal functional clothing. The reason could be that the new functional clothing was thicker to keep the body warm and as a result sweat evaporation might be harder. This might lead to the health problem of skin ulceration or infection, which is a common problem for the long time seated and bedridden people. Since water absorbent and air permeable fabric was employed in designing the new functional clothing, the problem of wet skin could be alleviated.  4.  Conclusions  A set of functional clothing for the wheelchair users was designed. The newly designed clothing was given much consider- ation to the wheelchair users‚Äô daily living activities. An evaluating system deriving from the rehabilitation medicine and the sports tournament was described and used for assessing the new func- tional clothing. Taking off and putting on the crotch were rated as the most difÔ¨Åcult movements by the wheelchair uses. However, with the new functional clothing wheelchair users‚Äô competence of man- aging toilet was promoted by 52.9%. Their competence of managing dressing and undressing was improved by 24.6%. The time required for toilet was reduced by 45.7%. Subject wear trials indicated that the new functional clothing was warmer and more comfortable to wear than the normal functional clothing for the wheelchair users. Skin wetness sensation was higher, which might lead to health problems of skin ulceration or infection. In a word, the new func- tional clothing could facilitate wheelchair users daily living activ- ities related with clothing.  functional  clothing  on  Questionnaire users This questionnaire is prepared to carry out a study on functional clothing design for wheelchair users.

Be- sides protective clothing and boots, Ô¨ÅreÔ¨Åghters are also equipped with heavy self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBAs), which contains either steel or carbon cylinders. It is known that exposure to high environmental temperatures during heavy physical activity represents an additional burden to the cardiovascular system, as it causes an increase in the core body temperature, blood pressure (BP), heart beat frequency and respiration rate. Protective clothing that prevents burns during Ô¨ÅreÔ¨Åghting operations also diminishes the dissipation of thermal energy that is produced during extreme physical strain (Barr et al., 2010). Shift work, including night shifts and often overtime work, is related to disturbances in the circadian rhythm of Ô¨ÅreÔ¨Åghters, which leads to increased prevalence of obesity and hypertension. Published data pointed out a sudden cardiac event as the number one cause of death in Ô¨ÅreÔ¨Åghters, suggesting that 45% of all deaths reported during Ô¨ÅreÔ¨Åghting tasks are due to the cardiovascular disease (Kales et al., 2009), with  * Corresponding author.

Furthermore, according to the recently pub- lished review article by Kales et al. (2009), BP was elevated in approximately 75% of workers employed in different emergency services in the USA including Ô¨ÅreÔ¨Åghters and police ofÔ¨Åcers. Legislation that regulates physical and cardiovascular Ô¨Åtness differs across countries around the world (Kales et al., 2009). In Croatia, there are no obligatory tests that would assess the car- diovascular response to physical and thermal strain or precisely deÔ¨Åne the mandatory weight limits or the body composition. Also, data on the prevalence of hypertension, excess weight and obesity, as well as the cardiovascular response to thermal and physical strain in Croatian Ô¨ÅreÔ¨Åghters are considerably scarce. Our recent study (Ljubicic-Calusic et al., 2012) tested the thermal and physical strain level in Ô¨ÅreÔ¨Åghters attending Ô¨Çashover training (FOT). FOT was recently introduced in Croatia as a simulation of the Ô¨Çashover phenomenon under controlled conditions. The Ô¨Çashover phe- nomenon occurs when surfaces exposed to thermal radiation reach the ignition temperature, and the Ô¨Åre rapidly spreads across the enclosed area. FOT aim is to train Ô¨ÅreÔ¨Åghters to recognize, under- stand and prevent this phenomenon. In order to train Ô¨ÅreÔ¨Åghters to recognise this threat in real life and work, but to avoid any un- necessary threats, these trainings are conducted by highly experi- enced instructors, the FOT containers are built according legally proscribed EU norms EN 14097-3, and all attendees had detailed instruction regarding the rules that they must abide by during the  0003-6870/$ e see front matter √ì 2013 Elsevier Ltd and The Ergonomics Society.

The results of our previous study Calusic et al., 2012) suggested that FOT induced mild hyperther- mia and consequently, physiological respiratory responses devel- oped during the exercises. The study aimed to assess and compare the arterial BP and heart rate in professional and volunteer Croatian Ô¨ÅreÔ¨Åghters and its response to thermal and physical strain during FOT.  2.  Subjects and study design  Sixty-six Ô¨ÅreÔ¨Åghters (48 professional and 18 volunteer) attending FOT, were involved in the study. The response rate was 98% for professional and 95% for volunteer Ô¨ÅreÔ¨Åghters. All of the subjects were male. The study was approved by the Ethics Com- mittee of the Institute for Medical Research and Occupational Health, Zagreb. Potential participants were informed about the study aim, procedures that would be undertaken, research meth- odology and the obtained results‚Äô implications. FireÔ¨Åghters willing to participate signed an informed consent form prior to their in- clusion in the study. FOT procedure was described in detail previously (Ljubicic- Calusic et al., 2012). BrieÔ¨Çy, Ô¨Çashover simulator consists of two 14-gauge steel walled chambers: the burn module and the obser- vation module. At the point of auto-ignition of smoke layer, the to above 1000 C in the burn module and to temperature rises 200 C in lower parts of the observation module. Three instructors and no more than 12 attendees were simultaneously present in the simulator, either sitting on low benches or kneeling in the obser- vation module. Attendees were instructed to change their positions by moving closer to the burning module. Average temperature was measured at the attendees‚Äô protective clothing surface: 136.2  18.9 C (range 115e160  C) was measured on the clothes of those closest to the burning module and 79.0  7.9  C (range 72e 85  C) on the clothes of those farthest away. During the FOT course, attendees were exposed to extreme conditions in the Ô¨Çashover simulator four times during one day: for 20 min during the 1st, 2nd and 3rd exercise and for 30 min during the 4th exercise. The at- tendees and instructors were equipped with SCBAs containing either steel or carbon cylinders. The total weight of the protective equipment was approximately 30 kg. All of the included subjects had to respond to a medical questionnaire, undergo measurements of tympanic temperature, pulse and systolic and diastolic BP before FOT and after each of the four exercises.  3. "
s000368701300152x,"  Work-related musculoskeletal disorders (WMSDs) consist of a group of conditions that affect the muscles, skeleton, cartilage, ligaments and nerves, resulting in pain and functional impairment. These disorders are induced or aggravated by work and the cir- cumstances of its performance (Staal et al., 2007). WMSDs repre- sent a widespread occupational health issue, and contribute to sick leave, reduced productivity, reduced quality of life and premature retirement from the workforce (√Ökesson et al., 1997; Burke et al., 1997; Mohl, 1998; Woolf and √Ökesson, 2001). Work involving prolonged static postures may be a signiÔ¨Åcant risk factor for WMSDs (Keyserling, 2000). Sustained muscle activity, especially of Type I motor units, is likely to be an aetiological factor of these conditions (H√§gg, 1999; Veiersted et al., 1993). Human muscles are not well adapted to continuous long-lasting contractions, but require rest periods to recover from even very low-level exertion (Sj√∏gaard et al., 1985). It has also been suggested that during low in- tensity contraction, especially when the contraction imposed is static and long-lasting, muscle tissue may display changes in blood Ô¨Çow (Larsson et al., 1999), contractile activity (Jaspers et al., 1999; Larsson et al., 1990), and eventually changes in morphology (moth eaten Ô¨Å- bres, ragged red Ô¨Åbres and zones lacking activity) (Lindman et al., 1990, 1991). Tissue damage during these sustained contractions may be  * Corresponding author. Tel.: √æ64 3 479 5852; fax: √æ64 3 479 7070. E-mail address: doreenyng@gmail.com (D.

Moreover, mechanisms akin to local noci- ceptor sensitisation can play a role in the pathogenesis and escalation of this condition via postulated feedback loops (Simons, 2004). There is some evidence which points to a gender difference in musculoskeletal disorders (De Zwart et al., 2001). Female workers have been reported to suffer more from upper extremity musculo- skeletal disorder than their male counterparts (Treaster and Burr, 2004). WMSDs among female workers have been reported in various occupational groups such as among newspaper employees (Bernard et al., 1994), salespeople (Skov et al., 1996), or dentists (Marshall et al., 1997). The reason for these gender related differ- ences is unknown. Biological factors such as a smaller cross- sectional area of the trapezius muscle and greater amount of Type I muscles Ô¨Åbres in females have been claimed as reasons for these gender differences (Lindman et al., 1990, 1991). One hypothesis could be that differences in muscle activity between sexes may account for this gender difference (Nordander and Ohlsson, 2008). The trapezius and sternocleidomastoid muscles are frequently involved in a large proportion of WMSDs associated with the upper extremity (Buckle and Devereux, 2002). The trapezius muscle spans the upper trunk and shoulder girdle, linking the shoulder and neck. It has a signiÔ¨Åcant role in supporting and stabilizing the scapula for task-oriented work, and in movements of the upper limb relative to the axial skeleton (Brinckmann et al., 2002; Jensen et al., 1999). The trapezius is the most reported muscle in upper body WMSDs (Sommerich et al., 2000; Visser and van Die√´n, 2006).  0003-6870/$ e see front matter √ì 2013 Elsevier Ltd and The Ergonomics Society.

Ng et al.  / Applied Ergonomics 45 (2014) 556e563  557  Both the trapezius and sternocleidomastoid are also anatomically superÔ¨Åcial muscles, and therefore readily accessible to surface elec- tromyography (EMG). Quantitative EMG analysis of these muscles has been previously used to assess the activity patterns of workers in the natural work environment (Kleine et al., 1999; Mathiassen et al., 2003), as well as to compare the activity pattern of workers suffering from neck pain with healthy workers (Johnston et al., 2008; Szeto et al., 2009). Nonetheless, there are no data describing the amount of effort exerted by neck and shoulder muscles during a variety of postural tasks that are commonly observed in vocational activities. The intensity of muscle contraction can be estimated using surface EMG and then expressed as percentage of the activity produced during maximum voluntary efforts (Konrad, 2005; Netto and Burnett, 2006). Normative data are needed in order to interpret contraction levels of these muscles collected in a natural work environment and from there, to further investigate any possible causal links between muscle hyperactivity and WMSDs. To the best of our knowledge, no previous research has investigated contraction levels of the trapezius and sternocleidomastoid muscles across a broad spectrum of standardized postural tasks in healthy subjects. The aim of the present study was to assess the activity level of the sternocleidomastoid (SCM) muscle and upper trapezius (UT) muscle during static postures under controlled and standardized conditions. Effort was made to investigate a large number of tasks that reproduced static postures commonly seen during seated work. In addition, it was hypothesized that the muscle activity levels would differ between male and female participants.  2. "
s0003687013001531,"  The occupational exposure to extreme thermal environments, either hot or cold, represents an issue that should be duly consid- ered due to the very signiÔ¨Åcant number of workers involved. Based on a Ô¨Åeld survey carried out in Portugal, this work is dedicated to the study of cold thermal environments. The occupational cold exposure, assessed in terms of the Required Clothing Insulation Index (IREQ) (ISO 11079, 2007) developed by Holm√©r (1984), was Ô¨Årst characterized by Oliveira et al. (2008) in an extensive study that has quantiÔ¨Åed the thermal conditions of six activity sectors mainly in food production, conservation and distribution industrial units. This study, based on the IREQ index, shows that in Portugal the number of people working in cold environments is much more important than was initially predicted. However, it is widely recognized that the activities developed in both moderate and extreme thermal environments should be evaluated from multiple perspectives and subjective assessments are being looked at with growing interest.

Yasuo et al. (2010) performed a cross- sectional study involving 991 workers in 126 kitchen facilities in Japan to evaluate subjective thermal strain in different working environments using a self-reporting questionnaire survey and subjective judgment scales. The interrelationships of subjective assessments (thermal sensation, perceptions and preferences for individual and climate parameters) as well as their connections with the prevailing thermal conditions were analyzed through in- terviews to 967 visitors of Szeged, Hungary, by K√°ntor et al. (2012). Arezes et al. (2013) tested thermal comfort of trekking boots through objective and subjective evaluations and Boschman et al (2013) assessed the psychosocial work environment and mental health among construction workers using a questionnaire. The importance of the subjective surveys is also raised by international standards, namely in the case of cold thermal environments (ISO 15743, 2008; ISO 28802, 2012). The increasing awareness of the importance of this tool lead the authors to a new and detailed approach that resulted in an addi- tional study focused in a subjective assessment of the occupational exposure to cold thermal environments. Hence, the present contribution represents a complementary analysis of a previous study (Oliveira et al., 2008) but the aim is now restricted to food distribution industrial units. Despite being focused on Portuguese workers, the present analysis can be of potential interest and  0003-6870/$ e see front matter √ì 2013 Elsevier Ltd and The Ergonomics Society.

regarded as a valid contribution to other countries and industrial activities. The present survey was carried out in large and medium size supermarkets owned by an important economic group, which has been formally invited to participate in this study and has imme- diately accepted and encouraged the project. This active coopera- tion included the participation of all the industrial units of the group distributed all over Portugal main land. This full cover of the territory and the participation of 61 industrial units turned into the Ô¨Årst large characterization of the working conditions through in- dividual questionnaires.  2. "
s0003687013001555,"  A signiÔ¨Åcant part of manual work is still done using hand-tools, therefore a correct design is crucial for preventing upper extremity acute trauma disorders (ATD) and cumulative trauma disorders (CTD), such as blisters, carpal tunnel syndrome, hand-arm vibration syndrome, tendonitis, etc (Moore et al., 1991). When considering the ergonomics of the hand-tool, besides its main functionality, the most important aspect is the tool‚Äôs handle. It has been shown, that a correctly designed handle can provide safety, comfort, and increased performance (Eksioglu, 2004). The broad variety of powered and non-powered hand-tools seems to have blunted the desires of many authors to research the topic of tool-handle design. They have provided guidelines and mathematical models for  * Corresponding author. Tel.: √æ386 2 220 76 93; fax: √æ386 2 220 79 94. gregor.harih@um.si (G.

It has been shown that ATD and CTD, which are caused by badly designed hand-tools, account for about one third of workers‚Äô sick leaves, resulting in workers‚Äô compensations claims (Punnett and Wegman, 2004; Tanaka et al., 1997, 1995). Several researchers have paid a lot of attention to hand-tools in terms of perceived discomfort/comfort, since it is strongly corre- lated with user performance (Kuijt-Evers et al., 2007). Comfort is affected by physical, physiological, and psychological factors, and is subjectively deÔ¨Åned by feelings, which differs from subject to subject (De Looze et al., 2003). Therefore designers have to opti- mize the human/product interaction in order to reduce the discomfort (Kuijt-Evers et al., 2004). The feeling of discomfort whilst using a hand-tool can reduce the efÔ¨Åciency of the task, and user‚Äôs satisfaction. The reduction of discomfort is mainly possible by optimising the functionality of the hand-tool, and the physical  0003-6870/$ e see front matter √ì 2013 Elsevier Ltd and The Ergonomics Society.

It has been also shown that great correlation exists between physical and psycho- physical properties of the materials which are in touch by the users (Wongsriruksa et al., 2012). Most authors have focused on the sizes and the shapes of the tool-handles, but neglected those materials of the handles that are in direct contact with the user‚Äôs hand. It has been shown that successful choice of product material is critical for success of the whole product on the market (Ljungberg and Edwards, 2003). Authors provided basic guidelines regarding the material choice, but did not investigate and consider the mechanical behaviour of the skin and soft tissue whilst grasping handles of different materials. Skin and subcutaneous tissue are highly complex structures, therefore their material properties are hard to measure and deÔ¨Åne. The mechanical properties of skin and subcutaneous tissue have been extensively investigated by many researchers (Clark et al., 1996; Edwards and Marks, 1995; Pan et al., 1998; Wan Abas, 1994; Wilhelmi et al., 1998; Wu et al., 2007a; Zheng and Mak, 1996). It has been shown, that skin and subcutaneous tissue have non-linear viscoelastic properties, where the skin is stiffer than the subcu- taneous tissue. Both have low stiffness regions at small strains fol- lowed by a substantial increase in the stiffness when the strain increases. Brand and Hollisters‚Äô (1999) rough guidelines are pro- vided for the maximum suggested pressure versus time application over bony prominences. The recommended guidelines are for designing medical splints, but can also be used for designing and analysing hand-tools. It has been shown that higher contact pres- sures than allowed for a speciÔ¨Åc time can result in discomfort, pain, and ischemia which can lead to ATD and CTD. A power grasp can yield a contact pressure of the Ô¨Ångertip of 80 kPa or over, which is excessive loading for skin and subcutaneous tissue (Gurram et al., 1995). It has been shown that hand-tools which require high grip, push, pull or torque exertion on the handle produce high contact pressures, which is known to be one of the primary factors for the development of ATD and also CTD (Eksioglu, 2004; Radwin et al., 1987; Rempel et al., 1992; Riedel, 1995). However some authors have argued that higher contact area can lower the subjective comfort rating, since higher contact area triggers more pressure sensors in the soft tissue (Goonetilleke and Eng, 1994; Xiong et al., 2011). Therefore the designer has to Ô¨Ånd the optimal contact area which can increase the subjective comfort rating and lower the risk of ATD and CTD which are contact pressure induced. Aldien et al. (2005) provided rough guidelines of pressure discomfort (PDT) and also pressure-pain threshold (PPT), where PPT is higher than PDT and values differ by the area of the hand. Also different subjects reported different values due to subjective perception of the load on the hand. The PDT limit of 188 kPa has been reported by Aldien et al. (2005), however Fransson-Hall and Kilbom (1993) estimated the value as 104 kPa. In order to maintain the desired user performance, the designer has to design tool-handles, which distributes contact pressure more evenly and do not exceed the PDT limits (Aldien et al., 2005). According to Ô¨Ånite element simulations performed in by Wu and Dong (2005), it has been shown, that the surface curvature has a big inÔ¨Çuence on the resulting contact pressure on the Ô¨Ångertip when in contact with an object. Those objects that follow the shape of the hand and the skin‚Äôs surface result in much lower contact pressures and local deformations of the skin and subcutaneous tissue, which can prevent discomfort and several disorders. A power grasp-produces a very uneven distribution of forces and, therefore, also pressure on the hand and Ô¨Ångers. Fellows and Freivalds (1991) showed that foam rubber grip can be used to provide more uniform distribution of forces and pressures. Due to the deformations of the foam rubber, the test subject applied higher grip forces to the foam rubber grips than those grips of stiff  materials. This can be attributed to the fact that the excessive deformation of the foam whilst gripping the handle can produce a ‚Äúloss of control feeling‚Äù. This effect can be attributed to the used thick foam of 4 mm in this study, which most likely allowed excessive deformation whilst gripping the tool handle. The authors also do not provide any material properties of the foam tool handle material. Despite the Ô¨Ånger forces were higher, the subjects preferred the foam rubber grips. Finite element (FE) method is computationally intensive and in terms of decision-making a very challenging method that is used to predict the behaviour of observed structure (continuum) consid- ering particular load and boundary conditions (Dolsak and Novak, 2011). It can be used for a wide range of simulations from com- mon structural problems to more speciÔ¨Åc problems, such as for example the analysis of a tool wear in manufacturing process, simulating additive manufacturing technology, welding, etc. (Deng et al., 2013; Edwin Raja Dhas and Somasundaram, 2013; Tamizharasan and Kumar, 2012). FE method has also been used many times to successfully model, compare and evaluate material choice in the design phase of a product (Novak, 2012). Deformations and stresses that represent basic results of the structural analysis using FE method are also an important aspect in the Ô¨Åeld of ergo- nomics. Many authors have shown that composites can be suc- cessfully simulated in order to deÔ¨Åne appropriate material and product design especially in the safety industry (Coelho et al., 2013). Therefore due to the lack of investigation into the choices of materials regarding tool-handles and their potential to increase comfort rating, user performance, and lower the risk of pressure dependent ATD and CTD, we investigated the mechanical contact interaction between a Ô¨Ångertip and composites of rubber and hyper-elastic foam materials using the FE method, and compared them to the traditional materials used in tool-handle design. We modelled the cross-section of a male human Ô¨Ångertip and simu- lated a contact using various hyper-elastic foams and rubber ma- terials. Based on the Ô¨Åndings from FE analysis, material parameters for tool-handle grips are proposed in this paper. Therefore tool- handles with material properties deÔ¨Åned based on Ô¨Ångertip grip simulation can lower the contact pressure and thereby also the risk of pressure dependant ATD and CTD. Additionally, the methods allow the designer to set the material parameters to reach the desired rate of the stability while grasping the tool-handle.  2. "
s0003687013001579,"  Many newspapers are currently changing from large format (Broadsheet) to a smaller format (Tabloid or Berliner). In the UK, this has already taken place with the London Times, The Independent (both to Tabloid) and the Guardian to the Berliner format. The Broadsheet is the largest format and has generally been associated with ‚Äòquality‚Äô newspapers. The Tabloid format is also known as a ‚ÄòCompact‚Äô format by former Broadsheet newspapers in order to avoid the stigma associated with tabloid journalism (Rowe, 2011). The change to smaller formats is also happening in other countries. For example, the two major Australian broadsheet quality newspapers, the Sydney Morning Herald and the Melbourne Age, changed to the Compact format in March 2013. Their weekend papers are, however, still produced in the Broadsheet format. This change in weekday format occurred even though a survey of 14,000 readers voted 47% to retain the Broadsheet format, while 29% voted for the Tabloid and 10% for the Berliner format (SMH, 2012). However, in their Ô¨Årst issue with the compact format (3rd March 2013), it is described how ‚Äú100 readers were asked to read both broadsheet and compact versions of the newspapers in real-life conditions for 10 min while wearing specialised head caps‚Äù.  * Corresponding author.

These head caps had 80 electrodes that ‚Äúpick up on subtle measures of brain activity which indicated levels of engagement, emotional intensity and memory encoding, or what is committed to memory. Combined with eye-tracking technology . the neurological testing revealed how engaged readers were with the papers. The compacts were found to be more engaging than the broadsheets (page 20). Similar changes from large to smaller formats are happening in other parts of the world; in Switzerland the Blick has changed from Broadsheet to Tabloid (Stone, 2012); in Germany there is a compact version of Die Welt (Welt Kompakti). A review of the changes that are occurring in the newspaper industry is given in the proceedings of ‚ÄúThe Future of Newspapers Conference‚Äù (2007). Newspapers that are produced in two size versions have in recent years found reader preference for the smaller format, with increasing sales of the Tabloid format compared with the Broad- sheet format. This has occurred with the Irish Times (Slattery, 2012). Similarly, of London offered readers both Tabloid (Compact) and Broadsheet formats for nearly a year, with the only difference lying in their sizes. It was found that most readers opted for the Tabloid format because of its convenience in size (News Corporation, 2005). Considering all newspapers in the UK, the average daily circulations of the tabloid newspapers are much higher than that of the broadsheet papers (Newspaper Marketing Agency, 2013). Reasons for publishers making the change of format are not always clear: Smaller formats give more convenient handling of the paper and are more popular with the younger population of readers, are several reasons that have been given.

572  S.N.H. Tsang et al.  / Applied Ergonomics 45 (2014) 571e576  Constanze (2005) found that Tabloid format made more efÔ¨Åcient use of paper than Broadsheet format did, as the time readers spent per square centimetre was 47% higher for tabloid spreads. Down- sides appear to be the shorter article lengths and the decrease in size for advertising. It is this latter that is of concern to publishers as advertisement sizes are decreased and hence income to the newspaper may be reduced. Besides, it was reported that the bigger the size of the advertisement the better the readers see, like and remember it (Lundqvist and Holmqvist, 2001). Sales of the news- paper may also be affected and opinions seem to be divided on the effects of size change as, in some cases, there have been increased sales with the smaller format, while others have reported decreased sales (Stone, 2012; Slattery, 2012; Future of Newspapers Conference, 2007). There does not appear to be any published information on hu- man preferences for newspaper size, although it is likely that there is in-house research (as noted above for the Sydney Morning Herald and the Melbourne Age) made when a change of format is considered. The reader survey published in the Sydney Morning Herald is far from scientiÔ¨Åc (as stated in the newspaper) as it is a vote of readers that was carried out on-line. Thus the aim of the present research was to attempt to determine if there are differ- ences in the preferences in newspaper size of a reader population and attempt to correlate the preferences with the geometric size of the newspapers.  each format, the articles were identical, although they were distributed in a different manner. In order to eliminate any effects of different weights of paper, the smaller formats had more pages so that the overall weight of the papers was close to constant. A sample newspaper is shown in Fig. 1 in the Rhensch format. The newspapers were produced with both Chinese and English articles to allow a larger range of participants. The newspaper name ‚ÄòFestival Daily‚Äô arises from the location of City University near the Festival Walk shopping centre.  2.2.  Participants  Two separate groups of participants were tested; 143 in a comfortable environment (no interference from adjacent persons) and 140 in cramped environments where there was the possibility of interference due to adjacent persons. If participants were to avoid interference, cramped postures and discomfort in the reading environment resulted. Of the 143 participants in the comfortable environment, 77 were male and 66 female. Ages in this group ranged from 22 to 52, with a median of 29 years. The cramped group consisted of 98 males and 42 females with ages ranging from 20 to35, with a median of 22.5 years. Age and gender were not of speciÔ¨Åc interest in this study and hence participants were selected on the basis of their willingness to take part in the experiment.  2. Method  2.3.  Testing locations  Newspapers are read in a number of different environments, which may affect the preference for a particular size. For example, reading a Broadsheet while sitting in a cramped or crowded envi- ronment such a train or caf√© may be quite difÔ¨Åcult in terms of holding the paper to a comfortable reading distance, turning the pages and avoiding interference with adjacent persons. That same newspaper may be quite easy to read and control when in an un- crowded environment such as sitting on a comfortable lounge. Thus we need to consider the type of environment when investi- gating participant preference for newspaper size.  2.1. Newspapers  We tested Ô¨Åve ‚Äòstandard‚Äô sizes of newspaper, Broadsheet, Rhensch, Tabloid, Tall Tabloid and Berliner. The sizes of these newspapers were taken from Wikipedia, Newspaper format‚Äô where it is noted that the sizes may vary slightly between different pub- lishers. The sizes we used are given in Table 1. Newspapers were produced in-house to each of these sizes by reproducing articles from Hong Kong newspapers and placing these into templates of the required size. By this means we generated ‚Äòreal‚Äô newspapers that were then printed so as to appear very much as a genuine paper. This allowed a real reading experi- ence for the participants in the experiment, using articles about news and advertisements with which they would be familiar. With  Table 1 Newspaper page sizes used in the experiment. Width is with paper folded. Sizes are taken from Wikipedia.

The main environments were cafes and coffee bars where there was seating in a number of arrangements, some in close quarters with other customers, others where there was ample room for spreading of the newspaper. These locations were around the University area where there is a very large shopping centre (Festival Walk). Participants were approached and asked if they would be willing to take part in the study. They were informed of the purpose of the study and the methods that would be employed. Most participants expressed, and maintained, interest in taking part in the experiments.  2.4.  Testing techniques  Two approaches were used to determine subjective preferences for newspaper size:  (i)Rating scales as shown in Table 2, using a nine-point scale with 12 statements related to the use of the newspaper. These statements related to the physical and visual comfort of using the paper as well as difÔ¨Åculty in several aspects of use. (ii)A method of paired comparisons was used in order to develop a scale of preference using Thurstone scaling, Case V (Edwards 1983). This method makes several assumptions that can be tested, the most important of which is that the prefer- ences can be modelled on a single linear scale. A second important assumption is that the standard deviations of all the distributions of preferences are similar. Using this method, and the interval scale of preferences produced, it was possible to determine the geometrical factors of the newspaper size (height, width, area) that are related to the scale values.  2.5.  Procedure  In each case, the paired comparisons were Ô¨Årst performed, fol- lowed by the rating scales. There were 10 possible pairings of the

Following experience with each of the paper sizes, the partici- pants then Ô¨Ålled out the scales for each of the 12 statements of Table 2.

Data analysis and results  3.1.  Subjective rating scales  Mean data, averaged over all subjects are shown in Table 3, where the numerals in the left-hand column refer to the statements in Table 2. A Factor Analysis of the responses to the subjective rating scales, using Varimax rotation, was performed. A scree plot indi- cated that three factors needed to be considered, both for the cases of comfortable and uncomfortable viewing of the newspaper. The Factor Analysis gave the following results:  3.1.1.  Comfortable environment  Factor 1: 3, 5, 7, 9, 10 (40.9%); Factor 2: 1, 2, 4 (23.5%); Factor 3: 11 (21.9%). These factors accounted for 86.4% of variance. The Ô¨Årst factor is related to physical comfort; the second to the reading comfort and the third factor to the ease of folding pages.  3.1.2. Uncomfortable environment  Factor 1: 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10 (59.6%); Factor 2: 1 (11.9%); Factor 3: 11 (11.3%). The three factors accounted for 82.8% of variance. The Ô¨Årst factor relates to all forms of comfort when holding and reading the paper; the second to adequacy of the size of the paper and the third factor to the ease of folding pages. There were factors common to both reading environments. Physical comfort in each case was the dominant factor, related to the difÔ¨Åculty of holding the paper; in each case the ease of folding the paper was also of importance in these ratings.  3.2. Newspaper size preferences  Results for the preferences are shown in Table 4 for both reading environments. Here the preferences are for the column papers relative to the row papers. For example, reading from this table, it is seen that the Rhensch format is preferred relative to the Broadsheet on 83 of the 143 presentations in the Comfortable environment.  Table 4 Number of preferences of newspapers listed in left-hand column over the news- papers listed in the upper row. The Ô¨Årst value in each cell (in italics) is for Comfortable locations (N ¬º 143); followed by the preference for uncomfortable/ cramped locations (N ¬º 140). Leading diagonal is assumed to have equal numbers of preference when a paper size is compared to itself.  Broadsheet  Rhensch  Tabloid  Tall tabloid  Berliner  Broadsheet Rhensch Tabloid Tall Tab.

The resulting scales are interval, with an arbitrary zero. Placing the least preferred paper at a scale value of zero, all others may be scaled relative to this value. The results of this scaling are given in Table 5 for the Comfortable and Uncomfortable reading environments. The analysis showed an average discrepancy of .032 between the theoretical proportions predicted by the model and the actual values in the case of the Comfortable environment and .039 in the case of the Cramped environment. A chi-square test to determine whether the actual and theoretical proportions were in accord yielded a value of c2 (6) ¬º 7.71 (NS, comfortable) and c2 (6) ¬º 125 (Cramped). The Uncomfortable case has a signiÔ¨Åcant chi-square, indicating a lack of Ô¨Åt to the Case V model of Thurstone. Thus data for the Uncomfortable case were recalculated using the Case III model (Edwards, 1983) which takes into account the differing variances of the mean preferences. The assumption that all the newspaper preferences lay along a single dimension appears to be valid for the Comfortable case, but not for the cramped reading case in the Case V analysis. The Case III analysis produced a change in the preference ratings of the Tabloid, Tall Tabloid and Berliner papers. The differences in standard deviations in the Comfortable case, as seen in Table 5, did not affect the Ô¨Åt to the Case V model of Thur- stone. The values for the Uncomfortable environment for Case III analysis are those shown in Table 5. Mean preference values are shown in Fig. 2. Using the mean preferences and standard deviations given in Table 5, the signiÔ¨Åcances of differences (using t-tests) between the various preferences have been calculated and listed in Table 6. In the case of the comfortable environment, only four of the 10  Fig. 2.

However, when in the Un- comfortable environment, all comparisons are signiÔ¨Åcantly different. This difference between preferences is clearly seen in Fig. 2, for each of the two reading environments.  3.3.  Relationship between scaled preferences and paper sizes  Regressions between preference values and geometric charac- teristics of the newspapers are presented below. These regressions were initially done with a stepwise method and, in each case, the only variable entered was the area of the newspaper (height  width), measured in m2. For both Comfortable and Un- comfortable conditions, Area accounted for 86% of variance. In re- gressions in which height and width were entered, only the width of the sheet was signiÔ¨Åcant, in each case accounting for 81% and 76% of variance. Thus the overall size of the newspaper was shown to be signiÔ¨Åcantly related to the preference for newspaper size, with the width accounting for the major part of the preference values.  Comfortable preference ¬º :73   3:28√∞Area√û;  r2 ¬º :86  Comfortable preference ¬º 1:32   :00345√∞Width√û;  r2 ¬º :81  Uncomfortable preference ¬º 4:07   17:6√∞Area√û;  r2 ¬º :86  Uncomfortable preference ¬º 7:12   :0181√∞Width√û;  r2 ¬º :76  3.4.  Relationship between preferences and ratings  Stepwise regressions were carried out to determine which of the ratings (Table 2) were related to the preferences for the different newspapers.  Comfortable preference ¬º 2:64   :33√∞1√û   :19√∞8√û;  r2 ¬º :99  In this equation, the numbers (1) and (8) refer to the statements in Table 2. The two terms accounted for 97% and 2% of variance, respec- tively. Statement 1 is related to the ‚Äúadequate size of the news- paper‚Äù. Thus, as preference for this case is also dependent mainly on the area of the newspaper, it appears that, when the environ- ment is comfortable, it is just the paper overall size that determines the preference for the paper.  Uncomfortable preference ¬º  13:0 √æ 1:80√∞7√û √æ :93√∞4√û;  r2 ¬º :99  Here the two terms accounted for 95% and 4% of the variance. Statement 7 is due to a physical fatigue ‚ÄúThe paper can be held for an extended period‚Äù. Statement 4 is that ‚ÄúThe paper is awkward to read‚Äù. Thus, in a cramped or uncomfortable environment, it is the size of the paper (particularly the width as seen in the above re- gressions) that determines the ratings for the paper size.  4. Discussion  With many daily newspapers now changing from Broadsheet to the smaller Compact (Tabloid) format, the question was asked whether there is some difference in comfort and preference of readers when reading newspapers of different sizes, particularly when reading in different physical environments. This is apparently the case as experiments showed a clear preference for the smaller format sized paper. In both comfortable and uncomfortable environments, the rank order of ratings for newspaper size was the same: from least preferred to most preferred, this order was Broadsheet, Rhensch, Berliner, Tall Tabloid and Tabloid. It should be noted, however, that the study did not consider long-term comfort. In each case of comparison, the participants were holding each newspaper for only a matter of minutes. This might be considered ‚Äòbrowsing‚Äô rather than a form of reading that required high attention levels. It is not known if preferences may be different when long-term reading is done; it is however considered unlikely as the data show similar effects for both environmental conditions. Data (Fig. 2) show that the critical case for determining prefer- ences for newspaper size is that of the uncomfortable environment as would be found on a train, in a crowded restaurant or other lo- cations where there is limited ability to extend the arms. In the uncomfortable environment, the participants used a much wider range of preferences than in the comfortable environment e these are illustrated in Fig. 2. Most of the variance for regressions be- tween preferences and newspaper size is accounted for by the width of the paper, with area of the paper also being an important variable. It appears that there is good reason for the change in newspaper sizes that are now occurring e reader‚Äôs preferences give a strong relationship to the smaller formats. All of the participants in these experiments were randomly approached in environments such as coffee lounges or cafes, where it was possible to select people who were (i) working/ eating within the required environment and (ii) were willing to take the time to participate. Thus the groups are not necessarily balanced in terms of age or gender. In some cases, participants started the tests with enthusiasm but, as time went on, some tired of the tests and tended to hurry with their ratings. This is a lim- itation of the selection of participants and environments that is difÔ¨Åcult to avoid. The Factor Analyses were essentially in agreement in the two reading environments, with the comfort variables being of major importance in both cases. These analyses showed that newspaper size was a major factor in determining reading comfort. Anthropometric factors were not measured in this study due to the difÔ¨Åculty and possible embarrassment caused in crowded public environments. Such data would have assisted in interpre- tation of data of comfort. Data such as full arm spread, arm spread available in the different environments, location of grip on the paper, arm spread actually used while reading and vertical location of the hands relative to the thighs would help such an analysis. However, even without this anthropometric data, we do know that there was a wide range of body sizes of participants and that was one major aim in selection of participants.  5.  Conclusion  In both comfortable and cramped reading environments, the small format Tabloid (Compact) newspaper is the most preferred size for reading. Ratings and preferences indicate that the size of the paper, and largely the width, is the major determinant of reading comfort.

s0003687013001671,"  The last European Working Condition Survey reports an expo- sure of 63% of the working population to repetitive hand or arm movement, and 46% of the population mentions painful, tiring positions for at least one quarter of the working time (Fifth European Working Conditions Survey, 2010). Indeed, the preva- lence of occupations involving physical labor has not changed over the last 20 years in Europe. The risk factors implicated in the development of work-related musculoskeletal disorders (WMSD) are commonly divided into internal and external risk factors (Sj√∏gaard et al., 1995). Individual factors like age, gender, Ô¨Åtness level, and personality are known as internal risk factors. The external risk factors are expressed in terms of physical and psy- chosocial components. A relatively Ô¨Åxed erect posture, repetitive arm movements, heavy work, insufÔ¨Åcient rest, vibrations as well as static posture are recognized important physical factors contrib- uting to WMSD (Winkel and Westgaard, 1992; Sj√∏gaard et al., 1995), which are often reported in the neck-shoulder of butchers (OSHA,  * Corresponding author. E-mail address: pm@hst.aau.dk (P. Madeleine).  2007). Stress and pain behavior have also been identiÔ¨Åed as some of the important psychological risk factors. Thus, the presence of internal and external risk factors emphasizes the complex etiology of WMSD. Further, the relationships of the risk factors do not facilitate the evaluation of the impact of ergonomic interventions. Musculoskeletal simulation enables to address this issue as the load over a region of the musculoskeletal system can be evaluated during an ergonomic intervention aiming at reducing the occur- rence of WMSD. Musculoskeletal simulation is of particular interest when designing a workstation. Such approach is cost effective as it enables to address most of the physical risk factors without the need for human testing prior to the prototype stage. Moreover, musculoskeletal simulation processes a large number of biome- chanical parameters (kinematics, kinetics, muscle forces). In com- parison, bipolar surface electromyography (EMG) recordings only provide temporal aspects of the level of activation from the studied muscle. However, EMG recording are still often performed in er- gonomics for such purpose (Madeleine et al., 2011). Thus, musculoskeletal simulation offers undeniable advantages when evaluating the design of a workstation. Finally, adjustments of the workstation to the worker can be done easily and may result in a gain of time and money (Weidlich et al., 2009).  0003-6870/$ e see front matter √ì 2013 Elsevier Ltd and The Ergonomics Society.

C. Pontonnier et al.  / Applied Ergonomics 45 (2014) 592e600  593  A pre-requisite for using musculoskeletal models for the work- place evaluations is that the predictions of the internal loads are correct. The validations of musculoskeletal simulations are often made by comparison of EMG signals recorded during the task; see for example de Zee et al. (2007). The qualitative validation is based on comparison of the shape of the recorded and computed acti- vation patterns (Erdemir et al., 2007). In ergonomics, a quantitative evaluation of the internal loads is crucial when the design param- eters are changed. A quantitative validation of the loads predicted by the musculoskeletal model can be done with objective criterions such as the difference between the work performed by internal and external forces or curve comparison metrics in magnitude (Lund et al., 2012). The validation can also be done by comparing the trends followed by the computed and recorded activation of the muscles as a function of design parameters (Pontonnier et al., 2011). This latter approach is of particular interest as the trends followed by the muscle activation provide direction to optimize the design of the workstation. To the best of our knowledge, quantitative vali- dation by trend analysis is still rarely used in ergonomics. The present study aimed at Ô¨Ålling this gap by validating a musculoskeletal model of the upper limb for standardized meat cutting task. Validation of such models makes it possible to provide ergonomic guidelines in a workstation design process. We opted for a simulated meat cutting task similar to the one presented by Madeleine et al. (1999) to test a musculoskeletal model in relation to workplace design. For that purpose we analyzed and compared the trends followed by computed and recorded activation of the muscles during repetitive arm movement as a function of change in cutting direction and in the height of the workbench. The trend analysis of the recorded EMGs has been previously reported (Pontonnier et al., 2012), but not compared with the computed EMGs.  2. Materials and methods  2.1.  Experimental protocol  Seven male subjects (mean age  sd: 29  5 years old, height: 182  8 cm, weight: 77  16 kg) participated in the present study. Informed consent was obtained from the subjects prior to the re- cordings. All participants reported no pain in the shoulder region prior  to the experiment and had no history of neck-shoulder disorders. The study was approved by the local ethics committee (No. N-20070004) and conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. An illustration of the experimental set-up is depicted in Fig. 1. The subjects were standing in front of a workbench. The workbench height was set at 4 different heights: 0,  10,  20, and  30 cm. The 0 cm height corresponded to the subject‚Äôs elbow height and is the recommended height for light work (McCormik and Sanders, 1987). Two main directions of cutting were used, i.e.: 1) arm Ô¨Çexion, and 2) a combination of internal arm rotation and abduction. These directions were chosen to simulate real slaughterhouse work sit- uations observed in the meat industry (Madeleine et al., 1999). The subjects were asked to perform cutting tasks in these two di- rections for 20 s at each workbench height. The cycle combined a static postural phase (holding), a cutting phase in direction 1 (di- agonal slot), and a cutting phase in direction 2 (horizontal slot). The recordings consisted of 4 sequences over 20 s in each trial. A practice period was performed to teach the subjects to apply a resultant force of approx. 50 N in agreement with the forces measured during a real meat cutting task (Juul-Kristensen et al., 2002; McGorry et al., 2003).  2.2. Data acquisition  The collected data consisted of cutting forces, kinematics data, and surface EMG data. A trigger was used to synchronize the mo- tion capture, cutting force, and EMG acquisition, using an End-of- Frame signal starting from the motion capture markers.  2.2.1.  Cutting force acquisition  The main part of the literature analyzing the cutting force exerted during meat cutting is based on relatively simple force assessment as only a one-dimensional force was measured (Madeleine et al., 1999; Juul-Kristensen et al., 2002). However, assessing the cutting forces in 3D exerted by the worker offers advantages. McGorry (2001) has designed an advanced knife instrumented with strain gauges to record reactive forces and grip moments. In our study, a 3D force registration was necessary to perform a 3D inverse dynamics analysis of the task. Thus, 3D cut- ting forces were recorded using a newly designed 3D instrumented  Fig. 1. Experimental situation showing the instrumented knife, bipolar EMG electrodes, and the active markers for the assessments of the cutting forces and movement in 3D. Motion capture markers were placed on standard anatomical landmarks. The resulting cutting force was measured mainly in the (y, z) plane, and lateral bending effects appeared in the x direction.

The design of the knife is based on the instrumentation of a 3D force sensor (FS6-2000, AMTI, Watertown, MA, USA). The re- action forces applied to the transducer were recorded (Fig. 1). The blade had the shape of a real knife considering that only the tip of the blade is used during a cutting event. The blade thickness avoided bending issues during the cutting task. The knife had to be handled as a real knife, i.e. the handle diameter was similar to knives used in the Danish slaughterhouses. A tennis grip was added to facilitate grasping. The knife was approximately 0.5 kg heavier than knives used in Danish slaughterhouses. The mass difference was due to the use of the 3D force sensor and was taken into ac- count in the simulation (see below). Force signals were low-pass Ô¨Åltered (10.5 Hz) and ampliÔ¨Åed 2000 times. The signals were A/D converted and sampled at 60 Hz (12 bits A/D converter, Nidaq 6024, National Instruments, Austin, TX, USA) and recorded through a custom made program in LabView 8.2 (National Instruments, Austin, TX, USA), which also provided feedback on the applied forces to the experimenter.  2.2.2. Motion acquisition  The motion was captured using an active marker motion capture system (Visualeyez II√î system set up with two VZ4000 trackers, Phoenix Technologies Inc., BC, Canada). Sixteen active markers were used to collect trunk, right arm, and knife motion. Kinematics data were sampled at 60 Hz. The missing markers were interpo- lated using a rigid body hypothesis. Finally, 3D coordinates were low-pass Ô¨Åltered (5 Hz).  2.2.3.  Surface EMG acquisition  Four bipolar channels were used to collect EMG from the deltoideus medialis, deltoideus anterior, biceps brachii, and triceps long head (Fig. 1) with bipolar surface electrodes (Neuroline 720, Ambu, Denmark). A reference electrode was placed on the C7 spinal process. The bipolar surface electrodes were aligned (inter-elec- trodes distance: 2 cm) on abraded ethanol-cleaned skin along the direction of the muscle Ô¨Åbers. The bipolar electrodes were placed with respect to anatomical landmarks following the recommen- dations (SENIAM, 1999). The EMG signals were ampliÔ¨Åed 2000 times (128-channel surface EMG ampliÔ¨Åer, LISiN-OT Bioelectronica, Torino, Italy) and sampled at 2048 Hz. The signals were full-wave rectiÔ¨Åed and low pass Ô¨Åltered (4 Hz) to obtain the absolute linear envelope of the muscle activation proÔ¨Åles.  2.3.  Inverse dynamics analysis  right arm similar to the one developed by Rasmussen and de Zee (2010). The model was built in the AnyBody Modeling System (AnyBody Technology A/S, Aalborg, Denmark). The principles and the mathematical details behind the software are described in Damsgaard et al. (2006). The musculoskeletal model has 52 degrees of freedom, 135 muscle actuators, and is based on the data by Van Der Helm (1994). The model is available at the AnyBody Managed Model Repository.1 The musculoskeletal model is scaled to Ô¨Åt the morphology of the subject, and marker positions are optimized to Ô¨Åt real landmarks using an optimization routine described by Andersen et al. (2010). The 3D cutting force was then used to deÔ¨Åne the external forces applied to the model, and mass and inertia properties of the knife were taken into account in the simulation. Ten s of each trial were simulated, discarding the Ô¨Årst and last 5 s. An inverse dynamics method was used to generate the muscle forces from kinematics (Fig. 2). The objective function used for the muscle recruitment step was a standard quadratic criterion:  (1)  min f ¬º  Xn  j ¬º 1       !2  Fj  t  F max  j  j  Fmax  Where Fj(t) is the current muscle force of muscle j at the time t, and the maximum isometric force that muscle j can produce. We used the maximum isometric forces reported in Van Der Helm (1994). The muscles are described as simple actuators as shown in this equation:  Fj √∞t√û ¬º aj √∞t √û$F max  j  (2)  Where aj(t)  is the muscle activation with 0 corresponding to no  activation and 1 to maximal activation.  2.4. Validation processing & statistics  The validation process consisted of qualitative and quantitative comparisons of recorded and computed activation of the muscles. The ranges of motion were also computed to assess inter-subject variability. Fig. 3 shows the global processing scheme used to validate the simulation. Qualitative comparison of the recorded and computed activa- tion of the muscles was performed by computing a normalized cross-correlation between both the surface EMG signals and the corresponding estimated force trajectories (computed). The  The collected data were processed to drive a detailed muscu- loskeletal model based on inverse dynamics of the trunk and the  1 http://forge.anyscript.org/gf/project/ammr/.

Then, the mean√æ/ SD values corresponding to the two conÔ¨Ågurations ([Trial Height, Cutting direction 1] and [Trial Height, Cutting direction 2]) were computed for each trial. There- after, the averaged activation of the muscles was normalized for each subject with respect to a reference corresponding to a meantask normalization in agreement with Burden (2010). The chosen reference in this study was [0 cm, direction 1]. The relative varia- tions of activation of the muscles were computed as shown in Equation (3) to account for the differences in terms of duration and exerted cutting forces between the trials.  cross-correlation function is a measure of similarity of two wave- forms as a function of a time-lag applied to one of these. Between recorded and computed activation, contraction and activation dy- namics of muscles were considered to introduce a positive time-lag less than 200 ms e global contraction and activation dynamics delay (Cavanagh and Komi, 1979; van Die√´n et al., 1991). Therefore, the highest level of correlation obtained from the cross-correlation in a [0, 200 ms] positive time-lag window was considered as the real correlation between recorded and computed signals. The cross-correlation was Ô¨Årst applied to the entire simulation sequence (10 s). Then, the trials were divided into two phases: static postural phases, corresponding to an exerted force level equal to the knife weight, and the dynamic phases consisting of cutting events in the two directions. During the cutting events, increases of the exerted force were detected (framed with two minimum points at the beginning and the end of a cutting event). Then a cross- correlation was computed locally for each phase to assess possible discrepancies of the model behavior with respect to the trial phases. The correlations between signals were obtained using the same time-lag as explained above (10 s sequence). Cross- correlation values were then averaged per subject and workbench height. Further, to compare quantitatively computed and recorded activation of the muscles, a trend analysis was conducted associ- ating the cutting phases and workbench heights. The trends computed for the recorded EMG have been previously reported in Pontonnier et al. (2012). In the current study, the trends were computed from the musculoskeletal simulation and then compared with the recorded trends. After division into phases, the recorded and computed activation of the muscles was averaged for each  8>>>< >>>:  com ¬º i jRk i  j Ak com  a 0  1 Ak  com  $i  j  rec ¬º i jRk i  j Ak rec  $i  j  1 Ak  rec  0 1 Ak  com  a 0  0 1 Ak  rec  (3)  jRk com and i j Rk jAk  Where i rec were the relative variations of the computed activation i com and the recorded activation i rec of muscle k in the [Height i, Direction j] conÔ¨Åguration, respectively.

596  C. Pontonnier et al.  / Applied Ergonomics 45 (2014) 592e600  The relative variation was computed for each subject and aver- aged among subjects. Spearman‚Äôs correlation coefÔ¨Åcients were then calculated between series of recorded and computed relative variations for each subject and among subjects. The range of motion (ROM) of elbow Ô¨Çexion, shoulder abduc- tion, shoulder Ô¨Çexion, shoulder internal rotation, and wrist Ô¨Çexion during the cutting phases was extracted from the kinematics data. This provided information on the adopted motor control strategies. Finally, the resultant cutting force and cutting task duration were also computed. The ranges of motion, resultant cutting force, and cutting task duration were analyzed using a full factorial repeated measure analysis of variance with workbench height and cutting direction as independent factors.  3. Results  3.1. Overview  Fig. 4 shows the resultant cutting force and the recorded and computed activation of the muscles for subject 4 (workbench height: 0 cm). The Ô¨Ågure underlines the role of prime movers, i.e. triceps and deltoideus medialis muscles during cutting events. For these two muscles, both the recorded and computed activa- tion of the muscles had similar patterns consisting of increases  during cutting events and decreases to baseline values during postural phases of the work task. The biceps brachii and deltoi- deus anterior muscles exhibited more variable patterns, but fol- lowed in general the resultant cutting force. The recorded and computed EMG signals of triceps and deltoideus medialis were in phase and corresponded to the resulting force pattern of the muscle.  3.2.  Signal correlation  Fig. 5 reports the averaged correlation coefÔ¨Åcients at workbench heights of 0,  10,  20, and  30 cm. Table 1 summarizes the cross- correlation results. The highest correlation coefÔ¨Åcients were ob- tained for the deltoideus medialis and triceps muscles. The corre- lation coefÔ¨Åcients were higher for triceps and deltoideus medialis muscles during the cutting events compared with values obtained over the entire trial (denoted Global on Fig. 5). The opposite pattern was seen for biceps brachii and deltoideus anterior. It implies that the computed activation of the muscles for biceps and deltoideus anterior corresponded better to the recorded activation during the static postural phases than during the cutting phases. Notably, subject 1 had a high correlation coefÔ¨Åcient (>0.7) during the cut- ting events in both cutting directions while the remaining subjects had a correlation coefÔ¨Åcient between 0.4 and 0.5.  Fig. 4. The results for a sample trial (subject 4, height 0 cm). The resulting cutting force recorded via the knife is shown as a time reference (divided by 100).

Trend comparison  Fig. 6 shows the recorded and the simulated trends in relation to the height of the workbench and the cutting direction. In general, the trend analysis conÔ¨Årms the results obtained from the signal correlation. The trends followed by simulated triceps and deltoi- deus medialis activation were relatively consistent with the recor- ded ones while this was seen to a lower extent for biceps and deltoideus anterior. The trend analysis provided similar informa- tion for both the recorded and the simulated muscle activation. Lower workbench height led to a decreased level of activation for triceps and an increased level of activation for deltoideus medialis. Direction 1 (diagonal slot) resulted in lower levels of activation. A slight difference appeared in the deltoideus medialis simulated trend since the simulation indicated that  30 cm height resulted in lower activation level compared with  20 cm while the recorded trends indicated the opposite. Table 2 reports the correlation between the recorded and computed trends for each subject. In most cases, no signiÔ¨Åcant correlations were found at individual level. On the contrary, a sig- niÔ¨Åcant correlation between the averaged recorded and simulated activation of the muscles was found for the triceps.  3.4.

The standard deviations were large underlining the notable differing of motions from one subject to another especially for shoulder rotation and Ô¨Çexion. Similarly, the cutting task duration and the resultant cut- ting force varied from 0.6 to 2.5 s and 18e67 N, respectively. Workbench height and cutting direction did neither signiÔ¨Åcantly inÔ¨Çuence the ranges of motion, the resultant cutting force, nor the cutting task duration.  4. Discussion  This study investigated the capacity of a musculoskeletal model to predict the relative muscle activation changes as a function of workbench height and cutting direction in a simulated meat cut- ting task. The correlation coefÔ¨Åcients found for recorded and computed muscle activation were similar while the trend analysis depicted some differences. The results indicated that the cutting movements involving arm Ô¨Çexion (direction 1) were preferable to the movement requiring internal arm rotation and abduction (di- rection 2). Furthermore, they indicated that the optimal bench height should be between 20 and 30 cm below the elbow height. This conÔ¨Årms that musculoskeletal models can be helpful for the design or re-design of a workstation involving repetitive arm movement.  4.1.  Simulating a work task in laboratory conditions  The task described here is not a carbon copy of a real meat cutting task, but it involves some of the known physical risk factors such as repetitive arm movement, strenuous, relatively short work cycle duration, and static posture (Sommerich et al., 1993; Bernard, 1997). The task was performed without time and force constraint, and this resulted in inter-subject differences in the joint ranges of motion, cutting task duration and resultant cutting forces (Table 3). The simulation of a work task in laboratory conditions enables a practical control of factors affecting the motor behavior like work organization (e.g. productivity requirements), incentive systems, the physical environment, and some psychosocial factors (e.g.  
perceived time pressure). The present study was designed to con- trol some factors like the static and dynamic phases of the cutting task as well as the order of the task (cutting events). On the con- trary, the workspaces as well as the ROM were not constrained to simulate a more real slaughterhouse task. The biomechanical as- sessments (motion capture, reaction forces, and EMG) in laboratory conditions enable the use of advanced equipment ensuring high quality recordings as noise sources (electrical, light, and tempera- ture) are controlled (Madeleine et al., 2011). All in all, our study was  intended to serve as a basis for investigating the pros and cons of a musculoskeletal model in relation to slaughterhouse work. Moreover, it should be mentioned that the population size was small, but sufÔ¨Åcient to generate new important data concerning the capacity of musculoskeletal modeling to predict relative muscle activation changes in relation to changes in the workbench height and the movement direction.  4.2. Musculoskeletal simulation and surface electromyography  The musculoskeletal models have gained in popularity in the modern era of information technology. In ergonomics, Garg and Kapellusch (2009) have summarized the possibility of 2D and 3D biomechanical models for the prevention of WMSD. The AnyBody modeling system is a practical simulation tool that can be used for example during product design and ergonomics interventions. The use of advanced 3D biomechanical models is not cost free, i.e. the recordings and processing of the motion capture and the reaction forces are demanding. Especially, this is the case when the model has to be veriÔ¨Åed and validated (Lund et al., 2012). However, the approach has also important advantages such as a complete set of muscle forces, joint angles, and joint torques is obtained. One should note that the sole use of EMG recordings in occupational  -130  160  B  i  c  n p o e  s  A  c  t  i  v  a  t  i  (  %  )  Recorded  Dir 1  Dir 2  Simulated  -80  40  T  r  i  c  n p o e  s  A  c  t  i  v  a  t  i  (  %  )  -120  170  D  a e  l  t t  A  n n o  t  A  c  t  i  v  i  (  %  )  -30  -20  -10  0  -170  570  D  a e  l  t t  M  d e n o  A  c  t  i  v  i  (  %  )  Workbench Height (cm)  -30  -20  -10  0  Workbench Height (cm)  Fig. 6.

Moreover, electrical noise can alter the quality of EMG especially in real conditions (Madeleine et al., 2011). The musculoskeletal model predicted with precision the trends of the prime movers in average, but failed at predicting individual trends. A possible explanation is that all participants were inexpe- rienced and not instructed to perform the task in a very well-deÔ¨Åned way. This resulted in a relatively large standard deviation found in the recorded activation of the muscles and kinematics parameters. As deÔ¨Åned in Mathiassen (2006) and Madeleine et al. (2008a), cycle- to-cycle variability can thus explain issues relative to individual trend predictions. If the antagonistic behavior of muscles is not accurately estimated, this will, therefore, result in an underestima- tion of the synergistic forces considering that the net joint torque remains the same. In other terms, a muscle force estimation algo- rithm based on net joint torques cannot predict accurately the muscle forces, especially when the subjects are presenting a variable motor pattern. The motor control strategies are affected by the level of experience in meat cutting tasks (Madeleine and Madsen, 2009; Madeleine et al., 2008b). A higher level of experience is reported to lead to a reduction of co-contraction levels (Gribble et al., 2003). The simulation is based on the minimization of the sum of the squared muscle activation of the muscles and does not take different levels of co-contraction into consideration (Praagman et al., 2010). It is thus conceivable that a lower extent of motor variability could lead to better individual trend predictions in accordance with the force- sharing algorithm deÔ¨Ånition. Further, the musculoskeletal model uses a standard scaling algo- rithm (Andersen et al., 2010) that does not incorporate the differences in force-sharing patterns (Praagman et al., 2010). Discrepancies in isometric maximal muscle forces (Murray et al., 2000) and variations in joint axes and centers can lead to different results of the optimization-based force sharing algorithm (Pierce and Li, 2005). The choice of simple muscle models not taking force-length and forcee velocity relationships into account can also result in quantitative er- rors (Zajac, 1989). Issues related to co-contraction and scaling of the musculoskeletal model are warranted to be addressed in future development of musculoskeletal models.  4.3. Prediction of muscle activation in relation to workbench height and cutting direction  The assessment of muscle activation showed that the computed activation of the muscles was estimated more accurately for the muscles involved in the cutting force generation, i.e. deltoideus medialis and triceps, than for the muscles involved in joint stabili- zation, i.e. biceps and deltoideus anterior. The low correlation co- efÔ¨Åcients obtained for muscles involved in joint stabilization can be directly explained by the method used to estimate muscle forces (see part 4.2). The stabilizer muscles mostly co-contracted during the  investigated task as the subjects had to maintain the knife in the slots. In line with previous studies (Gribble et al., 2003; Osu et al., 2004), co- contraction increases the joint stability and minimizes the perturbing effects of forces arising from limb movement (Osu and Gomi, 1999). More speciÔ¨Åcally, co-contraction of the biceps and deltoideus ante- rior muscles played an antagonistic role with respect to the resulting torque of the elbow (producing the cutting force). In such cases, the muscle activation is poorly estimated when using a classical inverse dynamic approach such as the one applied here (Ait-Haddou et al., 2000; Pontonnier and Dumont, 2010). During static postural pha- ses, the biceps contributes to carrying the load of the knife and be- comes synergistic. This was why the global correlation coefÔ¨Åcient was better than the cutting task correlation coefÔ¨Åcient. Two different cutting directions were investigated in the present study in line with observations from real slaughterhouse work (Madeleine et al., 1999). These different cutting directions consisted of arm Ô¨Çexion (direction 1) and a combination of internal arm rotation and abduction (direction 2). The cutting direction involving arm Ô¨Çexion was found to require lower levels of muscle activation than the cutting direction requiring both internal arm rotation and abduction. This is in agreement with our preliminary results (Pontonnier et al., 2012) and mostly in line with studies investigating the risk of shoulder disorders in relation to posture (Ohlsson et al., 1995; Punnett et al., 2000). On the contrary, no signiÔ¨Åcant inÔ¨Çuence of the cutting directions was found on the range of motion, the cutting duration, and the resultant cutting force. This can be explained by the size of the studied population (see part 4.1). The lower level of muscular acti- vation found while simulating meat cutting involving arm Ô¨Çexion is most likely of importance. The applied load is one of the well-known physical risk factors for the development of WMSD (Winkel and Westgaard, 1992; Sj√∏gaard et al., 1995). Thus, the cutting tasks involving arm Ô¨Çexion should be preferred to task requiring both in- ternal arm rotation and abduction. The muscle activation was also measured and predicted as a function of the workbench height. This type of information is important for practicing ergonomists as it provides an objective quantiÔ¨Åcation of physical load (Garg and Kapellusch, 2009). The predicted activation levels indicated that the optimal height was 30 cm below the elbow height while the measured ones showed that the optimal height was  20 cm in line with Pontonnier et al. (2012). The predicted muscle loads point towards a load transfer from triceps to deltoideus anterior when the workbench height decreased. This implies that the distribution of the muscular acti- vation is changing as a function of workbench height during a simulated meat cutting task. Similar to the cutting directions, there was no signiÔ¨Åcant effect of the workbench height on ranges of motion, cutting duration, or resultant cutting force. Our Ô¨Åndings on EMG trends indicate that the optimal height in terms of muscular load should be between 20 and 30 cm below elbow height. This is in line with the general recommendations stating that heavy work should be performed below elbow height (McCormik and Sanders,  
600  C. Pontonnier et al.  / Applied Ergonomics 45 (2014) 592e600  1987). However, the optimal height may be challenged by the fact that precision of the cuts is also a very important among butchers.  5.  Conclusion  In conclusion, this study demonstrated that a musculoskeletal model can be useful to obtain a qualitative overview of the force sharing patterns involved in the task even though quantitative estimation of muscle loads remains challenging. Cutting move- ments involving arm Ô¨Çexion are preferable in terms of biome- chanical loads to movement requiring internal arm rotation and abduction. The optimal bench height for the meat cutting task requiring force of approx. 50 N should be between 20 and 30 cm lower than the worker‚Äôs elbow height. In conclusion, musculo- skeletal models can help to minimize the risk of developing WMSD when designing or re-designing workstations.

s0003687013001695,"  Large volumes of technical documents are currently interpreted automatically not just for archiving purposes, but also so that they can be modiÔ¨Åed using computer-aided design (CAD) software. These documents include land registry maps (Boatto et al., 1992), architectural plans (Lu et al., 2005; Ahmed et al., 2011), electrical diagrams (Ouyang and Davis, 2009), road maps (Chiang and Knoblock, 2011) and even music scores (Bainbridge and Bell, 2001). The two experiments described in the present paper were part of a collaborative research project to develop retroconversion software capable of interpreting scanned plans and reconstructing them in a format compatible with all the main types of CAD soft- ware.1 Although this research will be generalizable to all types of technical documents, we chose to restrict our experiments to architectural plans. The software under development currently has a 9% retroconversion error rate for simple plans of this nature (Ghorbel et al., 2013). It will therefore be important for users to be able to identify mistakes. In some design activities, such as the creation of architectural plans, professionals often start off by producing a hand-drawn paper sketch (Bilda and Gero, 2006; Manolopoulou, 2005), which is then reconstructed in software,  * Corresponding author.

Whether we are talking about the manual copying of paper diagrams into CAD software, document retroconversion, or systems intended to beautify hand-drawn sketches of industrial parts (Ku et al., 2006), product designs (Orbay and Kara, 2010) or architectural plans (Elsen et al., 2012), it is vital that users inspect the end product to ensure that the system has not made any errors of interpretation. He must compare the two plans: the scanned plan and the one interpreted by the system. This type of ‚Äúspot the difference‚Äù task, involving the mental integration of two distinct visual sources, raises the question of which is the best display format for ensuring that as many errors as possible are spotted.  1.1.  Processing two visual sources  The cognitive processing of architects‚Äô drawings has been explored from several angles, including their 3D visualization (Yagmur-Kilimci, 2011), the different stages in their production (Bilda et al., 2006; Manolopoulou, 2005), and variations in design strategies according to expertise (Maycock et al., 2009). To the best of our knowledge, however, there has never been any research on the cognitive processes involved in comparing such drawings, the difÔ¨Åculties that may be encountered along the way and the best ways of minimizing them. There have, of course, been a great many studies of the parallel processing of visual information sources in the Ô¨Åeld of multimedia document comprehension (for a review, see Ginns, 2006).

Jamet / Applied Ergonomics 45 (2014) 601e607  consists of an image and a text that refer to each other, presenting each chunk of text next to the corresponding area of the image, rather than simply displaying the two side by side, enhances learning performances (e.g., Erhel and Jamet, 2006, 2011; Johnson and Mayer, 2012; Mayer, 2009; Sweller and Chandler, 1994). It is generally assumed that the beneÔ¨Åcial effect of this spatial conti- guity stems mainly from a reduction in the number of times that the gaze has to travel back and forth between the two sources. This to-ing and fro-ing is widely assumed to hinder individuals by forcing them to hold information in memory (Ayres and Sweller, 2005; Cierniak et al., 2009; Chang et al., 2011). Some authors, however, have claimed that spatial contiguity actually works by making it easier to establish coreference between the visual sources (Erhel and Jamet, 2006, 2011; Holsanova et al., 2008). This claim was recently conÔ¨Årmed by Johnson and Mayer (2012), who used eyetracker measurements to demonstrate that spatial contiguity leads individuals to make more eye movements from the text to the corresponding area of the image (and vice versa) than a separated format does. The principle of spatial contiguity has been extended from learning of text and pictures documents to comparative visual search by Bauhoff et al. (2012). The research conducted by Kroft and Wickens (2002) on map comparison shed additional light on this subject. In their study, student pilots were shown two maps. One of them indicated the characteristics of the terrain (relief, power lines, etc.), while the other provided information about air trafÔ¨Åc and weather condi- tions. Participants had to answer multiple-choice questions. Some of these questions (e.g., ‚ÄúWhat is the altitude of plane X?‚Äù) only required them to process one of the maps, but others (e.g., ‚ÄúWill plane Y Ô¨Çy over a lake?‚Äù) forced them to integrate information across both of them (Kroft and Wickens, 2002). Performances on the latter were better when the maps were superimposed, rather than being displayed side by side. Here once more, the beneÔ¨Åcial effect of spatial integration was explained in terms of cognitive cost. Answering a question that concerned both maps involved three processing stages: information searching, reading and mental integration. When the maps were superimposed, the mental inte- gration stage no longer required any cognitive resources (Kroft and Wickens, 2002).  1.2.  Role of attentional guidance in document exploration  Correcting plans involves not just the comparison of multiple visual sources, but also their visual exploration. However, the na- ture of this exploration is determined by the image‚Äôs characteristics and does not necessarily take the form of systematic scanning. When individuals view an image displayed on a screen, for instance, they tend to Ô¨Åxate the centre of that image (Bindemann, 2010) and, more generally, any salient areas (for a review, see Grant and Spivey, 2003; Sch√ºtz et al., 2011). There are several methods for guiding the visual exploration of a screen, such as using motion to trigger visual pursuit (Dorr et al., 2010). This type of guidance was used in a study by Nickles et al. (2003), who found that a cursor moving across the screen improved visual search proÔ¨Åciency. According to the authors, it was the guidance afforded by the cursor that led to this improvement, by encouraging a more exhaustive exploration of the image. Tracking down errors in plans relies on precisely this sort of exhaustive exploration. Given that retroconversion software interprets documents one element at a time, one solution would be to use the realtime display of this gradual process to guide attention. This on-screen retroconversion would constitute a form of sequential display. A great deal of research has shown that when a fresh item appears on the screen, it immediately captures the viewer‚Äôs attention, triggering a saccade to that item and the allocation of processing resources (Abrams and  Christ, 2003; Craig et al., 2002; Godijn and Theeuwes, 2002; Hillstrom and Chai, 2006; Ludwig et al., 2008). Furthermore, several studies have reported improved comprehension of a multimedia document when it is displayed sequentially (B√©trancourt et al., 2001; Jamet et al., 2008; Mayer and Chandler, 2001). One explanation for these results is that sequential pre- sentation avoids perceptual and cognitive overload by ensuring that there is never too much information on the screen at any one time. Another is that it ensures that the document is explored in a more coherent order (B√©trancourt et al., 2003; Jamet et al., 2008).  2.  Experiment 1  We began by conducting a ‚Äúspot the difference‚Äù pretest, where participants had to compare two plans displayed side by side. The results of the pretest highlighted the inherent difÔ¨Åculty of this task, in that only 33% of participants managed to detect every single error. Research on multimedia documents, albeit ones combining textual and pictorial information, suggests that spatially integrating the two plans would have improved performances (e.g. Ayres and Sweller, 2005; Erhel and Jamet, 2011; Mayer, 2009). Furthermore, as mentioned earlier, Kroft and Wickens (2002) concluded in their study that integration makes it easier to answer questions requiring the combined processing of two maps. These parallels with maps and multimedia documents led us to predict that plan integration would reduce the need to hold information in memory, thereby boosting task effectiveness.2 Our second prediction was that the attentional guidance effects observed for sequentially presented multimedia documents would also be observed when the second plan in our comparison task only gradually appeared on the screen. We postulated that the sequential display mode would facilitate plan comparison by minimizing the visual search process and proposing an order of exploration which, if the participants adhered to it, ensure that each and every feature of the plan was checked. By making the mistakes easier to spot, it would ultimately improve the effectiveness of the retroconversion software prototype.  2.1. Material and method  2.1.1.  Participants  This Ô¨Årst experiment was administered to 54 participants (19 men and 35 women), students and young professionals, recruited from the basis of voluntary testers of the Observation Laboratory on the uses of information and communication technology (LOUSTIC). The youngest was aged 18 years and 9 months, and the oldest 31 years and 3 months. The participants‚Äô mean age was 23 years and 2 months (SD: 38 months).  2.1.2. Material  Participants performed the spot the difference task on an Asus Slate with a 12.100 Eee screen, examining three different plans interpreted by our retroconversion software prototype. This pro- totype is capable of recognizing all the different symbols used in hand-drawn plans, but for the purposes of our experiment, it only had to recognize walls, which it showed as black lines, doors (red boxes) and windows (blue boxes). The source document appeared on the screen at the beginning of each test, but participants were not allowed to start circling the errors until the retroconversion process was Ô¨Ånished (30e60 s, depending on the plan‚Äôs  2  In accordance with ISO usability standard 9241, efÔ¨Åciency referred to the time it took to complete the task and effectiveness to its successful completion (partici- pants‚Äô ability to locate all the errors).  
S. Fleury, √â.  Jamet / Applied Ergonomics 45 (2014) 601e607  603  separated  complexity). They had to compare three pairs of plans in succession and in one of three experimental conditions. In the condition, the hand-drawn plan was displayed on the screen and once the retroconversion process was Ô¨Ånished, the retroconverted plan was displayed alongside it, at which point the participants were allowed to circle the errors (Fig. 1). The integrated condition was very similar to the separated one, in that the retroconverted plan only appeared once it was complete. However, instead of being displayed alongside the hand-drawn one, it appeared on top of it (i.e., superimposed). In the third and Ô¨Ånal sequential condition, the hand-drawn plan was once more visible from the very outset, but this time participants could watch the retroconversion process take place in realtime, as the retroconverted plan gradually appeared on top of the hand-drawn one. The three plans were the real plans of the three levels of the building wherein there is the LOUSTIC. They were composed respectively of 11, 11 and 33 symbols. The pro- portion of errors was kept constant relative to the number of symbols and deliberately high so that the difÔ¨Åculty of the task is adequate. They contained respectively 5, 5 and 15 errors.  2.1.3.  Procedure  An architectural drawing was displayed on the screen. This drawing was then interpreted by the prototype, and the partici- pants had to circle the interpretation errors on the retroconverted plan with a digital pen. The experimenter emphasized to partici- pants that the system represented the walls as black lines, the doors as red squares and the windows as blue squares. The different types of errors made by the prototype included mistaking a window for a door, a door for a window, and a window or door for a wall. Each participant checked three different plans in the same experimental condition. The order of presentation of these plans was counter- balanced within each of the three experimental groups. We measured plan comparison effectiveness and efÔ¨Åciency.  2.2.  Results  We only compared task completion times (i.e. efÔ¨Åciency) be- tween the separated and integrated groups, for although partici- pants in the sequential group had to wait for the end of the retroconversion process before they could start circling the errors (exactly like the other two groups), they could nonetheless make a mental note of them beforehand. Accordingly, comparing task du- rations between the sequential condition and the other two con- ditions would not have made much sense. We ran Levene‚Äôs test for that homoscedasticity was met, F(1, 32) ¬º .44, p ¬º .51. An analysis of homogeneity of variance on the task completion times, showing variance (ANOVA) revealed that the task took signiÔ¨Åcantly longer to complete in the separated condition than in the integrated one, F(1, 32) ¬º 13.58, MSE ¬º 2066.42, p ¬º .001 (see Table 1). We compared effectiveness in the different conditions by establishing a contingency table summarizing the participants‚Äô success or failure on the task. This indicator was chosen because in  Table 1 Task duration (Experiment 1).  Separated Integrated Sequential  Task duration  M  228.12 170.65 103.72  SD  48.182 42.560 39.716  this type of task, the number of errors which are not identiÔ¨Åed is nearly always very low. Thus, the variance of the number of errors found is very low too. The likelihood ratio chi-square test showed that there was a statistically signiÔ¨Åcant relationship between the frequency of task success and the display condition, LR(2, N ¬º 52) ¬º 7.127, p ¬º .028. To explore this difference further, we ran a second likelihood ratio test to compare the separated and inte- grated groups on success frequency. This failed to reveal any sig- niÔ¨Åcant difference, LR(1, N ¬º 34) ¬º .48, p ¬º .48. A third likelihood ratio test compared the integrated and sequential groups. This revealed that task success was signiÔ¨Åcantly more frequent in the sequential condition, LR(1, N ¬º 35) ¬º 6.66, p ¬º .01 (see Table 2).  2.3. Discussion  In Experiment 1, we predicted that superimposing the plans would help the participants. However, our hypothesis was that the superimposition would improve the effectiveness while the results showed that it improves the efÔ¨Åciency. It took the participants signiÔ¨Åcantly less time to complete the task when the plans were superimposed than when they were displayed separately. Our spot the difference task required participants to establish links between the two plans. In the separated condition, this meant encoding visuospatial information about one of them and holding it in memory until the corresponding area could be located in the other one and the comparison made. It is surprising that the integration improves efÔ¨Åciency but not effectiveness. This result can be explained by the fact that in our study, the time to complete the task was free. Thus, the participants had the option to compensate for their difÔ¨Åculties by spending more time. In contrast, the time of consultation of the documents was limited in the experiments on the spatial contiguity like that of Erhel and Jamet (2011) or that of Mayer and Gallini (1990). Superimposing the plans did away with problems of distance and thus eliminated the stages of visual searching and active storage of visuospatial information, for when the participants in this condition looked at a given spot on the plan, they straightaway had all the information they needed to spot the potential error. This result was coherent both with Wickens‚Äô theory (Kroft and Wickens, 2002), whereby the physical integration of two visual sources of information enables individuals to dispense with the mental integration stage. Our second prediction was that the sequential display of interpreted plan would improve the participants‚Äô and thus  the the  Fig. 1.

Once again, this prediction was validated by the results, as more errors were located in the sequential con- dition than in the integrated one. We assumed that this difference was an effect of attentional guidance, for if participants chose to explore the plan in the order in which it appeared, they could be sure of checking the whole plan, which was not necessarily the case in the two static conditions. We based our interpretation of the results for this Ô¨Årst experi- ment on the assumption that Ô¨Åndings for multimedia documents could be extended to the comparison of complex visual sources. Plan comparison has much in common with the experiments conducted by Sweller and Chandler (1994), Erhel and Jamet (2011), and even Mayer and Chandler (2001), but it also differs in two important respects. First, these experiments focused on textual and pictorial content. Second, the aim of the participants in these studies was to learn the content of the documents. For both these reasons, we felt it was important to test our interpretations by conducting a rerun of same experiment, but this time with the addition of eye movement recordings.  3.  Experiment 2  The Ô¨Årst experiment enabled us to demonstrate that both plan superimposition and sequential display make it easier to spot mistakes. The second experiment replicated the Ô¨Årst one, but this time, an eyetracker was used to gain a more detailed understanding of the data. The shorter task duration we observed in the integrated condition, compared with the separated condition, had two possible explanations. The Ô¨Årst (Hypothesis 1) was that the par- ticipants wasted time due to ineffectual coreferencing. In mea- surement terms, this hypothesis led us to predict that more time would be spent looking at error-free areas than at ones with po- tential errors in the separated condition, compared with the inte- grated one. The second (Hypothesis 2) was that participants in the separated condition had to hold information in memory while they were making the comparisons, which was more time-consuming. This hypothesis led us to predict that total error Ô¨Åxation times would greater in the separated condition than in the integrated one. We attributed the more accurate pinpointing of errors in the sequential condition in Experiment 1 to attentional guidance (Hy- pothesis 3), postulating that the staggered display of items on the screen (Abrams and Christ, 2003; Craig et al., 2002; Godijn and Theeuwes, 2002; Hillstrom and Chai, 2006; Ludwig et al., 2008) encouraged participants to follow a set order of exploration that ensured that all the potential sources of error were checked. We therefore predicted that more errors would go unchecked in the integrated condition than in the sequential one.  3.1. Material and method  3.1.1.

Material  (separated,  The experimental conditions were the same as in Experiment 1 integrated and sequential). The only difference was that we recorded eye movements during the task with a Tobii T60 eye- tracker (Stockholm, Sweden) integrated in a 17-inch TFT monitor with a maximum resolution of 1280  1024 pixels. This non-touch material means that instead of circling the errors with a digital pen, participants used a computer mouse.  3.1.3.  Procedure  As in Experiment 1, participants were asked to circle any ret- roconversion errors they spotted in the architectural plans. Each participant examined the same three plans as in Experiment 1, in one of the same three experimental conditions. The order of pre- sentation of the three plans was counterbalanced within each experimental group. We measured task duration and task success. These plan comparison measures were supplemented by re- cordings of the participants‚Äô eye movements during the task.  3.2.  Results  3.2.1.  EfÔ¨Åciency  We ran Levene‚Äôs test for homogeneity of variance on the task completion times, showing that homoscedasticity was met, F(1, 32) ¬º .040, p ¬º .842. As in Experiment 1, an ANOVA on task duration by condition revealed a signiÔ¨Åcant difference between the sepa- rated and integrated conditions, F(2, 48) ¬º 11.68, MSE ¬º 2847.40, p ¬º .013 (see Table 3).  3.2.2.  Effectiveness  A likelihood ratio chi-square test highlighted a statistically sig- niÔ¨Åcant relationship between task success frequency (see Table 4) and condition, LR(2, N ¬º 51) ¬º 10.55, p ¬º .005. To explore this difference further, we ran a second likelihood ratio test to compare the separated and integrated groups on success frequency. This failed to reveal any signiÔ¨Åcant difference, LR(1, N ¬º 34) ¬º .425, p ¬º .515. A third likelihood ratio test comparing the integrated and sequential groups revealed that task success was signiÔ¨Åcantly more frequent in the sequential condition, LR(1, N ¬º 35) ¬º 9.808, p ¬º .002.

Fixation times  As a Levene‚Äôs test on error Ô¨Åxation times revealed that homo- scedasticity was not met, F(1, 32) ¬º 3.35, p ¬º .076, we tested the effect of integration on total error Ô¨Åxation times by means of the nonparametric ManneWhitney U test. This test failed to reveal any signiÔ¨Åcant difference in total error Ô¨Åxation times between the separated and integrated conditions, U ¬º 141.5, p ¬º .931 (see Table 5). Levene‚Äôs test on total Ô¨Åxation times on the error-free areas showed that homoscedasticity was met, F(1, 32) ¬º .038, p ¬º .847. We therefore ran an ANOVA to test the effect of integration on these total Ô¨Åxation times. This revealed that Ô¨Åxation times on error-free areas were signiÔ¨Åcantly longer for the separated group than for the integrated one, F(1, 32) ¬º 11.45, MSE ¬º 1653.68, p ¬º .002. As an indication, the mean number of times the participants‚Äô gaze trav- was 63.9 (SD ¬º 23.97), that is, one back-and-forth eye movement elled to and fro between the two plans in the separated condition every 3.75 s on average. To brieÔ¨Çy check if there was an attentional guidance in the sequential group, we considered that when a symbol was Ô¨Åxed within a second after it appeared, it was an attentional capture. With this indicator, we found that the guiding was very common (86% on average) for all participants in the sequential group (66.7% minimum and 100% maximum).  3.2.4.  Total error checking  The eyetracker measurements enabled us to distinguish be- tween those participants who visually checked all the potential sources of errors and those who skipped some of them. In order to compare the numbers of participants who checked all the error zones in each group, we calculated a likelihood ratio chi-square test, which revealed a statistically signiÔ¨Åcant difference between the groups, LR(2, N ¬º 51) ¬º 6.37, p ¬º .041 (see Table 6). To explore this difference in greater depth, we ran a second likelihood ratio test comparing total error-checking frequency between the sepa- rated and integrated groups. This test failed to reveal any signiÔ¨Åcant difference, LR(1, N ¬º 34) ¬º .133, p ¬º .715. A third likelihood ratio test comparing the integrated and sequential groups revealed that total error checking was signiÔ¨Åcantly more frequent in the sequential condition, LR(1, N ¬º 35) ¬º 4.20, p ¬º .040.  3.3. Discussion  Experiment 2 replicated the Ô¨Årst experiment described above, with the addition of eye movement recordings. Results conÔ¨Årmed those of Experiment 1, as once again spatial integration  Table 6 Percentage of participants who checked all the potential sources of error.  Separated Integrated Sequential  All potential sources of error checked  56% 50% 82%  (superimposed plans) improved efÔ¨Åciency and sequential display improved effectiveness. The Ô¨Årst hypothesis tested in Experiment 2 was that coreference is harder to establish when plans are displayed side by side. Results conÔ¨Årmed this hypothesis, as mean total Ô¨Åxation times on error- free zones were longer in the separated condition than in the in- tegrated one. This result showed that, on average, the reduction in task duration in the integrated condition stemmed from a reduc- tion in the amount of time spent on coreferencing rather than in the time spent processing the errors. We can therefore conclude that the negative impact of spatial distance on coreferencing signalled by Johnson and Mayer (2012) can also be observed in the plan comparison situation. One explanation for this is that participants in both studies had to establish coreference between different items of information by looking back and forth. This visual to-ing and fro-ing necessarily resulted in unintentional Ô¨Åxations outside the potential error zones, thus wasting valuable time. We can as- sume that this problem is not inherent to architectural plans, but instead stems from a situation where two visual sources displayed side by side have to be compared area by area. Opting for a side-by- side display in a comparison task of this kind therefore implies that some of the participants‚Äô time will be taken up by the visual ad- justments needed to perform the coreferencing between the subcomponents. Hypothesis 2 was that error zones are Ô¨Åxated for longer when plans are displayed separately rather than being superimposed, as the need to hold comparison information in memory while looking back and forth slows processing down. However, as there was no signiÔ¨Åcant difference in Ô¨Åxation duration between these two con- ditions, this second hypothesis was not validated. The reduced ef- Ô¨Åciency in the separated condition does not, therefore, appear to have stemmed from a slowdown in the comparison process, although as we did not measure participants‚Äô mental load during the task, we cannot totally rule this possibility out. The third hypothesis of Experiment 2 was that effectiveness is greater with a sequential display, as the resulting attentional guidance gives individuals an opportunity to systematically check all the potential errors. This hypothesis was validated by results, as signiÔ¨Åcantly more participants in the sequential group visually checked all the error zones. The static integrated format prevented participants from adopting an organized exploration strategy and thus exposed them to the risk of omitting some of the potential errors. In the sequential condition, the potential errors were dis- played on the screen one by one. Each time, their appearance generated attentional capture (Hillstrom and Chai, 2006; Ludwig et al., 2008) and they were thus more likely to be checked than they would have been in the integrated condition.  4. General discussion  The two experiments described here concerned the display of information on a computer screen by software developed to auto- matically recognize architectural plans. Nevertheless, the conclu- sions reached here are not speciÔ¨Åc to this type of content and apply to other software tools designed to recognize technical documents such as electrical diagrams (Lee, 1992) and even music scores (Bainbridge and Bell, 2001). The retroconversion of these types of documents is not a totally error-free process. For this reason, it is vital for humans to compare the automatic interpretation with the source. How efÔ¨Åcient and effective this comparison is depends mainly on the way in which the information is displayed on the screen. This presentation should promote coreferencing and the exhaustive exploration of the documents. During this human in- spection phase, we therefore recommend superimposing the interpretation and the initial document in order to promote more  
606  S. Fleury, √â.  Jamet / Applied Ergonomics 45 (2014) 601e607  efÔ¨Åcient correction. Furthermore, displaying the interpretation as it unfolds in realtime can improve inspection effectiveness. It should be noted that a sequential display does not impose any particular constraints on users who, for reasons of organization, Ô¨Ånd it more convenient to carry out a posteriori checks. The main result of these two experiments is that it is easier to compare complex visual sources if these sources are superimposed and if one of them appears only gradually on the screen. According to Cierniak et al. (2009), the difÔ¨Åculty of learning from separate but mutually referring sources arises from the need to hold information in memory, which reduces the amount of cognitive resources available. However, the results of Experiment 2 do not allow us to conclude that this is why error processing took longer in the separated condition. This non-result may be related to the small amount of information that had to be retained. In the study con- ducted by Cierniak et al. (2009), the split-source format meant that textual information had to be retained while the picture was explored, whereas for the comparison of the two plans, participants could ‚Äúget away with‚Äù retaining just one item of information at a time, corresponding to one type of feature (door, window or wall). The results reported by these authors may therefore have reÔ¨Çected the sheer volume and complexity of the textual information referring to each area of the picture. Nonetheless, our failure to measure cognitive load during the plan comparison task means that we are unable to reach any Ô¨Årm conclusions on this point. In Experiment 2, participants spent longer Ô¨Åxating on error-free areas in the separated condition than they did in the integrated one, reÔ¨Çecting coreferencing difÔ¨Åculty. This difÔ¨Åculty, characterized by more visual searching, is not restricted to error-Ô¨Ånding tasks, nor indeed to architectural plans, but rather to the processing of separate but mutually referring sources, and we would therefore expect to observe it in experiments exploring the effect of spatial contiguity on the learning of multimedia documents. The studies conducted by Johnson and Mayer (2012) and Holsanova et al. (2008), both of which were supplemented by eyetracking mea- surements, showed that bringing mutually referring items closer together increases the number of direct eye movements between these items. The authors explained these results in terms of easier coreferencing, insofar as participants more readily realize that a given pictorial item of information is linked to a textual item if the two are close together. The results of Experiment 2 suggest that the positive effect of sequential display on error-Ô¨Ånding effectiveness was due to a more exhaustive exploration of the plans, made possible by attentional guidance. We can postulate that in a sequential display, each new element that appears on the screen captures the participants‚Äô attention, thus prompting checking behaviour. A dot moving across a static plan, or salient (e.g., Ô¨Çashing) stimuli to highlight each item in turn would probably have yielded similar results. It should be noted that user interventions during the actual retroconversion process would provide the recognition system with feedback, thus resulting in fewer and fewer errors (Ghorbel et al., 2012). This more cooperative approach to plan correction would mean giving users the ability to halt the retroconversion process, which might in turn obviate the need for them to retain the errors they had identiÔ¨Åed until the end of the recognition process. Future research is needed to investigate this possibility. The results of the two experiments described here have yielded several concrete recommendations for designing the interfaces of CAD, retroconversion and beautiÔ¨Åcation software. The Ô¨Årst clear result was that superimposing the plans reduced the time it took to compare them e a Ô¨Ånding that has practical implications for soft- ware development. To deal with situations where professionals (e.g., architects) manually transfer hand-drawn sketches to com- puters, CAD software could include a function whereby the  digitized document was superimposed on the transferred version. Similarly, in the case of software intended for the retroconversion of technical documents (telephone networks, architectural plans, land registry maps, etc.), the interpreted representation of the document and the digitized document could be superimposed in order to make it easier to spot and correct the system‚Äôs errors. Even the beautiÔ¨Åcation of hand-drawn documents (e.g., design of in- dustrial parts) involves a risk of error and therefore requires the user to check for mistakes. Once again, corrections would be easier to make if the beautiÔ¨Åcation software displayed the end result on top of the hand-drawn sketch. The second result of our two ex- periments was that gradually revealing the interpreted symbols, rather than displaying the entire representation all in one go, made it easier for the human correctors to pinpoint mistakes, by guiding their inspection. Given the increasing numbers of software tools on the market for retroconverting technical documents, it is important to ensure that they include a feature that enables the retro- conversion process to be viewed as it unfolds in realtime, in order to pick up any errors as it goes along. The present study had several limitations. First, the participants were all novices when it came to processing architectural plans. An expert population would doubtless have displayed greater cor- recting efÔ¨Åciency and might spontaneously have adopted more effective exploration strategies. Therefore, it is possible that some expert users do not beneÔ¨Åt from the positive effects of sequen- tiality. However, the sequential presentation happens during a computer processing time that would exist anyway. It can be ignored by the users who would prefer directly verify the inter- pretation completed. Second, in the Ô¨Ånal version of the software, instead of just signalling the errors, users will directly correct them, meaning that they will also have to select the correct feature. As well as possibly increasing task difÔ¨Åculty, this extra stage involving speciÔ¨Åc cognitive processing will raise fresh questions about how the information is best displayed on the screen with more inter- active systems.

s0003687013001701,"  Backpacks are used by children and adults to carry objects over a long distance. Children often carry backpacks that exceed the rec- ommended weight guidelines provided by several Medical and Health Societies (Rodriguez-Oviedo et al., 2012; Talbott et al., 2009; White et al., 2000). Over 92% of children in the United States carry backpacks which are typically loaded with 22% body weight (Negrini et al., 1999; Watson et al., 2002). In addition, adults in professions such as the military, Ô¨ÅreÔ¨Åghting, and mountain rescue routinely carry packs loaded with 60% body weight (Birrell et al., 2007; Rodriguez-Soto et al., 2013). Previous studies of children demonstrate that backpack loads (10e30% body weight) signiÔ¨Åcantly increase contact pressures beneath backpack shoulder straps (Macias et al., 2005, 2008). In fact, this backpack strap contact compression of underlying tissue is higher than the pressure thresholds (approximately 30 mm Hg)  * Corresponding author.

Backpack straps often compress the anterior part of the shoulder, situated in the region over the brachial plexus, axillary artery and vein (Kolodinsky and Brandschwei, 1989; Makela et al., 2006). There- fore, if compression of these tissues occurs it may affect hand/arm circulation and sensation. One study found that a third of back- packers report transient upper extremity paresthesias (Boulware, 2003). In some occupational categories, upper extremity and hand function is required to perform work while donning a heavy backpack. Therefore, reduced sensation and blood perfusion in the hand could impair task function. Heavy backpacks are often used in extreme environments, for example by military during combat, therefore completion of tasks quickly and efÔ¨Åciently is of opera- tional relevance. The purpose of this study was to quantify he- modynamic parameters (brachial artery Ô¨Çow, forearm muscle oxygenation; and microvascular Ô¨Çow, arterial oxygenation) and sensation in upper extremities and hands while wearing a loaded backpack in adults. We hypothesize that backpack loading de- creases brachial artery Ô¨Çow, forearm muscle oxygenation; and microvascular Ô¨Çow, arterial oxygenation and sensation in the Ô¨Ånger.  2.

First, measurements of brachial artery blood Ô¨Çow and microvascular Ô¨Çow at the index Ô¨Ånger conÔ¨Årmed donning a backpack impacts hemodynamics. The second compo- nent of the study sought to determine tissue oxygenation at the volar forearm and index Ô¨Ånger; followed by sensation tests (sub- jective paresthesia, Semmes-Weinstein (SW) monoÔ¨Ålament, and 2-point discrimination tests). Inclusion criteria were normal healthy subjects without history of skeletal or vascular disease. Exclusion criteria were a history of cardiovascular, and/or circu- latory pathologies. SpeciÔ¨Åc exclusion criteria include: atheroscle- rosis, intermittent claudication, acute or chronic deep venous thrombosis, peripheral occlusive arterial disease, diabetes, and hyperparathyroidism. Pregnant women were also excluded as the hemodynamic responses may be different during pregnancy. Moreover, subjects with musculoskeletal injuries or orthopaedic disease in the upper limb, back or spine were not allowed to participate in this study (for example, all subjects with histories of carpal tunnel syndrome, herniated disc, shoulder surgery or injury and severe back pain with inability to stand up with backpack weight were excluded). For the Ô¨Årst part of the study, after written informed consent was obtained, 8 subjects (6 men, 2 women, age range: 18e30 years) underwent the right brachial artery measured with ultra- sound Doppler. Brachial artery Ô¨Çow velocity measurements were assessed using color Ô¨Çow duplex imaging (HDI 5000, Philips Medical Systems, Bothell, WA, USA). A 7.75 MHz linear array probe held at a constant 60 angle of insonation measured brachial ar- tery Ô¨Çow velocity medial to the biceps brachii muscle, midway between the antecubital and axillary regions. Time-averaged ve- locity (mm/s) and brachial artery cross-sectional area (measure in square mm) were calculated using Philips software, and brachial artery blood Ô¨Çow was calculated by multiplying the two. A single investigator performed all duplex measurements as well as anal- ysis of all duplex data. Subjects were instructed to stand with their arms relaxed at their sides and baseline brachial artery Ô¨Çow ve- locity and brachial artery cross-sectional area were measured in the right arm. A conventional backpack (Model TYP7, Jansport, San Leandro, CA) without linking chest strap was loaded with 12 kg of books was then placed on the subject‚Äôs shoulders in the standard 2-strap condition for 10 min. Strap length and position of the backpack was adjusted to comfortable levels for all volunteers. Brachial artery Ô¨Çow velocity and cross-sectional area measure- ments were repeated at the end of this 10-min backpack donning period. On a separate day, index Ô¨Ånger pulp microvascular Ô¨Çow was measured using PPG (Mateus and Hargens, 2012). The device transmits light from a light emitting diode (LED) of two wave- lengths (574 nm and 890 nm), which were then scattered in and absorbed by tissue. A small amount of light that was reÔ¨Çected was received by the probe photodetector. Variations in the detected signal related to blood Ô¨Çow and blood volume of the tissue of interest, such as skeletal muscle (Allen, 2007; Sandberg et al., 2005). Baseline Ô¨Çows were measured immediately before wear- ing loaded backpack after 2e3 min resting period for stabilization. Monitoring of PPG was performed during 10 min of 12 kg back- pack wearing. For each subject, the PPG value obtained at the initial resting period was used as a reference value. All subsequent PPG data were normalized by dividing the reference value and multiplying by 100, thus giving an initial value of 100% for normalized data. In second part of the experiment, 10 other subjects (7 men, 3 women, age range: 20e40 years) were recruited. The Type I error probability associated with this test of this null hypothesis is .05. For sensory measurement at the Ô¨Ånger, patients were unable to observe the monoÔ¨Ålaments touch their hand, the 10 g force Semmes-Weinstein (SW) pressure esthesiometer (Research  Fig. 1. Brachial artery blood Ô¨Çow (mL/s) at baseline (no backpack load) and after 10 min of wearing a 12 kg backpack. Blood Ô¨Çow decreased signiÔ¨Åcantly compared to baseline (p ¬º 0.002).  Designs, Houston, TX) is used to conduct sensory tests on both index and little Ô¨Ångers (Collins et al., 2010; MacDermid et al., 1994). Two Ô¨Ångers were chosen in the hand, because they repre- sent different nerve territories: index for the median nerve and little Ô¨Ånger for the ulnar nerve. The SW monoÔ¨Ålament was pressed perpendicular to the test site with enough pressure to bend the monoÔ¨Ålament for 1 s. Subjects were asked to answer ‚ÄúYes or No‚Äù, when they felt or did not feel the press of the monoÔ¨Ålament, respectively. If a subject did not perceive the Ô¨Ålament at the site diameter, the Ô¨Ålament was increased by one level and retested. The two-point discrimination test was executed in dynamic po- sitions (Dellon et al., 1987). The two-point distance was increased by increments of .5 mm, which are measured with the digitized caliper (MAX-CAL, Japan Micrometer MFG Co., Osaka, Japan), until the subject felt the two compression points. Then resting arterial oxygen saturation was measured with PO (Nellcor N-200, Covidien-Nellcor, Boulder, CO) at the index Ô¨Ånger of the subject and tissue oxygenation was monitored with NIRS device (INVOS Oximeter 5100, Somanetics Corp, Troy, MI) at the volar compart- ment of the forearm (proximal 1/3 of the forearm). NIRS of the volar forearm muscle was measured the balance between oxygen delivery and consumption (Boushel and Piantadosi, 2000; Celie et al., 2012). The NIRS device measured absorption of light trans- mitted from an LED through the muscle at two different wave- lengths (760 and 850 nm). Using the ratio of the AC and DC components of the signals at the two different wavelengths, a change in oxygenation state of hemoglobin that are correlated with tissue oxygen saturation (Breit et al., 1997; Mohler et al., 1997). The measuring site for each test was decided with permuted block randomization technique among 10 subjects. Baseline data were collected after 2e3 min after reaching stable state. Once data were acquired, subjects wore the same 12 kg backpack for 10 min. Data were recorded and the sensory tests were repeated as same protocol and position as baseline. All the experiments were done in same condition at the room tempera- ture (23  C) All statistical analyses were performed using the SPSS software package (version 17.0, SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL). Pre- and post-loading data were compared and analyzed with either paired t test or Wilcoxon sign rank test depending on the characteristic of the variable. Data are presented as means  SD.

The results of this study demonstrate that macro-hemodynamics as well as micro- hemodynamics are signiÔ¨Åcantly affected while wearing a 12 kg backpack for a short 10 min period. The backpack induced alter- ations in hemodynamics were associated with decrements in local tissue oxygenation status. Paresthesia and neurologic disorders with backpack are reported in several studies (Boulware, 2003; Goodson, 1981; Hirasawa and Sakakida, 1983). These disorders are known to be usually self- limited and resolve after removing the backpack. However, these alterations are relatively common among long-distance back- packers (Boulware, 2003). Therefore, for occupations such as Ô¨Åre- Ô¨Åghting and military activities in the Ô¨Åeld that require Ô¨Åne hand function may be adversely affected. Previous studies focus on direct nerve compression by the straps producing paresthesia during backpack carriage (Boulware, 2003; Hirasawa and Sakakida, 1983). Nerve dysfunction is possible by direct nerve compression. How- ever, nerve ischemia may also explain dysfunction of the nerve (Mogyoros et al., 2000). Therefore, it is reasonable to examine he- modynamic changes in upper extremities while wearing a back- pack. Measuring muscle oxygenation is well documented procedure by NIRS in the forearm (Celie et al., 2012; De Blasi et al., 1992). Also Ô¨Ånger PPG test are rapid and non-invasive assessment of peripheral vascular function (Hsiu et al., 2011; Zahedi et al., 2008). Our inter- pretation of altered hemodynamics in upper extremity is direct compression of the artery that decreased brachial artery Ô¨Çow. However, backpacks may compress the axillary vein, causing venous stasis in the arm and subsequent lower brachial artery blood Ô¨Çow  Fig. 3.

Results  All study volunteers completed the entire study protocol, without an adverse event. Donning a backpack (12 kg) for 10 min resulted in a 43% decrease (of baseline) in brachial artery blood Ô¨Çow, 2.66  1.01 mL/s to 1.52  .76 mL/s (p ¬º 0.002). Peak systolic velocity was not affected, but the diastolic component (forward Ô¨Çow) was reduced after wearing the backpack (Fig. 1). Finger microvascular Ô¨Çow decreased from 100% (normalized baseline Ô¨Çow) to 46  17% (p ¬º 0.005), as shown in Fig. 2. Subjective paresthesia at the hand was reported in 7/10 subjects when wearing a backpack for 10-min. However, paresthesia resolved immediately after unloading of the backpack.

Using different design of the backpack may produce slightly different results. Future studies should be directed toward examining hand Ô¨Åne motor skill while wearing a heavy pack. Backpacks may beneÔ¨Åt from a design which maintains normal upper extremity blood Ô¨Çow by preventing compression of the vessels. In conclusion, our aim was to quantify hemodynamic parame- ters and sensation in upper extremities and hands while wearing a loaded backpack (12 kg) in healthy adults for 10 min. All values were compared to baseline before wearing a backpack. We found that moderate-weight backpack loads such as 12 kg decrease upper extremity sensation as well as macrovascular and microvascular hemodynamics after only 10 min. Decreased hemodynamics may result in neurological dysfunction and consequently, probably affect the use of Ô¨Åne motor skills in hand in some occupations.

The strength of our study is that we utilized a comprehensive set of in vivo, non-invasive circulation, oxygenation and sensory mea- sures of the upper extremity. T long term effect of loaded backpacks on the upper extremity blood Ô¨Çow, sensation and function is unknown. Our study had some limitations which we attempted to address. First, the subjects are different between the Ô¨Årst and second part of the study; and there was male preponderance in our study groups. We added the measurements in the second part to test our hypothesis in more detail. Unfortunately it was impossible to recruit same volunteers in the Ô¨Årst and second parts. However, the age range and gender composition for the two components are very similar. Although the total number of recruited subjects was small, our sample size was statistically signiÔ¨Åcant in values in the Ô¨Årst part and second part of the study. Second, load of backpack is not varied and we examined only one load. The weight (12 kg) was chosen because it is 20% load of person with 60 kg. Average backpack load of approximately 20% of the body weight has been documented in previous literature (Negrini et al., 1999, 2004). In this study, two of the subjects weigh less than 60 kg in the second part of the study (47.2 kg, 25.4% of body weight and 41.1 kg, 29.2% of body weight). The pack weight of 12 kg is a relatively light load compared to some military pack weights of 60% body weight (Birrell et al., 2007). We could have applied different load to each subject according to their weight or heavier loads. However, this probably did not change our results. Third, subjects wore the backpack for a 10 min period. A 10 min testing protocol provides a sufÔ¨Åcient amount of time to measure decreased blood Ô¨Çow secondary to a venous tourniquet effect from the backpack straps in a pilot study performed by our lab. How- ever, this likely underestimates the effects of a more realistic sit- uation, where people usually wear heavy packs longer than 10 min. Therefore, extending time course may produce more pronounced decrease in our testing parameters. However, this needs further veriÔ¨Åcation. In addition, we did not study chronic or delayed effects of backpack wear. Lastly, we used conventional type of backpack that does not have a connection strap (sternal strap) between the shoulder straps or waist strap. Our study tested a simple backpack design with two shoulder straps with average width of 5 cm. It is possible that different pack designs may reduce  Acknowledgments  The authors thank Brittany Lim, Clifford Mao, Ibrahim Yusufu, Michael D Ramirez, Roshmi Bhattacharya, Susan Aminzai for participating and supporting in the study.

s0003687013001713,"  Warning effectiveness is critical in warning pictorial design, as it relates to the safety value of the message. Rogers et al. (2000) expanded the factors contributing to warning pictorial efÔ¨Åcacy to include not only the characteristics of the warning itself, but also the context and recipients of the warning. Despite a focus on per- sonal characteristics, the affective state of the recipient has so far been overlooked as a potential inÔ¨Çuence on comprehension and hazard perception of warning pictorial. In psychology, the term ‚Äòaffect‚Äô refers to emotion or subjectively experienced feelings, such as happiness or fear. In this study, affect encompasses emotions, mood, and feelings. It is conceivable that people who are experiencing positive affect may show improved comprehension of warning pictorials as a factor of improved productivity. For instance, Isen and colleagues reported that when people felt good, their thinking became more creative, integrative, and Ô¨Çexible, and they became more receptive (Isen, 1987). Positive affect can inÔ¨Çuence people to think, feel, and act in a productive way (Lyubomirsky et al., 2005). Conversely, Schwarz et al. (1991) has shown that negative emotions tend to encourage people to be more careful when  * Corresponding author.

Negative emotions have an intuitively obvious adaptive value to cognitive processes, in that they narrow our thought-action repertories to those that best promoted the survival of our ancestors in life-threatening situations (Fredrickson, 2003). In the case of warning signs, which are intended to communicate information about safety issues or risks, negative affect might promote cognitive processes that facilitate hazard perception. Several studies have conÔ¨Årmed that affective state plays an important role in risk perception (Solvic and Peters, 2006). While positive affect is associated with a greater inclination for risk- taking, when the potential for loss is salient, individuals who are feeling good tend to have a greater concern about such loss (Isen, 1987). On the other hand, several studies have argued that nega- tive emotion plays a powerful role in risk perception. For example, Clore and Palmer (2009) found that negative mood, such as fear, tends to focus one‚Äôs attention towards relevant perceptual details. The effect of affective states on the comprehension and hazard perception of warning pictorials is unclear. If the perception and processing of warning pictorials varies according to affective state, the design and tests of such signs should reÔ¨Çect this information. Thus, the purpose of the present study was to examine the effects of positive and negative affective states on the comprehension and hazard perception of warning pictorials. It can be assumed that focused attention and cognitive processing are more important than productivity for the perception of hazards and comprehension of warning pictorials. Thus we hypothesized that negative affect  0003-6870/$ e see front matter √ì 2013 Elsevier Ltd and The Ergonomics Society.

s0003687013001786,"  Rapid advances in information technology have resulted in new methods of data entry (e.g., cell phone keyboards and touch screens) and new forms of language (e.g., short message service). Users increasingly want to use text intensive software on mobile devices (Sandnes and Aubert, 2007); however, smaller devices inevitably employ smaller displays (ZieÔ¨Çe, 2010; Hashimoto et al., 2003) and keyboards (Colle and Hiszem, 2004), which reduce us- ability. When users obtain information from portable devices, they prefer the largest possible display area and the smallest keyboard that provides good usability and typing speed (Yoshitake, 1995; Pereira et al., 2013). Ha et al. (2004) indicated that existing entry methods on mobile communication devices suffer from poor typing efÔ¨Åciency and impose a cognitive processing burden on users. To meet the challenges posed by miniaturization of these devices, many designers have developed variants of conventional QWERTY keyboards, including changes to the layout or integration of mul- tiple keys on a standard-sized keyboard (Sheng, 1985). However, more research on the usability of miniature keyboards is needed. Ease of use has become a critical design factor for input devices (Beddoes and Hu, 1994; Lee and Zhai, 2004). More speciÔ¨Åcally, users prefer and expect high input speed and ease of learning for new technologies, and show a marked aversion to products that are perceived as overly cognitively demanding (Sanders and  * Corresponding author. Tel.: √æ886 6 2757575x54333; fax: √æ886 6 2746088. E-mail address: hedyhanchi@yahoo.com.tw (H.-C. Hsiao).  McCormick, 1993; Sandnes and Aubert, 2007). Because one key per character is considered the minimal design speciÔ¨Åcation for the 36 characters (26 letters and numerals 0e9) that are needed for English entry, the state-of-the-art in miniature keyboards shrinks the keys to Ô¨Åt them into a limited space. However, there are two limitations for these miniature keyboards. First, they demonstrate a greater reliance on thumbs, which might result in physical discomfort (Baker et al., 2007; Olszewska et al., 2009) and often lead to a reduction in input efÔ¨Åciency (Colle and Hiszem, 2004; Harada et al., 1996). Another limitation is that most people are comfortable with the QWERTY design and Ô¨Ånd it very difÔ¨Åcult to accept other layouts (Beeching, 1974; Gopher and Raij, 1988). Consequently, some researchers have proposed maintaining a QWERTY-based system as these devices reduce the time typists use for searching (Sandnes and Aubert, 2007; Bi et al., 2010). However, to the best of our knowledge, no system has been developed with a combination of QWERTY layout and miniature keyboards. Investi- gating miniature keyboards with a QWERTY layout yields useful insights into the input devices required to improve entry methods. limit of short-term memory is 7  2 items Because humans‚Äô (Miller, 1956), combining an appropriate number of characters (e.g., less than seven) on a single keycap strengthens the relationship among these characters. That is, the relationship of characters on the same keycap provides additional hints for users to help them memorize the positions of characters (Sanders and McCormick, 1993) and, thus, to improve input efÔ¨Åciency (B√ºrdek, 2005). Therefore, we proposed four multi-character keyboards that do not follow the conventional one-to-one alphanumeric-symbol-to- key ratio for small devices. Although the proposed keyboards have  0003-6870/$ e see front matter √ì 2013 Elsevier Ltd and The Ergonomics Society. All rights reserved. http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2013.09.001

Accordingly, the present study evaluated four miniature keyboards on input efÔ¨Åciency, accuracy, comfort, likability and learnability for users.  2. Method  2.1.  Participants  Thirty-two participants were recruited in this study. No partic- ipant reported musculoskeletal problems with his/her hands. All participants had normal visual acuity or corrected to normal with glasses or contact lenses. All participants were right-handed with a mean computer experience of 10.4  3.8 years. Their ages ranged from 18.0 to 52.0 years, with a mean age of 24.2  5.8 years. All participants read and signed the consent form. The participants were categorized as fast or slow typists based on their typing ability, which was evaluated by the English Typing Credential System with 30 words per minute (wpm) as the benchmark for basic typing ability. The participants were asked to use ten-Ô¨Ånger typing on a conventional QWERTY keyboard (Acer KU-0355) (Fig. 1). The Typing Credential System software (Chinese Computer Education Association of Taiwan) was used to test En- glish typing ability. This study used the articles provided by the system as typing materials for each participant. The typing speed of the participants was measured using the conventional QWERTY keyboard. Typing speed ¬º (total hit number e number of errors * 50)/(5 * period). Each participant was tested twice with the same given article (10 min for each test); the higher score was recorded and deÔ¨Åned as his/her typing ability. The fast group (6M and 10F) typed 38.7  4.5 wpm, whereas the slow group (7M and 9F) typed 23.4  7.3 wpm when tested with a QWERTY keyboard. The typing ability of the participants ranged from 13.28 to 51.34 wpm, with a mean of 29.05  9.46 wpm.  2.2.  Proposed keyboards  Four keyboards were designed in the current study. All of the keyboards contained keycaps, either square or rectangular; a pre- vious study showed that square targets are reached more efÔ¨Åciently than are round ones (Whisenand and Emurian, 1999). Moreover, a 19-mm horizontal centre spacing of keycaps, which is the same as the Acer KU-0355 keyboard, was used to avoid the inÔ¨Çuences from centre spacing. In addition, using the proposed keyboard with the ten-Ô¨Ånger typing method, the index Ô¨Ånger of one hand can handle two keycaps and the middle, ring and little Ô¨Ångers of the hand can handle one keycap, respectively. There are four characters in a keycap. Thus, the left little Ô¨Ånger can enter 1QAZ, the left ring Ô¨Ånger enters 2WSX, the left middle Ô¨Ånger enters 3EDC, the left index Ô¨Ånger enters 4RFV5TGB, the right index Ô¨Ånger enters 6YHN7UJM, the right middle Ô¨Ånger enters 8IK and comma, the right ring Ô¨Ånger enters 9OL and the period mark, and the right little Ô¨Ånger enters the 0P, semi-colon and slash marks. The internal structure of each keycap, which controls four characters, was determined. Because there is no available switch for controlling four characters simultaneously, electrical tactile switches were used to control each character. The four switches within each keycap were closely arranged to shorten the Ô¨Ånger movement distance, and to enhance input speed. There were two types of tactile switches with different connection sizes used in the current study: a 2-pin switch and a 4-pin switch (Fig. 2). The 4-pin switch contained a smaller-sized connection and was used on the smaller keycaps. The number of pins represents the number of signal lines soldered on the circuit board. Users pressed the keycap in one of four locations to indirectly trigger the tactile switches and  Fig. 1.

Moreover, a layer of foam was adhered to the outside of switch and marked with corresponding characters. The arrangement and the keycap structure of four proposed keyboards: described below (Fig. 3). The area taken by all of the keycaps and the space between (excluding the space bar) was 4887 mm2 in the  linear, separated linear, edge and corner keyboards are  linear and separated linear keyboards, whereas the edge and corner  keyboards covered 2196 mm2 and 3196 mm2, respectively. The area of the full-sized (conventional) keyboard, the Acer KU-0355, was 14697 mm2. The area of the linear and separated linear keyboards took up 33% of the area of the Acer KU-0355 QWERTY keyboard. The area of the edge keyboard took up 14.67% of the area of the Acer KU-0355 QWERTY keyboard, whereas the area of the corner keyboard took up 21.75% of the area of the Acer KU-0355 QWERTY keyboard. The area of the four proposed keyboards was signiÔ¨Å- cantly smaller than that of the conventional QWERTY keyboard.  (1) Linear keyboard (type B1): four characters were arranged in a straight line on each rectangular keycap (Fig. 3) with an in- ternal structure of 2-pin switches (Fig. 4). The users could sense the raised edges on the keycaps to distinguish corre- sponding characters by moving slightly forward or backward. (2) The Separated linear keyboard (type B2) was very similar to the linear keyboard, retaining the rectangular shape (Fig. 3). However, the numeral keycaps with 4-pin switches were raised compared with linear keyboard, so that they could be pressed with a very light touch. The other keycaps used 2-pin switches (Fig. 4). (3) The Edge keyboard (type B3) was a modiÔ¨Åcation of the con- ventional QWERTY keyboard. There were four characters on each square key, arranged counter-clockwise on each keycap with the numeral in the upper-right corner (Fig. 3). Pressing one side of a keycap could input the corresponding character. Note the internal structure was based on 2-pin switches (Fig. 4).

Experimental tasks,  instruments and materials  A personal computer (Acer Power F6) with Windows XP Pro and a monitor (ViewSonic VE175) were used to present experimental tasks. The size of the screen (including bezel) was 414.89 mm (width)  229 mm (length) and the typing material was displayed with a resolution of 1024 (horizontal)  768 (vertical) pixels. The chairs were Ô¨Åxed to the Ô¨Çoor and the back of the chairs was adjusted to 115 . The seat height was adjusted to allow the par- ticipants to place their feet Ô¨Çat on the ground, forming a 90 or less angle between their lower legs and the ground. The sitting depth and the backs of the chairs were adjusted to make the participants feel comfortable. The angle between the screen and the horizontal view of the eyes was 15 and the distance between the centre of the screen and eyes was 60 cm. After setting up the experimental equipment, participants could slightly adjust their chairs for com- fort. Once the experiment had started, the chairs could not be further adjusted. All participants used both hands to perform all tasks that required using 10 Ô¨Ångers. The room temperature was maintained at 26  C.  2.3.1.  Character keystroke test  The character keystroke system was written with LabView software to determine the actual degree to which the participants were familiar with the single keycap on the conventional keyboard, and to prevent the language ability of the participants from affecting the actual typing speed. The characters in the testing system included 26 letters, 10 numerals (0e9), and 4 symbols (semi-colon, slash mark, period and comma), totalling 40 charac- ters. An examination question asked the user to input one  character. When a participant pressed the space bar after entering the character according to the examination question, the next question appeared. Note, the system did not allow errors to be corrected. Moreover, there were two modes in this system: practice mode and test mode. In the practice mode, each character appeared randomly three times, for a total of 120 characters. In the test mode, each character appeared only once, for a total of 40 characters. Each participant had to complete entry of the 120 characters in the practice mode and the 40 characters in the test mode.  2.4.  Experimental procedure  Each participant visited our laboratory for two contiguous days. We conducted the typing ability test on the Ô¨Årst day to determine the participants‚Äô group. On the second day, the participants un- derwent character keystroke tests on the 4 proposed keyboards. The testing sequence for the 4 proposed keyboards was random- ized for each participant to minimize order-related and con- founding effects from learning. There were 3 steps for each character keystroke test: (1) Becoming familiar with the keyboard using the practice mode of the character keystroke system (it usually takes approximately 5 min for participants to become familiar with a keyboard); (2) Conducting the keystroke test using the test mode of the character keystroke system; and (3) Filling out the subjective questionnaire for self-evaluation. After completing the 3 steps of each keyboard, the participants had a 3-min break. For each keyboard, the participants went through the steps and then moved on to the next keyboard. After the 3 steps had been completed for the 4 proposed keyboards, the participants were interviewed to select the favourite keyboard among the 4 key- boards and to ascertain the reasons.  2.5.

Participants marked X on a 100-mm linear scale to express their degree of agreement (Wu et al., 2003). The longer the measured length, the more user agreement was assigned to the statement.  2.5.2.  Subjective rating  The outcome measurement of the proposed keyboards included a subjective questionnaire that was examined by a visual analogue scale. The statements of the questionnaire included: (1) I like the keyboard; (2) My hands are very comfortable when I use the keyboard; and (3) For me, it is easy to learn the keyboard. These  All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS 13.0 (SPSS for Windows, Chicago, IL, USA). The dependent variables were: typing speed, accuracy, likability, comfort and learnability. A two-way repeated ANOVA was performed with one between-subject factor (fast and slow typists) and one within-subject factor  (linear,  2.6.  Statistical analysis

If the assumption of sphericity was violated, the degrees of freedom were corrected by the Huynh-Feldt correction. In addition, given the number of analyses conducted, the alpha level for signiÔ¨Åcant main effects and interactions was set at p < 0.05. When a signiÔ¨Åcant interaction between a typing group and a keyboard was observed, Bonferroni post hoc tests were con- ducted and the p values from the post hoc were multiplied by the number of comparisons, and then compared with 0.05 as the sig- niÔ¨Åcance level for adjustment.  3. Results  The results of typing speed, accuracy, likability, comfort and learnability of the slower and faster typists when typing on the 4 proposed keyboards are described below.  3.1.  Typing speed and accuracy  The interaction effect (p ¬º 0.11) and main effect of typing ability (p ¬º 0.17) did not reach a signiÔ¨Åcant level on typing speed, but the main effects of keyboard were signiÔ¨Åcant (p < 0.001). Post hoc tests showed that the typing speed was signiÔ¨Åcantly faster on B2 compared to the others (p ¬º 0.004e0.030) (Fig. 5 left). (p ¬º 0.52) and typing ability No signiÔ¨Åcant interaction effect main effect (p ¬º 0.41) were found in the accuracy data; however, a signiÔ¨Åcant effect of keyboard was observed (p ¬º 0.049). The effects of different levels of B factor on accuracy were compared by the Bonferroni post hoc analysis; the four keyboard types did not differ from each other (p ¬º 0.070e1.000) (Fig. 5 right). Participants used the QWERTY keyboard in the character keystroke test. Their average typing speed on the QWERTY keyboard was 49.4 words per minute, and their average accuracy was 97%. Comparing the average typing speed on the QWERTY keyboard with that on each miniature keyboard, it can be observed from the dotted lines on the left side of Fig. 5 that the average typing speed on each miniature keyboard is far slower than on a standard keyboard. Moreover, the average accuracy using the QWERTY keyboard is compared with that using each miniature  Fig. 5. Typing speed and accuracy of four keyboards (*: signiÔ¨Åcant difference, p < 0.05). The upper dotted lines indicate the average typing speed on the QWERTY keyboard (left) and average accuracy (right).  keyboard. From the dotted lines on the right side of Fig. 5 it can be found that there is no difference in average accuracy between using each miniature keyboard and a standard keyboard.  3.2.  Likability, comfort and learnability  (p ¬º 0.51) and main effect of No signiÔ¨Åcant interaction effect typing ability (p ¬º 0.46) were found in scores of likability, but the main effect of keyboard (p ¬º 0.002) was signiÔ¨Åcant. After post hoc paired comparisons, there were greater scores of likability on the B2 keyboard than on the B3 keyboard (p ¬º 0.005) (Fig. 6). On the other hand, no signiÔ¨Åcant interaction effect (p ¬º 0.42) or main ef- fect (typing ability: p ¬º 0.22; keyboard: p ¬º 0.15) was found in the scores of comfort. Because the interaction effect reached signiÔ¨Åcance in the scores learnability (p ¬º 0.018), the simple effect tests were conducted of further. With respect to the simple main effect of typing ability in each keyboard, a signiÔ¨Åcant difference was observed in regard to the B1 keyboard (p ¬º 0.030) (Fig. 7 top). On the other hand, when the simple effect tests of 4 different keyboards were conducted within the slow and fast typists, both of them were signiÔ¨Åcant (fast typists: p ¬º 0.046; slow typists: p ¬º 0.002).

According to a previous study (Curran et al., 2006), if the device is designed for recreation or communication, then emphasis is placed on fast input speed. However, when information entry is a critical function of the de- vice, the accuracy factor becomes essential. Therefore, we sug- gested the B2 keyboard be considered for use in devices designed for informal communication, whereas the keyboards with square keycaps might be applied for formal message entry.  4.1.1.  Typing speed  The keyboard type was found to affect the typing speed, which is consistent with the previous Ô¨Ånding of Rempel et al. (2007), who studied the effects of the locations of single-element keycaps. In contrast, the current study placed the emphasis on improving the operation of the keyboard while increasing the space available on small devices for other features, and it demonstrated different operating methods. The participants in our study moved their Ô¨Ångers backward and forward when using the B1 and B2 key- boards, whereas they typed on the B3 and B4 keyboards by moving Ô¨Ångers to the side. The operation method may have affected the typing speed, and we surmised that the method of moving Ô¨Ångers backward and forward might attain faster speeds than the side-to- side method. There were two potential reasons for the greater input speed on the B2 keyboard. First, this may result from the perpen- dicular line of Ô¨Ånger motion with the longer key arrangement being more natural. Second, the design of the B2 keyboard (separating keycaps of numerals and letters) made it easier for the users to Ô¨Ånd the required characters. The 3-mm gap between the numeral keycap and the letter keycap was large enough for humans to sense it because the threshold of two-point discrimination on a Ô¨Ångertip is 3 mm for young adults (Bowden and McNulty, 2012). Note that the majority of participants thought that the B2 keyboard was suitable for use in small devices, such as PDAs, due to faster typing speed. It is difÔ¨Åcult to evaluate the data input efÔ¨Åciency of new equipment because beginners (e.g., the slow typists in the current study) need a substantial amount of time for familiarization. Moreover, the miniaturized design of mobile devices makes it difÔ¨Åcult to produce keycaps which contain the feeling of full-sized versions (i.e., conventional QWERTY keyboards). Although the present study provided less than 30 min of practice time, the typing speed of the miniature keyboards was very close to half of the speed on conventional keyboards (49.41 characters/min, additional test). Previous researchers (c.f., van Galen et al., 2007) have evalu- ated the effect of a vertical keyboard design on typing efÔ¨Åciency, and the participants were allowed 8 practice runs in two 30- min sessions. Their input speed approached the one attained with the conventional QWERTY keyboard, although it did not sur- pass the efÔ¨Åciency of a conventional QWERTY keyboard. Thus, they surmised that the vertical keyboard may provide greater ease of learning for slow typists, who require at least one hour of practice to achieve competence.  4.1.2. Accuracy  Although there was no signiÔ¨Åcant difference among the four proposed keyboards, the accuracy for the square keycaps (B3 and B4) was greater than that for the rectangular keycaps (B1 and B2). The arrangement of the square keycaps was relatively unfamiliar for the participants; the users required more time to consider the locations of the elements on the keycaps, with the possible side effect of making them more careful. In addition, it should be noted that there were no distinguish- able symbols on the surface of the keycaps of the B1 keyboard, so the participants were unable to differentiate the two middle characters; this may have caused the B1 keyboard to receive an  Fig. 6.

For the fast typists, the greater scores of learnability were observed in regard to the B1 keyboard than the B3 keyboard (p ¬º 0.013) (Fig. 7 bottom). For the slow typists, the greater scores of learnability were observed in regard to the B2 keyboard compared with the B1 keyboard (p ¬º 0.016) (Fig. 7 bottom).  4. Discussion  4.1. Objective rating  We found the fastest input speed on the B2 keyboard, and greater accuracy was observed in keyboards with square keycaps  Fig. 7.

H.-C. Hsiao et al.  / Applied Ergonomics 45 (2014) 655e662  661  accuracy score lower than that of the B2 keyboard. A previous study reported that a physical keyboard is better than a touch screen for older people (Wright et al., 2000), so that it is essential for typists to have sufÔ¨Åcient sensory input when they are typing. Additionally, in the interviews after the typing tests, most participants stated that they experienced frustration in trying to sense the two adjacent characters. Participants in the current study commented that when using the B4 keyboard, they could use the relations between letters and shapes of keycaps to help them distinguish locations of the desired characters. The higher accuracy of square keycaps compared to rectangular ones in the present study supported the concept proposed by Fischer (B√ºrdek, 2005) that using surfaces with either convex or concave borders increases the ability of products to suggest their functions. More speciÔ¨Åcally, when using the corner keyboard to input the characters E and R, participants relied on the feeling of the sharp-edged shape on the top corner of keycaps to recognize the different locations of the characters, without needing to rely on visual assistance. Moreover, when inputting a sequence of charac- ters on the same keycap (such as C and D), the units located on different parts of the keycaps helped typists to gain a sense of di- rection for typing. This sense of direction indicates that participants were using the relationship between the layout of the QWERTY keyboard and the character arrangements on the proposed key- boards to remember the locations of each character. Thus, the desired characters were easily found based on memory. Accord- ingly, the arrangement of the characters on the proposed keyboards and the cue implied by the shape of square keycaps enhanced the typing accuracy.  4.2.  Subjective rating  4.2.1.  Likability  With respect to likability, the lower scores in the B3 keyboard compared to the B2 keyboard may have resulted from the locations of characters on the keycaps. The participants stated that the B3 keyboards were not easy to remember. The arrangement of char- acters on the B3 keyboard required users to think a lot, unlike those of the B4 type, which had a very clear up, down, left and right arrangement of the characters. It was evident that the oblique pattern was less accurately distinguished by human Ô¨Ångers than were the vertical and horizontal patterns (Kops and Gardner, 1996). Therefore, the smaller scores of likability in regard to the B3 keyboard are explained because the participants had to move their Ô¨Ångers in an oblique direction to reach the locations of the desired characters.  4.2.2.  Learnability  The level of personal typing ability led to inconsistent evalua- tions given by typists concerning the learnability of the four pro- posed keyboards. Clearly, the users had different preferences for the keyboards with regard to learnability. The learnability of the B1 keyboard was higher for the fast typists, who prefer the conven- tional conÔ¨Åguration (the B1 keyboard is very similar to the QWERTY keyboard). However, the learnability of the B2 keyboard is afÔ¨Årmed preferentially by the slow typists. From the learnability scores, it can be surmised that typing ability is an important factor to take into consideration when designing keyboards. Because the slow typists have higher learnability scores for the B2 keyboard, the B2 keyboard might be the most suitable keyboard for beginners, while the B1 keyboard might be an appropriate keyboard for fast typists. There was a limitation that should be acknowledged. The par- ticipants did not do realistic typing tests on the four proposed keyboards in this study. It is possible that realistic typing tests on  proposed keyboards may yield different Ô¨Åndings. Thus, a more thorough analysis of keyboard functionality is required in a future study.  5.  Conclusion  linear  separated  Four miniature keyboards were proposed and tested by slow and fast typists. We evaluated the input speed, accuracy, comfort, likability and learnability on four miniature keyboards. The results showed that the keyboard contained the best proÔ¨Åciency speed, highest comfort and greatest user acceptance among the four keyboards. Moreover, the keyboards with square- shaped keycaps had better input accuracy than that with rectangular-shaped ones. The corner keyboard had better scores of likability than the keyboard because people are more comfortable with moving their Ô¨Ångers in vertical and horizontal patterns rather than in oblique patterns. Finally, the proposed keyboards were smaller than current keyboards, reducing the need for visual conÔ¨Årmation of a keycaps‚Äô location and the correct Ô¨Ånger motions.  edge  Acknowledgements  The authors would like to thank Yu-Hsian Huang and En-Hung Wu from the Electrical Engineering Department of National Cheng Kung University for their assistance in the maintenance of the experimental keyboards used in the study.

s0003687013001798,"  Integrating ergonomics into engineering design of new work- places and production systems is believed to be an important pro- active strategy to enhance good working conditions and production efÔ¨Åciency (Broberg, 2010; Dul and Neumann, 2009; Jensen, 2002; Hendrick, 2008, Neumann et al., 2006, 2009). A widespread approach to integrate ergonomic knowledge in engineering design is to provide the designers with information on ergonomics, through for instance ergonomic standards or handbooks. Studies have however indicated that this approach alone does not ensure successful integration (Broberg, 2007; Burns and Vicente, 1994; Campbell, 1996; Helander, 1999; Rogers and Armstrong, 1977). Wulff et al. (1999a,b) have studied the integration of ergonomics in large-scale engineering design in the offshore industry in Norway. Here, documents containing ergonomic requirements were distributed within the design organization under the assumption that designers would integrate the requirements in their work- space design. Wulff et al. (1999a,b) found, however, that the re- quirements were not well known in the design organization, and even when the designers did know the requirements, they were not all integrated into the Ô¨Ånal design. Some requirements were difÔ¨Å- cult for the designers to interpret, while others created a situation of conÔ¨Çicting criteria. These Ô¨Åndings illustrate possible limitations  * Corresponding author.

E-mail addresses:  to using objects like documents to pass on ergonomic knowledge in design processes. However, so far, the human factors (HF) has not given much attention to a broader focus on how different objects can help or limit integration of ergonomic knowledge in design processes.  1.1.  Theoretical perspectives on objects  Traditionally, engineering designers have viewed objects, such as drawings and prototypes, as neutral: Objects are means of coming from an idea to a result (Vinck et al., 1996). A different view of objects is found within the Science and Technology Studies (STS) tradition. STS has focused on the role of different objects for several years. Objects here are regarded as mediators that can play an active role in design processes (Vinck et al., 1996), and as a result, different theoretical concepts have been developed. The concepts  of boundary objects and intermediary objects, which are presented  below, have been used successfully to create new insights and a greater understanding of the role of objects in design processes (Boujut and Blanco, 2003; Carlile, 2002).  I) The concept of boundary objects was introduced in Star and Griesemer‚Äôs (1989) studies of scientiÔ¨Åc work. Star and Griesemer (1989) focused on the heterogeneous nature of scientiÔ¨Åc work and introduced the concept of boundary ob- jects as a way to manage the tension at the boundary be- tween diverse groups of actors. According to Star and Griesemer (1989), different groups of actors belong to different social worlds, and when they work together,  0003-6870/$ e see front matter √ì 2013 Elsevier Ltd and The Ergonomics Society.

Broberg / Applied Ergonomics 45 (2014) 647e654  boundary objects can help establish a shared context be- tween them that helps create common understanding of the subject in question. The nature of the boundary objects ‚Äúis  reÔ¨Çected by the fact that they are simultaneously concrete and abstract, speciÔ¨Åc and general, conventionalized and custom-  ized‚Äù (Star and Griesemer, 1989). Carlile (2002) drew on the work of Star and Griesemer and introduced the concept of boundary objects to the area of new product development. He found that objects such as assembly drawings can be useful when cooperating across different knowledge do- mains in a design process. He identiÔ¨Åed three characteristics  it  jects  II)  sec-  ondly,  of a useful boundary object: It ‚Äúestablishes a shared syntax or language for individuals to represent their knowledge‚Äù; it ‚Äúprovides a concrete means for individuals to specify and learn about their differences and dependencies across a given boundary‚Äù; and Ô¨Ånally, ‚Äúfacilitates a process where individuals can jointly transform their knowledge‚Äù  (Carlile, 2002, pp. 451e452). In this paper, we deÔ¨Åne boundary ob- as objects that function as mediators in the direct communication between actors. In contrast to the concept of boundary objects, we introduce the concept of intermediary objects. These objects are used as a means of transferring and sustaining knowledge, for instance, in a design process, when actors may not be able to meet in person. The concept was developed by Callon (1992), who presented four different types of intermediaries: texts, technical artifacts, human beings and their skills, and money. In this paper, we focus on texts. An intermediary object is an object produced by a network of designers with the speciÔ¨Åc intent of transferring their knowledge and experience to downstream actors. In relation to workplace design, the aim of the designers is to affect the Ô¨Ånal design of the workplace from a distance. An intermediary object, however, creates a new point of departure, and downstream actors might not comply with the intentions embedded in the object: After receiving an intermediary object, downstream actors do not necessarily just transfer the content of the object. When relating the object to their own profession or work practice, downstream actors may ignore or alter different parts of the intermediary object and thus transform the content of the intermediary object according to their own interest, purpose or profession (Gherardi and Nicolini, 2000; Vinck et al., 1996).  Ô¨Çexible  and malleable objects,  integrating ergonomics. In the area of participatory ergonomics, Broberg et al. (2011) Ô¨Ånd that the characteristics of boundary ob- jects are of great importance in enabling user participation and collaboration in design. One of the important characteristics is as this characteristic creates the possibility to do rapid prototyping of design solutions. In another study, Concei√ß√£o et al. (2012) develop two intermediary objects, a recommendation booklet and a zoning pattern, in order to transfer ergonomic knowledge and user experience to designers working in the offshore industry. In this industry, face-to-face meetings be- tween users and designers are not always possible, which makes information transfer via objects unavoidable. At workshops with engineering designers, the usability of the two intermediary ob- jects was evaluated as positive, and they were recommended for use in future design processes. Both studies were based on objects designed by researchers. Objects developed in a ‚Äònatural‚Äô design process, without the participation of researchers, have not been given much attention in the HF literature so far.  1.3. Aim of  the study and use of  the concepts  The aim of this study is to provide greater understanding of the role of objects used in ‚Äònatural‚Äô design processes where ergonomic knowledge is integrated into engineering design processes. We seek to gain this understanding by applying the concepts of  boundary objects and intermediary objects in an analysis of an en-  gineering design case in which an ergonomist participated in the design process. Both theoretical concepts provide the possibility to enhance our understanding of the different roles an object might play during the integration of ergonomic knowledge into engi- neering design processes. The paper is concluded by providing implications for both er- gonomists and engineering designers.  2. Method  An explorative case study (Thomas, 2011) was carried out in an engineering consultancy Ô¨Årm for the purpose of increasing un- derstanding of the role objects play in the process of integrating ergonomic knowledge in design. We begin by describing the case scenario.  2.1.  The setting  Vinck et al. (1996) address the view and characteristics of intermediary objects by distinguishing between ‚Äúopen‚Äù and ‚Äúclosed‚Äù objects. The characteristics of a ‚Äúclosed‚Äù object refer to the designers‚Äô intention: The users are not supposed to interpret or transform the intentions embedded in the object, rather to comply with them. The characteristics of an ‚Äúopen‚Äù object are, on the other hand, related to the interpretive Ô¨Çexibility of a given object, which is bound to the use of the object. When an object is interpreted and modiÔ¨Åed by the various users of the object, it is considered to be ‚Äúopen‚Äù (Broberg et al., 2011; Vinck et al., 1996). In an ergonomic context an example of an intermediary object is an ergonomic standard, which from the outset is produced as a ‚Äúclosed‚Äù object intended to transfer knowledge from ergonomists to other design actors. Whether or not the standard succeeds will depend, how- ever, on the users interpretation of the standard as either a ‚Äúclosed‚Äù or an ‚Äúopen‚Äù object.  1.2. Objects in HF literature  A few studies in the HF literature draw on the STS tradition and indicate that different kinds of objects can play an important role in  An engineering consultancy Ô¨Årm was hired by a hospital to design a sterile processing plant. The design task involved designing the logistics and layout to deliver as a project proposal for the hospital and their building contractor. The design team included engineers with different areas of expertise; a consultant (C1) who was a trained nurse; a project manager (PM) who was an engineer and the head of the hospital division. The physical space designated for the sterile processing plant was rather cramped; therefore, the project team decided to involve one of the engineering consultancy Ô¨Årm‚Äôs own ergonomists in the project. The coordinator of the ergonomists‚Äô ‚Äúhospital group‚Äù was in charge of selecting the ergonomist to assign to the design job. Based on his experience from other design jobs, he selected a trained physiotherapist. The ergonomist‚Äôs job was to make sure that the design proposal complied with existing occupational health and safety (OHS) legislation, and to complete an ergonomic guideline document (EGD) with her recommendations for the design. After the design proposal had been completed and submitted, the hospital contacted the engineering consultancy Ô¨Årm again for assistance during both the construction and start-up phases at the

Table 1 illustrates the phases of the design process and the central design actors involved.  2.2. Data collection  The data material was collected over a Ô¨Åve-month through interviews, observation and document study.  period  2.2.1.  Interviews  Twelve semi-structured interviews (Kvale, 1996) were carried out. Purposive sampling (Miles and Huberman, 1994) was used to select whom to interview. We were interested in actors who had been engaged in integrating ergonomic knowledge into the engi- neering design job. Within the engineering consultancy Ô¨Årm, the interviews included the head of the hospital division, the project manager, two consultants, an ergonomic group leader and two ergonomists. Within the hospital organization, the interviews included the manager of the sterile processing plant, a health and safety representative and two ergonomists. All interviews were audio recorded and afterward transcribed.  2.2.2. Observation  The Ô¨Årst author visited the completed sterile processing plant to observe the design in operation. She observed the users and interviewed four of them while they were working, and identiÔ¨Åed whether or not the ergonomic recommendations from the EGD had been realized in the Ô¨Ånal design.  2.2.3. Documents  A study was made of the documents related to the project. The objective was to gain an overview of the design process and un- derstand the degree to which ergonomic issues were discussed at project meetings. The document study involved examining minutes of meetings, project presentations, project plans, drawings, work- ing documents and Ô¨Ånally the EGD. Based on these documents, we were able to create a Ô¨Çow chart displaying the progress of the design process.  2.3. Data analysis  objects  boundary  material and the theoretical concepts of and intermediary objects. This iterative process continued throughout the writing process, where the theoretical concept helped us to make sense of the empirical Ô¨Åndings, and the data material helped us to make sure our claims and Ô¨Åndings were grounded within the data. The theoretical concepts helped us to gain new insights about how the objects had helped or limited the integration of ergonomic knowledge in the design process.  3. Results  Through thorough analysis of transcriptions and the project documents, it appeared that two objects had played a central role during integration of ergonomic knowledge into the design pro- cess: The EGD and layout sketches of the sterile processing plant. The Ô¨Årst document we address is the layout sketches.  3.1.  The layout sketches  The layout sketches were used at meetings between the ergono- mist, C1, and the project manager in their discussions of the future design of the sterile processing plant. The discussions can be char- acterized as dialogs, where C1 and the project manager presented the ergonomist with their layout suggestions. The ergonomist then commented on the layout sketches and suggested changes, and in this way contributed her knowledge of ergonomics. As described by C1:  ‚ÄúWe had made some sketches with accurate dimensions, and then I explained how much space we had available and how we had placed the tables, and then I asked her [the ergonomist] if it was all right in relation to legislation. We talked back and forth and realized that we had to redo the layout sketches, because it turned out that there was not enough space in the proposal we had made. It was absolutely great that we had involved her [the ergonomist].‚Äù  At some meetings, a draftsman also participated and adjusted the layout sketches as new ideas for the layout arose. The ergon- omist explained:  ‚Äú. I was to relate to the layout proposal and evaluate whether or not the proposal met ergonomic requirements. It was a lot of fun. Sometimes, when we had meetings, a draftsman partici- pated and then we talked through the sketches and had new suggestions. Well, then she [the draftsman] just entered the drawing programs and came back with new sketches right away. That was amazing, because we were able to say ‚Äòokay, that part is good, but that means that.‚Äô. It worked very well.‚Äù  The on-the-spot adjustments supported the dialog and helped to clarify pros and cons of different layout solutions. Based on the layout sketches, the ergonomist, C1 and the project manager addressed a number of issues such as space, glare caused by sun coming through the windows, and noise from washing machines. The layout sketches also helped them address consequences of the different design suggestions and bring forward their different professional viewpoints. Based on these discussions, the layout was adjusted. The version agreed on by all three design actors ended up being the layout that was recommended to the hospital (see Fig. 1).  Based on an inductive analysis approach (Thomas, 2006), all transcriptions and the selected documents were coded for the theme ‚Äúwritten objects used to integrate ergonomic knowledge in the design process‚Äù. After identifying all text segments related to this theme, we started going back and forth between the data  3.2.  The ergonomic guideline document  The development of the EGD was based on the discussions be- tween the ergonomist, C1 and the project manager. As the ergon- omist said:

It was important to get it in writing as well e all those considerations.‚Äù  The ergonomist was the main author of the EGD. C1 and the project manager also wrote some paragraphs in the document. The ergonomist also contacted a colleague in the ergonomics depart- ment who contributed a paragraph on indoor environment, noise and acoustics to the report. Table 2 presents the content of the EGD. The main issues in the document were workplace and work- station design revolving around physiological and physical aspects of ergonomics. The document‚Äôs recommendations were based on six guidelines issued by the Danish Working Environment Au- thority (WEA). WEA is an agency under the Danish Ministry of Employment and has the authority to draw up rules on occupa- tional health and safety (OHS), provide information about OHS and carry out inspections of companies. The WEA guidelines are all ‚Äúeasy-to-understand‚Äù guides for grasping legislation on OHS and workplace design in Denmark. In some paragraphs of the EGD, the ergonomist quoted the WEA guidelines verbatim, and in other paragraphs, she translated the guidelines and related them to the work practice she expected at the sterile processing plant. Throughout the EGD, the ergonomist also referred to the layout sketch, which is presented in the docu- ment‚Äôs appendix. Focusing on the formulations in the EGD, we found that more than half of the recommendations were generally  Table 2 Content of the EGD.  Main sections in the document  1.  2.

There were also recom-  recommendations  the  in  mendations where speciÔ¨Åc measures for recommended distances were given. After having completed the EGD, the ergonomist handed it over to C1 and the project manager. She then left the project. C1 and the project manager then circulated the EGD, including the layout sketch, to actors in the hospital organization and to the hospital‚Äôs contractor. At the hospital, the EGD was given to the manager of the technical department, the manager of the sterile processing plant, a health and safety representative and an ergonomist. The EGD was also given to C2, who used the EGD in her consultancy work.  3.3.  The completed plant  When the Ô¨Årst author visited the sterile processing plant, the plant was still in the start-up phase and had been running on and off for six months. Observations and interviews with employees revealed that they were pleased with some aspects, but they also experienced problems in a number of areas. Comparing the rec- ommended layout and recommendations in the EGD with the actual layout and work practice in the sterile processing plant showed that some of the recommendations had been complied with, while others had not. In Table 3, the main recommendations are related to the Ô¨Åndings in the sterile processing plant. Interviews with C2 and the daily leader at the sterile processing plant indicated why some of the recommendations were not transferred to the Ô¨Ånal design. For example, it was recommended that the transportation vehicles be equipped with handles, but in the speciÔ¨Åcation requirement for the transportation cart, the han- dles were not included:  C2: ‚ÄúThere are no handles. [The hospital] distinctly deselected the handles. They don‚Äôt make sense. They are extra, take up space, and they would mean that there would be room for fewer carts in the lift. And no matter whether you are short or tall, you can just push by, holding on to the racks of the cart.  Interviewer: ‚ÄúSo someone has simply deselected the handles?‚Äù  C2: ‚ÄúI participated. .I requirements.‚Äù  have made  all  the  speciÔ¨Åcation

Interviewer: ‚ÄúDid you contact an ergonomist who then said, ‚Äòyes, with or without the handles e that doesn‚Äôt really make a difference‚Äô?‚Äù  C2: ‚ÄúNo, that is a judgment we made. You know, about ergonomics. It also has to do with Ô¨Ånance.‚Äù  it‚Äôs not  just  Considerations of both Ô¨Ånancial aspects and overall efÔ¨Åciency of work practice were used as arguments for not including the ergo- nomic recommendations in the speciÔ¨Åcation requirement. Another example is related to a recommendation to implement a self- propelled cart for transportation to and from the sterile process- ing plant, due to the sloping Ô¨Çoor in a tunnel connected to the sterile processing plant. C2 argued that the recommendation did not make sense:  C2: ‚ÄúIt is an extremely expensive solution. Well, actually, I think it is Ô¨Åne to recommend it.. To me the recommendation says that when a cart has been packed, then it should be placed on a robot, which then takes it to the sterile processing plant and drops it off.. I think it sounds reasonable, but can you imag- ine. a robot going down that aisle with all those cabinets and people going back and forth.. The robot would have to stop a hundred times.. It wouldn‚Äôt work, really.. At least, I think that‚Äôs what it means e without really knowing for sure..‚Äù  In this example, the ergonomist‚Äôs recommendation for a self- propelled cart is interpreted by C2 as a robot and consequently rejected as being unworkable and too expensive. A follow-up interview with the ergonomist revealed, however, that she never intended to recommend a robot. Rather, her recommendation was a  transportation cart with an electric motor that could create pro- pulsion, but would be steered by the employees. Interviews and observations also revealed that there were issues related to the working environment that were not addressed in the EGD. For example, the sterile processing plant‚Äôs employees and daily leader experienced problems related to the psychosocial working environment during the start-up phase, when a whole new group of employees were brought together; they also became aware that many chemical issues needed to be considered; and they experienced communication problems with the surgery units. Also, there was no break room for the employees.  4. Discussion  In the following, we mobilize the theoretical concepts by relating them to the Ô¨Åndings presented above, and we illuminate how the objects played a role in integrating ergonomics in the design process.  4.1.  The layout sketches  During the meetings between the ergonomist, C1, and the project manager, the layout sketches served as boundary objects. They helped facilitate a constructive dialog between the three ac- tors, and helped make the design object more tangible. Drawing on Carlile‚Äôs (2002) characteristics of an effective boundary object, we Ô¨Ånd that the layout sketches were able to establish ‚Äúa shared syntax (Carlile, 2002, pp. 451e452) across the different knowledge domains, and this enabled the ergonomist to contribute  language‚Äù  or

With the layout sketches placed in the middle, the three actors were able to discuss the pros and cons of different solutions. During these discussions, they ‚Äúlearned  about  their differences and dependencies‚Äù (Carlile, 2002, pp. 451e  enabled the actors to ‚Äújointly transform their knowledge‚Äù  452): The project manager contributed with knowledge on engi- neering design; C1 contributed with her practical knowledge about the work processes and Ô¨Çow in a sterile processing plant; and the ergonomist contributed her knowledge on ergonomics and the Danish OHS legislation. Even though they were not able to fully understand each other‚Äôs work practice, they were able to comple- ment each other. The layout sketches facilitated this process and (Carlile, 2002, pp. 451e452) and their professional views into a layout. The ergonomist‚Äôs involvement led to changes in the layout (tables etc. were moved), and through dialog the three actors were able to agree to a layout they could jointly recommend. Using the layout sketches as a boundary object helped to inte- grate ergonomic knowledge into the engineering design process, but the study also revealed some limitations. The ergonomist explained that especially the meetings where a draftsman partici- pated had worked well. We can address this Ô¨Ånding by applying the distinction between ‚Äòopen‚Äô and ‚Äòclosed‚Äô objects (Vinck et al., 1996). The draftsman‚Äôs involvement in the meetings created an ‚Äòopen‚Äô boundary object, because the draftsman was able to make changes in the layout as the dialog unfolded. This enabled C1, the ergonomist and the project manager to explore and elaborate different solutions during the meetings. When the draftsman did not participate, the dialog between the three actors was based on a ‚Äútraditional layout sketch‚Äù, which constitutes a ‚Äòclosed‚Äô boundary object. They were able to discuss the presented solution, but they were not able to make on-the-spot changes and thereby clarify pros and cons. Broberg et al. (2011) also draw on the distinction between open and closed objects and argue that an open object allows a transformation of the object, which enables participants to design with the objects. When the Ô¨Ånal layout was agreed upon, it was handed over to the hospital and its construction contractor. The role of the layout sketch now changed from being a boundary object to being an intermediary object. The layout sketch communicated the recom- mended layout to the downstream actors in the design process. This can be seen as an attempt to produce a distant effect on the sterile processing plant‚Äôs layout. The downstream actors were supposed to transfer the recommended layout, including the er- gonomic recommendations embedded in the layout sketches. However, as presented in the result section, adjustments were made to the packing area and the sterile area. Evidently, the design process continued during the implementation of the recommended layout, and as an intermediary object, the layout sketch was not able to perform a distant effect on all areas of the sterile processing plant.  4.2.  The ergonomic guideline document  In the EGD, the ergonomist stated recommendations for the future design of the sterile processing plant. The intent of the document was to pass on ergonomic knowledge in the further design processes. This can be seen as an attempt to produce a distant effect, since the ergonomist did not participate in the remaining design phases in person. However, the document was not able to perform the full distant effect the project team had hoped for. Some of the recommendations were transferred to the design of the sterile processing plant, while others were trans- Furthermore, some ergonomic aspects had not been addressed in the document. These Ô¨Åndings indicate that using an EGD to pass on ergonomic knowledge in a design process has some limitations. This is also indicated in studies on ergonomic  formed.  like Burns and Vicente (1994) and  information transfer in design, Burns et al. (1997). In the following, we address the Ô¨Åndings in this study, and, guided by the concept of intermediary object, we focus on the role of the EGD e Ô¨Årst by focusing on the framing of the ergonomic knowledge in the EGD and the network participating in making the document; and subsequently, by analyzing why some guidelines in the document were transferred, while others were transformed.  4.2.1. The framing of ergonomic knowledge in the ergonomic guideline document  The actors who participated in making the EGD wanted to create a sterile processing plant with a safe working environment that complied with existing legislation on OHS. The content of the EGD reveals that not all aspects of ergonomics were addressed. A framing of ergonomic knowledge had taken place, and only areas related to the human musculoskeletal system and to a minor de- gree, the physical aspects of ergonomics were addressed in the document. Issues related to psychosocial or chemical aspects were not addressed. Drawing attention to the network participating in making the document we Ô¨Ånd that the framing of the ergonomic knowledge begun even before the ergonomist entered the project. The engi- neering design team was hired to ‚Äúdesign the layout and logistics of the sterile processing plant‚Äù. Given this scope, the design team‚Äôs focus was capacity analysis, layout of the sterile processing plant, and Ô¨Çow of the future work processes. This scope of the design job indicates that the predominant view of the sterile processing plant was of a physical container for work processes. This view was also found among the ergonomist involved in the design job: a phys- iotherapist was assigned and only issues related to the musculo- skeletal system and physical aspects of ergonomics were addressed and circulated to other actors in the design process. We argue that a different scope of the engineering design job e for instance, to design a new department for sterile processing e might have created an opening toward integrating more organizational/psy- chosocial aspects of ergonomics. Using layout sketches as a boundary object may have contributed to the framing, since the interviews revealed that the layout sketches primarily encouraged input and suggestions related to the physical set-up of the sterile processing plant. The appointment of a physiotherapist as the ergonomist to participate in the design project may also have contributed to the speciÔ¨Åc ergonomic framing. We also identiÔ¨Åed a great deal of focus on legislation in the EGD. Throughout the EGD, the ergonomist based her recommendations on the WEA guidelines. By referring to these guidelines, the ergonomist drew on the ergonomic knowledge of the different networks that participated over time in making the WEA guidelines in developing the OHS legislation. Hence, the ergonomic knowledge mobilized by the ergonomist is institutionalized ergo- nomic knowledge, and her references to the WEA guidelines can be seen as an attempt to make the document more powerful and in- crease its chances of producing a distant effect on the further design process.  and  4.2.2.  Transformation of  the guidelines  The main arguments given for disregarding guidelines were related to either cost, hygiene, space or efÔ¨Åciency of the workplace. This Ô¨Ånding is in line with Wulff et al. (1999b), who also found time and costs to be the main constraints in relation to implementation of ergonomic recommendations. We found that the guidelines were transformed when they did not make sense within the downstream actors‚Äô rationale. When discussing the guidelines with C2, she often stated that ""...it does not make any sense"" for example, the handles for the  e

This can be explained through the notion of ‚Äúsocial worlds‚Äù as put forth in the work of Star and Griesemer (1989) and Garrety and Badham (1999). Actors from different dis- ciplines come from different social worlds; thus, they have different ways of seeing the design object in question, which can create a semantic mismatch. When recommendations are solely based on a guideline document, they may be transformed in the processes of translation, despite references given to the WEA guidelines. We also identiÔ¨Åed an example where a guideline was rejected due to a misinterpretation: The notion self-propelled cart was interpreted as a robot, which was viewed as unworkable. The document failed to elaborate or explain the underlying rationale and intentions behind this guideline. Hence we support Wulff et al. (1999b), who found that there can be a problem in using ‚Äúhealth and safety documents‚Äù to pass on ergonomic knowledge, in that the docu- ments do not clarify how to optimize when different criteria are conÔ¨Çicting e or when there is a misinterpretation. Other authors have found that recommendations in ergonomic standards are often ignored, due to vague or general formulations (Broberg, 2007; Burns et al., 1997; Rogers and Armstrong, 1977; Wulff et al., 1999a,b). Wulff et al. (1999a,b) found that generally formulated recommendations leave the designer with a translation problem of how to transfer a general recommendation to a speciÔ¨Åc design solution. They suggest that ergonomic criteria should be formulated as speciÔ¨Åc requirements. Relating this to the distinction between open and closed objects introduced by Vinck et al. (1996), the suggestion can be seen as an attempt to create a ‚Äòmore‚Äô closed object. In present study, we found that some of the speciÔ¨Åc rec- ommendations were transferred to the sterile processing plant, while others were transformed. The same was true for the general recommendations. Both the speciÔ¨Åcally and the generally formu- lated guidelines in the EGD seemed to be interpreted as ‚Äòopen‚Äô recommendations e and not as ‚Äòclosed‚Äô requirements that had to be complied with.  4.2.3.  Limitations in the use and design of  the guideline document  The above Ô¨Ånding directs our attention to the intermediary object itself, and indicates that a written object, like the EGD, has limitations beyond the formulations of the guidelines. The EGD was created as a ‚Äòclosed‚Äô object with speciÔ¨Åc focus on passing on ergo- nomic guidelines in the design process, but even so, downstream actors experienced a freedom of use and regarded the document as ‚Äòopen‚Äô. There seems to be an embedded Ô¨Çexibility in the EGD in relation to the use of guideline documents per se, and there also appears to be limitations related to the design of the document. Burns et al. (1997) studied interfaces between research literature and designers and argued that the design of intermediaries should be based on the characteristics of designers and the constraints of the environment in which the guidelines are supposed to be used. If too little attention is paid to this matter, the guidelines might not be used. We did not Ô¨Ånd any evidence showing that C1, the ergonomist and the project manager had given any thought to what kind of obstacles the document might meet in the further design process and how these obstacles could be overcome. In line with Wulff et al. (1999a,b) and Concei√ß√£o et al. (2012), we argue that the use of written objects to transfer ergonomic knowledge in design pro- cesses needs to be supported by organizational initiatives e for instance, by establishing a hotline for ergonomic support when designers experience conÔ¨Çicting criteria, or through involvement of an ergonomist throughout the design process.  4.3.  Limitations of  the case study  A single-case study was chosen, since the aim of the study was to explore and gain in-depth understanding of the role of written  objects in integrating ergonomics in engineering design processes. However, a limitation of a single-case study is that the Ô¨Åndings cannot be generalized to a larger population (Thomas, 2011). The case study was also conducted retrospectively. Doing a case study retrospectively implies interviewing people about incidents in the past. In some cases, the interviewee had problems remembering what really happened in the design process. The interviewee might also have a ‚Äòselective memory‚Äô. For instance, they might retell the case in the way they remember it, but this may not necessarily be how the case actually unfolded. Another limitation is that two of those interviewed left the engineering consultancy Ô¨Årm during the period of data collection, which limited the possibility to do follow- up interviews. For further research, it would be interesting to make a longitudinal study, where it would be possible to observe a design team during design situations either as an anthropological study or as an action research study.  5.  Concluding remarks  We argue that objects can play an important and often unrec- ognized role in the integration of ergonomic knowledge in a design process. In the role of a boundary object, layout sketches, particu- larly when they were melleable, helped to facilitate dialog between the involved actors and bring ergonomic knowledge into action in the design process. In the role of an intermediary object, an ergo- nomic guideline document was intended to transfer ergonomic knowledge to other actors in the design process. The study shows, however, that the ergonomic guideline document had some limi- tations in fulÔ¨Ålling this role. When downstream actors experienced a conÔ¨Çict between a guideline and other design criteria, the docu- ment was not able to enter into a negotiation process and elaborate or explain the underlying reasons for the ergonomic guideline. As a consequence, some of the given ergonomic guidelines were transformed by downstream actors. Finally, the study also shows that throughout a design process the same object may have different roles and function both as a boundary object in direct communication between involved actors and as an intermediary object that functions as a means of transferring ergonomic knowledge to downstream actors in the design process.  5.1.  Implications  This study suggests the following implications for practitioners:  - When planning to integrate ergonomic aspects in design pro- cesses ergonomists and engineering designers should discuss and map how objects, like texts, drawings, and spaces, can help integrate ergonomic knowledge. Objects should be classiÔ¨Åed either as boundary or intermediary objects (or both) in order to better understand the potential role they might play in the design process. - Boundary objects that are open for ‚Äòon-the-spot‚Äô visualization of different design possibilities are better able to support dialog between the ergonomist and engineering designers. - When designing an intermediary object, ergonomists and en- gineering designers need to look ahead in the design process and consider what kind of obstacles the intermediary object could meet on its way, and evaluate how such obstacles might be overcome e for example, by including the aim or reasoning behind a guidelines in the intermediary object to minimize misinterpretations and/or by arranging follow-up dialogs dur- ing design, construction, and implementation phases, where decisions affecting the work conditions are also made. - Ergonomists should also pay attention to the framing of ergo- nomic issues, as both the choice of boundary object and  
654  L.B. Hall-Andersen, O. Broberg / Applied Ergonomics 45 (2014) 647e654  intermediary object may affect the framing of the ergonomic issues that is brought into action in the design process. The er- gonomic issues that are important to address may vary depending on the scope of the design task, the design process and the organizational context.  References  Boujut, J., Blanco, E., 2003.

s0003687013001804,"  In recent years, the investigation of driver distraction has become a highly important issue in road safety. Driver distraction has detrimental effects on a variety of driving-related variables (see Regan et al., 2009 for an overview), and has been reported to play an important role in trafÔ¨Åc crashes (Stutts et al., 2001). While ac- tivities like smoking or eating while driving have been common for decades, so called ‚Äútechnology-based distraction‚Äù (Young et al., 2003) has come into focus only since navigation systems, mobile phones and related devices have entered daily life, and conse- quently, our vehicles. Given that in-vehicle information systems (IVIS) and other related devices have become increasingly popular (Buettner, 2009), and that they are reported to be used frequently while driving (Pickrell and Ye, 2011), it is not surprising that re- searchers have started to develop easy-to-use methods to investi- gate the extent to which the operation of a certain device is distracting. One of these easy-to-use tools is the lane change task (LCT; Mattes, 2003). The LCT is a simple and inexpensive dual task method which is used in a laboratory setting to estimate secondary  * Corresponding author. Tel.: √æ49 (0) 371 531 36519; fax: √æ49 (0) 371 531 836519.

The task employs the look and feel of a simple driving simulation (Fig. 1), which mainly consists of a three-lane road, with no other trafÔ¨Åc present, and a set of signs appearing on both sides of this road which instruct the participants to change lanes. Partici- pants are required to control a simulated vehicle and change lanes according to the information on the signs while maintaining a constant speed of 60 km/h which cannot be exceeded. The signs appear around every 150 m; duration between lane changes is around 9 s. Main performance measures are the mean deviation (MDEV) from a normative lane change model, or the MDEV from an adaptive model which is based on the participants‚Äô own baseline drive. The LCT has been investigated quite thoroughly already (e.g. Bruyas et al., 2008; Engstrom and Markkula, 2007; Harbluk et al., 2009, 2007; Huemer and Vollrath, 2010; Petzoldt et al., 2009), and has subsequently become an ISO standardised procedure (ISO/ DIS 26022, 2010). Still, there are open questions like which metrics are most appropriate for which kind of distraction, or how to instruct participants properly to generate reliable and valid data (Young et al., 2011). Another issue that has been raised is the potential inÔ¨Çuence of previous LCT experience (Huemer and Vollrath, 2012; Petzoldt et al., 2011). During the early stage evaluation of in-vehicle in- formation systems, it would not be uncommon that participants are drawn from a pool of people that is regularly recruited for  0003-6870/$ e see front matter √ì 2013 Elsevier Ltd and The Ergonomics Society.

640  T. Petzoldt et al.  / Applied Ergonomics 45 (2014) 639e646  SuRT, which only requires intermittent monitoring, the CTT re- quires a more or less continuous devotion of attention. With an experimental setup comparable to the previous experiment, no improvements in LCT performance were found. However, for the CTT, substantial performance increments in the dual task training were observed. Petzoldt et al. (2011) addressed potential learning effects in two similar studies. In their Ô¨Årst experiment, they tested the effects of single task and dual task training on LCT and sec- ondary task performance. Participants either received i) no training, ii) a single task LCT training, or iii) a dual task training with LCT √æ SuRT and LCT √æ CTT. In a test phase one week after the initial training, all three groups completed several dual task trials of LCT √æ SuRT and LCT √æ CTT with various levels of secondary task difÔ¨Åculty (identical to the training phase for the dual task training group). Overall, the results supported the view that both primary and secondary task performance improve with training, with stronger effects for the dual task training. In the second experiment, the period between training and test phase was extended to 4e7 months. The procedure remained largely unchanged, except for the fact that only the CTT was used as a secondary task. Again, per- formance improvements were found for both LCT and secondary task, which indicates that the training effects found previously are rather stable. While the results in general indicate that previous LCT exposure might be an issue, the described experiments have certain short- comings that limit the extent to which these results can be generalised. One problem is the use of artiÔ¨Åcial secondary tasks, although they arguably have their advantages. They are overall quite standardised, and the level of difÔ¨Åculty is easy to manipulate. However, the fact that they are only artiÔ¨Åcial gives rise to the question of whether the results obtained are applicable to realistic secondary tasks as well. While the components of demand (usually visual and motor interaction with the task) are similar, complexity might be higher for realistic tasks, which certainly would result in different patterns at least for the learning curve, if not for learning effects in general. Also, the fact that the same secondary tasks are employed repeatedly appears to be somewhat unrealistic. While it is true that subjects are repeatedly drawn out of the same pools of potential participants, it is unlikely that they will be used to test the same systems over and over again. Hence, it is necessary not only to assess if there is any learning effect for LCT use in conjunction with a realistic secondary task, but also whether there is transfer of learning from one secondary task to another. To address these is- sues, two experiments were conducted.  2.  Experiment I  In a Ô¨Årst experiment, we sought to Ô¨Ånd evidence that the learning effects found in previous studies also occur when combining the LCT with a realistic secondary task. Considering the impressive sales Ô¨Ågures for both portable (GfK Retail and Technology, 2009) and factory (J.D. Power and Associates, 2010) installed navigation devices, entering destinations into a navigation system was chosen as the secondary task. We decided to use a simple repeated measures design, as this most closely resembled the described problem of repeated use of the same participants when testing in-vehicle information systems.  2.1. Method  2.1.1.  Participants  Twenty students from Chemnitz University of Technology took part in this experiment. Sixteen participants were female and 4 were male, with a mean age of 21.6 years (SD ¬º 2.7). All possessed a valid driving licence.  Fig. 1.  Lane change task (LCT); example screen.  similar studies, and thus might be repeatedly assigned to LCT experiments. The question then is if previous experience leads to effects that alter LCT performance in a way that makes it incom- parable to results obtained elsewhere. Evidence from various studies supports this assumption. In a simulator experiment, Shinar et al. (2005) found that after a sufÔ¨Åcient amount of practice in using a mobile phone while driving, learning effects led to a decrease in driving impairment. Chisholm et al. (2008) investi- gated the effects of practice in using an IPod while driving on driving performance. They found that over the course of six ses- sions, event detection improved considerably, although not to a safe level. Also secondary task performance beneÔ¨Åts from repeated practice, as Jahn et al. (2009) reported in their study on skill acquisition in operating navigation systems. An early study by Brown and Poulton (1961) showed that driver performance on an auditory secondary task while driving improved remarkably over the course of several dual task trials. It has generally been argued that such improvements can be the result of improved single task performance (‚Äúintratask automaticity‚Äù), but also opti- mised resource allocation between the tasks (‚Äúintertask resource deployment strategies‚Äù, Brown and Carr, 1989). Brown (1998) emphasised that dual task practice promotes time sharing. Damos and Wickens (1980) conÔ¨Årmed that such learning effects occur, and that they even might transfer to other task combina- tions. But, while gaining experience and learning to allocate re- sources in an optimal way are good for road safety in general, for the assessment of the distraction potential of in-vehicle infor- mation systems, this is somewhat problematic. Huemer and Vollrath (2012) addressed the issue of learning effects in the LCT in three experiments. In the Ô¨Årst experiment, they investigated the development of LCT single task performance as a function of training. Although participants appeared to reach their optimum level of performance rather fast, a signiÔ¨Åcant increase in performance was observed especially from the Ô¨Årst to the second trial. Experiment II addressed different training regimes and their effects on dual task performance. Using the so called surrogate reference task (SuRT; Mattes and Hall√©n, 2009), a self paced visual secondary task, they tested effects of blocked single task, alter- nating single task and dual task training. Again, they found per- formance improvements over time, for both the LCT and the secondary task. Interestingly, the different training regimes resul- ted in different patterns of performance development. More important, however, was that, again, effects occurred. In their Ô¨Ånal experiment, they substituted the SuRT for another secondary task, the critical tracking task (CTT; Jex et al., 1966). Different from the

The vehicle was controlled with a MOMO force-feedback game steering wheel with foot pedals. The length of a single LCT trial corresponded to the length of one LCT track (1800 m) which took roughly 3 min, pro- vided the participants followed instructions. Any secondary task was stopped as soon as the end of the track was reached. The main performance measure used in this experiment was mean deviation (MDEV) from an adaptive lane change model based on a partici- pants‚Äô baseline drive (as recommended by ISO/DIS 26022, 2010). For the navigation system destination entry task, a ‚ÄúNavigon 20 Easy‚Äù system was used. Participants had to enter different ad- dresses (city, street, and number) using the system‚Äôs touch screen. The addresses were presented in written form before the beginning of a trial, and stayed visible once the trial started. Addresses had to be entered character by character. Once the required destination appeared on the screen, participants were allowed to select it without adding further characters. Addresses were designed in a way that the entry could be completed using 9e11 characters. As an instrument to assess the load subjectively experienced by the participants, the DALI (Pauzie and Pachiaudi, 1997) was used. This questionnaire is derived from the NASA-TLX (Hart and Staveland, 1988) and is speciÔ¨Åcally designed to capture the work- load experienced while driving with an additional task. Five of the questionnaire‚Äôs seven scales that were suitable were selected: global attention demand, visual demand, stress, temporal demand, and interference. The auditory demand and tactile demand sub- scales (speciÔ¨Åc constraints induced by vibrations during the test) were omitted, as they were irrelevant in the chosen experimental setup (no auditory or tactile demand present).  2.1.3.  Procedure  Participants completed two identical testing sessions which were one week apart. In each session, they started with practice trials of the LCT. In accordance to ISO (ISO/DIS 26022, 2010) rec- ommendations, participants practised LCT driving until they ach- ieved an MDEV < .7 using the adaptive model. The navigation system destination entry was practised as a single task until par- ticipants felt comfortable, followed by one practice trial with both tasks in parallel. Then, they completed one baseline trial (LCT as a single task) and three trials of the dual task situation. After that, they answered the DALI questionnaire and provided demographic information. Overall, one session took about 30 min.  2.2.  Results  In Fig. 2, MDEV values (adaptive model) are displayed for the baseline and the dual task trials (a mean value was computed for the three trials) for the two test sessions. Adaptive MDEV was calculated using the respective baselines of each individual session (i.e. session one baseline for Ô¨Årst session data, session two baseline for second session data). As the focus of this experiment was learning effects, we compared the MDEV values of the Ô¨Årst and the second session for both baseline and the dual task situation with t- tests for dependent measures. As Fig. 2 indicates, there was a highly signiÔ¨Åcant difference between session one and session two for the trials in which the secondary task had to be operated, t(19) ¬º 5.30, p < .001, d ¬º 1.19. Also baseline performance differed signiÔ¨Åcantly between sessions, t(19) ¬º 2.74, p ¬º .013, d ¬º .61. Interestingly, when looking at the three dual task trials sepa- rately for each session (see Fig. 3), there appears to be no positive development during the sessions. Only in the Ô¨Årst session, perfor- mance seems to improve slightly in the third trial, however far from statistical relevance. For the second session, no improvement is visible at all.  Fig. 2.

Discussion  Our Ô¨Årst experiment provided further evidence for the assumption that previous LCT experience might facilitate perfor- mance in the LCT as well as a given secondary task. Although the initial exposure to the dual task situation encompassed only few trials, we found substantial learning effects both for the LCT as a single task, and for the LCT in the dual task situation. Moreover, secondary task performance also beneÔ¨Åtted from the previous experience. Interestingly, these improvements are hardly reÔ¨Çected in the participants‚Äô subjective assessments of the dual task situa- tion. Only the scale ‚Äúinterference‚Äù showed a reduction of perceived  Fig. 3. MDEV values in the three dual task trials for both sessions (error bars indicate standard error).

Target and distracters are white circles in front of a black background (Fig. 5). Participants respond by moving a vertical grey indicator bar to the position of the identiÔ¨Åed target and pressing the enter key for conÔ¨Årmation, followed by the next display. For this experiment, we used a rather simple version of the task. Distracters were 4 mm in diameter .46 ), (visual angle approx. the target was 8 mm (visual angle .92 ), with only two indicator bar sections. The task was approx. presented on an 8.3700 screen to the right of the participants, in a position where an aftermarket navigation system would typically be put. As a ‚Äúnear transfer‚Äù task, we employed a destination entry task on a mobile phone navigation system (To avoid confusion, we will use the term ‚Äúmobile phone task‚Äù from here on. Still, we want to emphasise that the mobile phone task is essentially a destination entry task, similar to the destination entry on the navigations system, only on a different device.). The phone used was a Nokia N70 with navigation software. Just like for the navigation system destination entry task, participants had to enter different addresses (city, street, and number) with the phone. The menu structure was similar to the portable navigation system. However, due to the fact that the phone we used did not have a touch screen, destination entry had to be completed using the phone‚Äôs keys. Therefore, while the destination entry tasks on the navigation system and the mo- bile phone shared several key components, they were not identical.  3.1.3.  Procedure  The near and far transfer groups participated in a learning phase that was completed one week before actual testing. We tried to keep the amount of practice similar to the Ô¨Årst session of Experi- ment I, and therefore followed the same procedure. Participants started with practice trials of the LCT (again until adaptive MDEV < .7) and the respective secondary task (SuRT or mobile phone task) as single tasks, followed by a practice trial with both tasks in parallel. Then, they completed another single task trial (as a baseline trial) of the LCT and three trials of the dual task situation. The test session was identical for all three groups and followed Experiment I (Section 2.1.3), using the navigation system destina- tion entry as a secondary task. Again, there was a short practice phase for the single tasks (LCT until performance threshold was reached, secondary task until participants felt comfortable) and the dual task situation (one trial), before one baseline trial and three dual task trials were recorded and the questionnaires (DALI and  Fig. 5.

The fact that perceived interference decreased, however, strengthens the claim that previous dual task experience is not only relevant for the performance in the respective tasks, but also for the optimal allocation of attention between them.  3.  Experiment II  Based on the Ô¨Ånding that dual task experience with artiÔ¨Åcial (Petzoldt et al., 2011) and realistic (Experiment I) secondary tasks positively affects performance in subsequent encounters with the same dual task situation, in our second experiment, we focussed on the potential transfer of learning effects from one secondary task to another. Similar to Experiment I, participants should be exposed twice to the LCT and a secondary task, with the Ô¨Årst session serving as a learning phase for the second session (test session). However, while the secondary task in the second session was the same for all participants, the secondary tasks for the learning phase differed one from another, and, more importantly, also differed from the secondary task in the test session. To Ô¨Ånd out whether transfer occurs, we chose secondary tasks that shared aspects with the secondary task of the test session to a varying degree. We called them ‚Äúnear transfer‚Äù (for a secondary task very similar to the task in the test phase) and ‚Äúfar transfer‚Äù (for a secondary task of limited similarity to the task in the test phase) tasks. Different from Experiment I, we used a between subjects design (control group, far transfer, near transfer).  3.1. Method  3.1.1.  Participants  Fifty-nine students from Chemnitz University of Technology took part in the second experiment. Forty-eight participants were female and 11 were male, with a mean age of 22.7 years (SD ¬º 3.5). Again, all of them possessed a valid driving licence.  3.1.2. Material  The LCT and its setup employed for this experiment were identical to the previous experiment (see Section 2.1.2). Also the navigation system destination entry task was directly taken from Experiment I. The DALI was again used to assess ratings of sub- jective workload. As one of the secondary tasks for the learning phase, the sur- rogate reference task (SuRT; Mattes and Hall√©n, 2009) was employed. It is rather artiÔ¨Åcial, and considered a ‚Äúfar transfer‚Äù task in relation to real life navigation systems tasks. It requires the

Results  In Fig. 6, MDEV values (adaptive model) in the test session are displayed for the baseline and the navigation system task for the three groups. As in Experiment I, the goal was not to compare the baseline to the navigation system task, but rather study the effect that experience has on these experimental conditions. Therefore, we compared the MDEV values of the three groups for both base- line and the navigation system task in two separate between- subjects ANOVAs. The analysis showed no signiÔ¨Åcant differences between the three baselines, F(2, 56) ¬º 1.13, p ¬º .330, h2 ¬º .04. Similarly, the MDEV values in the navigation system task did not differ signiÔ¨Åcantly, F(2, 56) ¬º .56, p ¬º .574, h2 ¬º .02. We also looked into the performance in the three dual task trials separately (see Fig. 7). Again, there is no clear evidence for learning effects during testing. Similar to the Ô¨Årst session in Experiment I, untrained participants‚Äô performance seemed to improve slightly, whereas for the two other groups, performance appeared to get even worse in the Ô¨Ånal trial. However, none of these impressions could be conÔ¨Årmed in a statistical analysis. As can be seen in Fig. 8, previous practice did, however, impact on secondary task performance, measured as the average number of navigation system entries completed per trial, F(2, 56) ¬º 3.94, p ¬º .025, h2 ¬º .12. Post-hoc comparisons (Bonferroni-corrected) showed a signiÔ¨Åcant difference between the control group and the group that completed the mobile phone task during the learning phase (p ¬º .030, d ¬º .78), with no signiÔ¨Åcant difference but a me- dium size effect for the comparison of the two groups that completed a learning phase (p ¬º .129, d ¬º .64). Fig. 9 shows the results for the subjective assessment of the dual task situation (LCT √æ navigation system entry) for all three groups. As expected, the group that completed the mobile phone task during the learning phase scored lowest throughout. Interestingly, though, the group that learned with the SuRT produced rather high ratings on several scales. Between subjects ANOVAs uncovered signiÔ¨Åcant differences for the scales ‚Äúglobal attention demand‚Äù F(2, 56) ¬º 5.74, p ¬º .005, h2 ¬º .17, and ‚Äúvisual demand‚Äù, F(2, 56) ¬º 5.169, p ¬º .009, h2 ¬º .16. Post-hoc comparisons (Bonferroni-corrected) showed a signiÔ¨Åcant difference between the SuRT group and the mobile phone task group for both scales (p ¬º .004, d ¬º 1.10 and p ¬º .010, d ¬º 1.10).  Fig. 7. MDEV values in the three dual task trials for the different experimental con- ditions (error bars indicate standard error).  3.3. Discussion  In our second experiment, we tried to Ô¨Ånd evidence that the learning effects found previously transfer to other dual task com- binations. The results are mixed. LCT performance in the dual task situation did not show any improvements, regardless of training type. However, the LCT ISO standard (ISO/DIS 26022, 2010) em- phasises the relevance not only of LCT, but also of secondary task performance for the proper assessment of distraction. And with regard to secondary task performance, signiÔ¨Åcant differences be- tween the groups were uncovered. It appeared that especially the near transfer group beneÔ¨Åtted from the dual task training, as it was able to complete signiÔ¨Åcantly more navigation system address entries than the control group. It has been pointed out before that risk exposure is directly related to secondary task duration (Wierwille and Tijerina, 1998), and that therefore the duration of a distracting activity might be just as important as its intensity (Burns et al., 2010). In line with this argument, it can be assumed that although LCT performance did not improve, distraction nevertheless decreased as a result of previous dual task experience for the near transfer group. If distraction would be assessed strictly following the ISO protocol, which recommends the use of both LCT and secondary task data, the conclusions that would be drawn would be compromised as a result of the previous LCT experience.

644  T. Petzoldt et al.  / Applied Ergonomics 45 (2014) 639e646  argued before that especially variations in driver strategies regarding the allocation of attention between primary and sec- ondary task (Benedict et al., 2006) necessitate the acquisition of both MDEV and secondary task measures. An interesting question here is whether the improvement of secondary task performance is the result of a more or less conscious strategic decision (i.e. any resources to spare as a result of previous experience are willingly directed towards the secondary task). While this might be just an artefact (highly motivated participants who want to perform as good as possible e which is, from the participants‚Äô perspective, much easier to quantify in ‚Äúnumber of address entries completed‚Äù than ‚Äúlane keeping/change performance‚Äù), it might as well be a consequence of the fact that in real world driving, the aim is not to eliminate lane variance completely (i.e. perfect performance), but rather to keep variance within a subjectively safe range (Godthelp et al., 1984). Only the inclusion of information on secondary task performance would therefore allow accurate statements on driver distraction and the actual improvement through practice. It has to be acknowledged that the samples used in both ex- periments (university students) are not representative of the driver population. Mattes and Hall√©n (2009) reported that a group of younger (21e39 years) participants signiÔ¨Åcantly outperformed a group of older (40e59) subjects in various dual task combinations of LCT and a secondary task. In general, age has been shown to be negatively correlated with performance on all sorts of dual task combinations (e.g. Hartley, 2001; Korteling, 1991; Salthouse et al., 1984; for an overview see Verhaeghen et al., 2003), although the speciÔ¨Åc processes underlying this decrease in performance are still debated. More important in this context, however, is the question how age and dual task practice relate to each other. It has been reported that older participants can beneÔ¨Åt substantially from dual task training (Bherer et al., 2005; Kramer et al., 1995), often with stronger effects on performance than for younger subjects. In a study by Manes and Green (1997) who investigated driver in- terfaces in a simulator, a group of older (65e70) participants showed higher improvement in secondary task performance than a younger (21e27) group. As younger participants‚Äô performance was overall much better, the authors attributed the result to the fact that the older participants just had more room for improvement. Shinar et al. (2005) differentiated between three age groups: young (18e22), middle (30e33) and old (60e71). Young and middle aged drivers performed at similar levels for most of the variables (with the exception of the number of errors made in a distracting math operations task), and also exhibited similar practice effects. The older participants showed poorest performance overall, but also beneÔ¨Åtted stronger from practice in measures like speed variance or steering variability. Based on these Ô¨Åndings, it can be assumed that with other age groups, the effects found in our experiments would at least be the same, if not even stronger. Although the training effects found in this and other studies are somewhat problematic for the standardised assessment of the distraction potential of a given device, they are not necessarily a shortcoming. The fact that the LCT (or rather combinations of LCT √æ secondary task) is sensitive to learning effects makes it an interesting tool for the assessment of skill acquisition while oper- ating in-vehicle devices. Similar to the way Huemer and Vollrath task and for combinations of LCT √æ artiÔ¨Åcial secondary tasks, it can (2012) investigated the learning process for the LCT as a single be used to evaluate in-vehicle devices with regard to their ‚Äúlearn- ability‚Äù. Just as Jahn et al. (2009) were able to develop learning curves for the address entry in different navigation systems as single tasks (which is rather unrealistic, given the common use of those devices while driving), it would be possible to assess the learning process for the dual task situation (assuming, again, that LCT single task performance is stable already). As Jahn et al. (2009)  Fig. 9. Subjective assessment of dual task situation (error bars indicate standard error).  The subjective assessment of perceived workload showed dif- ferences between near transfer and far transfer on two scales. The fact that the near transfer group scored global and visual attention demand considerably lower than the far transfer group indicates that the extent of transfer that occurs is indeed dependent on the similarity of the secondary tasks.  4. General discussion and conclusions  We conducted two experiments to Ô¨Ånd out if the learning effects found in previous studies also occur when combining the LCT with a realistic secondary task, and if so, if there is a transfer of learning between different dual task combinations. Our Ô¨Årst experiment showed that there are substantial learning effects for both the LCT and the secondary task, similar to the Ô¨Åndings of Petzoldt et al. (2011) for artiÔ¨Åcial secondary tasks. The second experiment pro- vided evidence that some learning transfer can occur between combinations of LCT and different secondary tasks. Previous LCT √æ secondary experience on a different task combination appeared to affect secondary task performance, however only if the secondary tasks are sufÔ¨Åciently similar. Still, the fact that the rather limited exposure to the dual task combination that occurred during the training phase had a signiÔ¨Åcant inÔ¨Çuence on the performance in another combination of LCT √æ secondary task further strengthens the claim that the amount of previous experience with the LCT and respective secondary tasks should be considered carefully when recruiting participants. As Huemer and Vollrath (2012) highlight, a substantial number of training in both the LCT and the secondary task might be necessary to reach a performance plateau, and hence eliminate effects of previous experience. However, in the assess- ment of the distraction potential of any device, it might as well be relevant to not only investigate the distraction it elicits once per- formance is stable (i.e. the driver is familiar with device and envi- ronment), but also to research how distracting the device can be in a Ô¨Årst encounter. It can be assumed that especially in situations in which the driver is not familiar with the device he operates, the level of distraction is at its maximum. With regard to the potential road safety issues that follow, this Ô¨Årst encounter can be highly relevant for the assessment of driver distraction. In such cases, previous LCT experience would have to be controlled in some way. Ideally, LCT single task performance would be at a stable level (through sufÔ¨Åcient practice), while the new device should not have been operated in a dual task setup before. The fact that performance increments were found in the oper- ation of the secondary but not always in the primary task is further evidence for the relevance of secondary task duration. It has been  
T. Petzoldt et al.  / Applied Ergonomics 45 (2014) 639e646  645  pointed out, process and duration of skill acquisition might differ between devices. Hence, the assessment of ‚Äúhow long does it take until performance is stable‚Äù might be just as relevant as ‚Äúhow is performance once it is stable‚Äù. If the LCT is to be used to investigate skill acquisition in detail (unlike in the experiments presented here, which were conducted to Ô¨Ånd out whether ‚Äúunwanted‚Äù learning effects occur when employing the LCT to assess in-vehicle devices according to ISO recommendations) however, the measures that are employed have to be chosen with care. In Experiment I, adaptive MDEV was calculated using the baseline of session one for Ô¨Årst session data, and the baseline of session two for second session data, as this resembles the situation in which a participant is repeatedly asked to partake in different (and separate) LCT studies. However, that might have come at the expense of uncovering improvements in lane change performance (as opposed to lane keeping perfor- mance). An overall earlier lane change initiation in the second test session would have been incorporated in the adaptive lane change path against which the actual path is tested, and would therefore not be reÔ¨Çected in the results. While this effect is welcome from the perspective of IVIS assessment (as it means that the assessment of the IVIS in question is independent of improvements in lane change behaviour due to exposure), it is certainly an issue if the goal is the detailed study of skill acquisition. Using only the Ô¨Årst baseline drive to develop the adaptive path for all future drives is no solution as well. Individuals‚Äô variance in this Ô¨Årst baseline would be minimised and subsequent improvements in lane change performance might even look like decrements in the data, as e.g. an improved (i.e. earlier) lane change initiation would lead to a higher deviation from the adaptive path. It seems that the basic MDEV, which compares the actual travel path to a normative one, although described only as ‚Äúoptional‚Äù in the ISO standard, is the most appropriate measure when it comes to the in-depth investigation of learning processes. Of course, while the assessment of skill acquisition is interesting in itself, the implications of eventual Ô¨Åndings are of even higher practical relevance. Assuming that practice effects might occur over a wide range of in-vehicle devices, training on how to use them, also in a dual task situation, is vital. In a policy paper, the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents (RoSPA, 2007) stated that ‚ÄúThe issue of making sure that drivers receive appropriate training for the use on in-vehicle equipment is crucial‚Äù (p. 58). A detailed investigation of the learning curve for an individual device can provide important information on how such a training should look like. Stevens et al. (2002) provide several general recommenda- tions, the simplest one being to simulate system use in a stationary vehicle. They also suggest an accompanied trial drive in which the system is used under supervision or the provision of a programmed tutorial as part of the system. Initial functionality could be limited according to experience or level of aptitude. A new user might be obligated to perform a navigation system task several times (error free) while the vehicle is stationary before they are able to access those functions when the vehicle is moving. Only Ô¨Åndings on the acquisition of skills in operating the system in question can help specify the goal of a training, adjust the amount of training that is required or deÔ¨Åne a level of experience that is expected before certain functions are made accessible. If sufÔ¨Åcient care is taken, the measures that are imposed to facilitate the safe use of in-vehicle devices can be designed in a way that makes them effective and still efÔ¨Åcient enough so that they are acceptable to the user.

s0003687013001828,"  Each year, thousands of people suffer from potentially pre- ventable illnesses such as heart attack, stroke and cancer. In addi- tion to claiming lives and reducing individuals‚Äô quality of life, these illnesses also result in millions of dollars in health care costs (Peterson and Dragon, 1998; Avorn and Shrank, 2008). Screening can prevent a considerable amount of these illnesses and reduce costs (Salkeld, 2006). The number of recommended preventive screening tests has increased in the last decade, but patients‚Äô compliance with recommended health screening rates still remains low (Manne et al., 2002; Weinberg et al., 2004).

Based on CDC‚Äôs recent report, for example, only 59% of patients in the US receive the recommended colorectal cancer screening tests (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2012). These low rates may partially be due to a lack of awareness by clinicians and patients, inadequate reinforcement mechanisms for patients with regards to compliance with the recommended preventive screening guidelines, limited access to high quality of care, and Ô¨Ånancial barriers (Mosca et al., 2006). Patient-centric health information technologies (HIT) are becoming increasingly popular (Perlin et al., 2004; Sunyaev et al., 2010). To offer better care at lower costs, HIT needs to support and facilitate patient-centered care rather than focusing on isolated physician and clinician tasks (Walker and Carayon, 2009). If designed well, HIT can educate patients on health care topics, give reminders to ensure timely screening, and provide support mech- anisms for patients to facilitate their preventive screening decisions (Institute of Medicine Committee on Quality of Health Care in  0003-6870/$ e see front matter √ì 2013 Elsevier Ltd and The Ergonomics Society.

Conceptual  framework guiding the study (adapted from the Technology Acceptance Model) (Davis, 1989; Davis et al., 1989).  America, 2001). Personal Health Records (PHR) are an HIT that can play a signiÔ¨Åcant role in improving patients‚Äô knowledge of and attitudes toward their health care (Powsner, 1998; Brennan, 2000). The Markle Foundation (2003) deÔ¨Ånes PHR as ‚Äúan electronic application through which individuals can access, manage and share their health information in a private, secure, and conÔ¨Ådential environment.‚Äù International Standards Organization (ISO) (2009) indicated: ‚ÄúThe Personal Health Record of an individual is a re- pository of information considered by that individual to be relevant to his or her health, wellness, development and welfare, and for which that individual has primary control over the record‚Äôs content.‚Äù PHR can improve health care, including preventive care, through educating and engaging patients in their own health care (Krist and Woolf, 2011; Tang et al., 2006), and as a result transforming them into ‚Äòmore activated patients‚Äô (Von Korff et al., 1998; Lorig et al., 1996). Patient activation aims to help patients develop the skills, knowledge and motivation to become an effective participant in their health (Hibbard et al., 2004, 2005). It has been linked to better health outcomes and lower costs (Bodenheimer et al., 2002; Britto and Wimberg, 2009). PHR can increase patient activation (Eriksen and Ursin, 2004; Goth, 2008; Ueckert et al., 2003) and improve communication between patients and caregivers (Ueckert et al., 2003) (Eriksen and Ursin, 2004; Steele and Lo, 2009). These studies make it clear that patients are more likely to make good decisions and take actions to promote their health if they become active participants of their own health care (Bourgeois et al., 2008; Ueckert et al., 2003). In the early stages of health information systems, PHR-like systems were not always Web-based (Tang et al., 2006; Srinivasan, 2006). While there are still various platforms support- ing PHR systems, including free-standing/PC-based, universal serial bus (USB)/portable storage-based, and mobile/smart phone-based platforms, Web-based systems have so far shown their domi- nancy (Steele and Lo, 2009). Unlike Web-based health portals, which in most cases consist of a collection of standard information on health issues and illnesses and user-created discussion boards (Weingart et al., 2006). PHR systems typically allow users to manipulate their own health information, and therefore have the potential to better satisfy their health information needs and positively impact health behaviors (Malamateniou and Vassilacopoulos, 2010). PHR can motivate patients to take the rec- ommended preventive screening tests and to improve compliance with drug and other therapies by providing them with either tailored recommendations and education or electronic reminder mechanisms (Palen and Aalokke, 2006; Krist et al., 2011). These recommendations and reminders can lead to more informed pa- tientecaregiver interactions and cost savings. PHR can help family members manage the health information of speciÔ¨Åc groups such as  as  well  children, elderly, or terminally disabled patients (Greenhalgh et al., 2010; Bourgeois et al., 2008). PHR systems can also improve quality of health care by sup- porting care providers‚Äô work. For example, they can help in closing the health information gap between patients and providers by making the ‚Äúepisodic‚Äù nature of care more continuous (Ball et al., 2006) as well as facilitate patient education and shared decision- making. Although PHR have great potential to improve health care (Tang and Lansky, 2005; Scherger, 2005), in particular preventive care (Kahn et al., 2009; Krist et al., 2011), to date there is limited evi- dence supporting a positive impact of PHR on health care from patients‚Äô as well as caregivers‚Äô perspectives (Tang et al., 2006; Zuckerman and Kim, 2009). A small number of studies identiÔ¨Åed barriers to acceptance and widespread usage concerns about pri- vacy, security and conÔ¨Ådentiality of health-related data, feasibility of integration of PHR to electronic health records (EHR), accuracy and completeness of data entered, and usability and usefulness of PHR systems (Denton, 2001; Liu et al., 2011; Tang et al., 2006; Hargreaves, 2010). For PHR to gain widespread use, it needs to be accepted and adopted by both patients and care providers, as similar technology acceptance and adoption issues were reported in other areas (Venkatesh and Davis, 2000). It is therefore impor- tant to study factors that may potentially affect PHR acceptance from both the patients‚Äô and care providers‚Äô viewpoints. This will guide us on how to design and implement PHR that will meet the needs of both stakeholders, and will increase the likelihood of success. There is a knowledge gap in the literature regarding patient and care provider perceptions, attitudes and preferences toward any type of HIT (Angst and Agarwal, 2009), in particular PHR (Baird et al., 2011). A number of studies focused on usability and useful- ness issues from both patient and provider perspectives (Montague, 2010; Martin et al., 2011), but they focused on medical device design, rather than HIT. Furthermore, previous studies evaluated PHR from either patients‚Äô (direct users of PHR) or pro- viders‚Äô (indirect users) perspective, which is only part of the pic- ture. More work is needed to understand the use of PHR systems as a tool that can complement the traditional care, as well as their impact on patients, providers, organizations and health care sys- tems based on human factors and ergonomics concepts and methods (Nazi et al., 2009). Based on the above factors and the well-known Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) (Davis, 1989; Davis et al., 1989), we argue that high-usability and usefulness of patient-centric HIT can be valuable in improving patients‚Äô compliance with the recommended guidelines and medical outcomes. Fig. 1 presents the overarching conceptual framework guiding our study, which was adapted from the TAM. The framework indicates that a patient‚Äôs or care provider‚Äôs  
A. Ant Ozok et al.  / Applied Ergonomics 45 (2014) 613e628  615  attitude toward the PHR system can be determined by two con- structs: perceived usefulness and perceived usability. Instead of the construct ‚Äúperceived ease of use‚Äù included in the original TAM model, the modiÔ¨Åed framework uses the construct of ‚Äúperceived usability.‚Äù Due to the broader range of the usability term that in- cludes ease of use as well as a number of other concepts (Nielsen, 1993), perceived usability was chosen as one of the main con- structs. Nielsen (1993) deÔ¨Ånes a high-usability interface as an interface with high learnability, efÔ¨Åciency, memorability and satisfaction, and one with a low number of errors. In the context of this study, perceived usability refers to the ‚Äúdegree to which using this particular PHR system will be free of effort.‚Äù We deÔ¨Åne  perceived usefulness as ‚Äúthe degree to which a patient or provider believes that using the PHR would increase compliance with preven- tive screening and lifestyle changes.‚Äù The  conceptual framework postulates that if patients and providers have a more positive attitude toward the technologies they use (in terms of usefulness and usability), their acceptance, intention to use, and eventually their actual use of these technologies will also be higher. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the value (i.e., use- fulness and usability) of a speciÔ¨Åc patient-centered information technology in improving awareness of (for patients) and compli- ance with (for both patients and care providers) preventive care guidelines. Using a case study, we speciÔ¨Åcally aimed at determining patients‚Äô and providers‚Äô perceptions regarding (1) whether a PHR system can be useful in improving patientecare provider in- teractions, preventive health screening, and compliance with healthier lifestyle behaviors; and (2) the key usability factors of such a system. For the speciÔ¨Åc technology, we used a Web-based, secure system, MySafe-T.Net, developed as a PHR with the pri- mary aims of (1) improving preventive care and preventive screening rates and (2) changing patients‚Äô lifestyles to improve their health. MySafe-T.Net‚Äôs secondary aim is to serve as a health information repository. Making the technology useful and easy to use for both patients and care providers is a challenging goal, yet not exclusive to PHR systems. Health care is Ô¨Ålled with situations in which there are different types of users for the same technology (Carayon et al., 2010). Care is often provided in complex socio-technical environ- ments (Buckle et al., 2006; Carayon, 2010). Hence, (re)designing technologies based on human factors engineering, speciÔ¨Åcally us- ability and usefulness, principles by taking into account the over- lapping, complementary, and sometimes conÔ¨Çicting needs of multiple players is crucial if we want to improve overall systems performance.  2. Methodology  2.1. Description of  the MySafe-T.net system  MySafe-T.net was designed with the goal of preventing future health conditions such as high blood pressure, obesity and cancer and leading people to live a healthy life style by increasing patient activation. MySafe-T.net is aimed at increasing patients‚Äô compliance with preventive screening tests (e.g., colorectal cancer screenings, cholesterol screenings) and lifestyle changes (e.g., physical exercise, eating habits) recommended by the US Preventive Services Task Force based on an individual‚Äôs proÔ¨Åle including demographics, personal and family health histories, lifestyle and health habits (Shea et al., 1996). It can be used by people of various ages and clinical conditions, including healthy users. The system provides patients with an interactive environment to access their own health records via a Web browser. During the initial use, the system asks each patient to provide information on Ô¨Åve main categories including demographics, personal health history, family history,  lifestyle, and health habits (Appendices A1, A2 and A3). It develops an individual proÔ¨Åle based on this information, and then applies the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (2007) preventive health screening recommendations to this proÔ¨Åle to produce prevention and lifestyle change (e.g., frequency and intensity of physical ex- ercise) recommendations tailored to each person based on their individual risk factors (Appendix A4). MySafe-T.net also provides individualized educational Web site links (Appendix A5) based on each patient‚Äôs proÔ¨Åle. The recommendations are updated when the patient makes changes on their stored proÔ¨Åle. Using the system, the patient can print a ‚Äúletter for the care provider‚Äù and share this letter with their physician and other care providers. This letter includes information about the patient‚Äôs de- mographics, own and family health histories, and the recom- mended preventive screening tests and lifestyle changes based on their proÔ¨Åle. This feature was designed with the goal of improving the communication between patients and care providers and increasing shared decision-making.  2.2.  Study site and sample  The study was conducted at a Minnesota suburban primary care clinic afÔ¨Åliated with a nation-wide institution. We collected data from both patients and care providers. The clinic coordinator con- tacted 36 consecutive patients who had made an appointment at the clinic for an annual physical exam within a two-week window in February 2008, described the study brieÔ¨Çy and gave the contact information of the research assistant (MG) to those interested. Twenty-nine patients contacted the research assistant, who pro- vided detailed information about the study and checked each pa- tient‚Äôs eligibility for participation. The inclusion criteria included having scheduled an annual physical exam at the time of the study, having a moderate level of experience with computers and the Internet, and being 21 years of age or older. Of the 24 eligible pa- tients, 22 agreed to participate. Two patients declined due to scheduling issues. The assistant obtained consent from these pa- tients on the phone and instructed them to arrive at the clinic 2 h before their scheduled appointment. Each participant was paid $70 as an incentive at the end of their visit. Sixteen out of the 22 recruited patients participated in the follow-up phone interview within two weeks after their clinic appointment. All study pro- cedures were approved by the Institutional Review Boards of the involved institutions. We also recruited eight care providers (four out of six primary care physicians and four out of Ô¨Åve medical assistants) employed in the same clinic. Physicians were included in the study due to their important roles in providing preventive care including recom- mending, ordering and interpreting the results of preventive care screening, providing lifestyle change recommendations, and pre- scribing medications to patients. Medical assistants almost always interact with the patients before the physicians on the day of the annual physical exam, take medical histories including those related to preventive care, record vital signs, prepare patients for examinations, and convey information important for the exam to physicians. The information included in the PHR overlaps signiÔ¨Å- cantly with the information physicians and medical assistants need from patients during the annual physical exam.  2.3.  Study procedures  We used a multi-method approach (Johnson et al., 2007) for answering the research questions. We collected data via observa- tions, concurrent think-aloud method, two types of patient in- terviews (one immediately after the tasks and one follow-up within 2 weeks of the annual exam), a patient survey, and two

Table 1 summarizes the data collection methods along with their respective completion times, participant types (patients or care providers) and research questions addressed.  2.3.1. Data collection from patients  The assistant Ô¨Årst introduced herself and escorted the patient to a room with computer and Internet access where she provided information and instructions about the study. The patient was asked to complete eight tasks detailed in Table 2 (sample screen shots in Appendix A) and was instructed to ‚Äúthink-aloud‚Äù while she/he was completing the tasks, known as the concurrent think- aloud method (Van den Haak et al., 2003). This method allowed us to examine in more depth the perceived usefulness and usability issues concerning the system. After the patient completed entering the required information to develop the personal proÔ¨Åle (de- mographics, personal and family health history, medications and recent screenings), the system provided tailored preventive screening and lifestyle change recommendations. The patient was then asked to review these recommendations and visit at least three Web sites recommended by the system. It also automatically printed the ‚Äúletter for the care provider‚Äù which the assistant asked them to share with their medical assistant and the primary care physician at the beginning of their examination. During the experimentation, the research assistant observed participants‚Äô in- teractions with the system and took notes on automation surprises, confusion over instructions, overlooked site functions, and other potential problems. Next, patients were asked to complete a writ- ten survey and participate in an interview. They were then informed that they could login and use MySafe-T.net any time within the next two weeks to update their information, review the recommendations, or receive new recommendations. The experi- mentation took about 1 h to complete. A follow-up phone interview was conducted around the two-week mark.  2.3.2.  The Personal Health Records Survey (PHRS)  In order to determine the overall user perceptions concerning the usability and usefulness of the system and to complement the Ô¨Åndings from the qualitative studies, we conducted a survey among the patients. The Personal Health Records Survey (PHRS) is a paper-  Table 2 List of the experimental tasks and the instructions and additional  information given to users.  Tasks  Users were instructed to:  Users were informed that:  Task 1: Entering Demographic Information  - Enter demographic information - Save their information and move to the next task  Task 2: Entering Personal Health History  Task 3: Entering Lifestyle and Health Habits  Task 4: Entering Family History  Task 5: Viewing One‚Äôs ProÔ¨Åle Summary  Task 6: Viewing Recommendations  - Enter medication allergies and intolerances using the corresponding Edit buttons and drop-down menus - Enter past and current medical information - Enter their prior surgical history (surgery type and date) - Enter prior screening tests - Save and move to next task - Answer a number of questions for the system - Classify their habits into one or more of the ‚Äúhealth habits‚Äù categories  - Enter information regarding the medical history of family members (acute and chronic illnesses, surgeries) - Read their summary and make any modiÔ¨Åcations by going back to the corresponding section - Read health recommendations produced by the system based on their previous entries and through the use of some algorithms developed based on the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) guidelines  Task 7: Printing the Letter for the Care Provider  Task 8: Clicking on the Resources Link  - Keep the printed letter and hand it to the medical assistant and the physician at the beginning of their examination - Click on and review at least three of the external Web page links recommended by the system based on patient‚Äôs proÔ¨Åle  - They can always modify their demographic information later on by clicking on the Demographics button from the main menu - They can return to the main menu using the Back button - They can repeat each procedure until they enter all of their information  - Health habits categories include smoking, alcohol use, exercise and diet. Patient information on the habits is used by the system to generate lifestyle recommendations - They can also add information about their distant family members‚Äô (e.g., uncles and aunts)  -  - Recommendations are tailored based on the information patients provided For example, if a patient provided high cholesterol values, speciÔ¨Åc courses of action for lowering cholesterol would be recommended in this section based on age, lifestyle and habits, medical history, family history and the USPSTF guidelines - The letter provides a summary of key clinical information for each patient and preventive health screenings recommended for each patient - Patients can get additional information about a particular health screening and/or lifestyle change recommendation through these links.

It measures eight major constructs presented in Table 3 with corresponding dimensions, used measures, number of items, and Cronbach‚Äôs Alpha values. Thirty-eight of the 51 survey items had seven-point Likert scales as response categories ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree). Two items (on mental demand and effort) had 10-point scales (Low to High), and the rest consisted of demographic questions. The items that measured usability were in part based on the framework developed by Lin et al. (1997), and the perceived usefulness measures were based on the framework by Davis (1989) and Davis et al. (1989).  2.3.3. Patient interviews 2.3.3.1. Face-to-face patient  interviews  in the clinic.  Following the survey, patients were asked to participate in a short semi- structured interview conducted by the research assistant. The interview guide (Appendix B) was developed based on the con- ceptual framework guiding the study (Fig. 1, Davis, 1989; Davis et al., 1989; Lin et al., 1997). The goal of the interview was to pur- sue a one-on-one interaction with each patient to get more in- depth information (compared to the survey) about the positive and negative perceptions of usefulness and usability of the MySafe- T.net and the underlying factors for these perceptions. The usability questions were based on Nielsen (1993) and Shneiderman (1992) and Lin et al. (1997), and the usefulness questions, including ease of use and mental demand, were based on Davis‚Äôs (1989) frame- work on perceived usefulness. All interviews were digitally recor- ded and transcribed.  phone  2.3.3.2.  patient  Follow-up  interviews. A follow-up  phone interview with each patient was conducted about two weeks after the experiment. Sixteen of the 22 initial participants agreed to participate in the phone interview; 3 could not be reached after 4 attempts to contact via phone, and the rest declined to attend due to their busy schedules. During this interview, the research assis- tant inquired about (1) whether the patient used the system since their physician‚Äôs visit and why or why not; (2) how the physician  and the medical assistant reacted to the ‚Äúletter for the care pro- vider; ‚Äù and (3) whether they found the system useful and usable/ easy to use in the long-term and why or why not. The assistant took detailed notes during the interview.  2.3.4. Data collection from care providers  We conducted two focus groups with care providers after completing data collection from the patients, one with primary care physicians and one with medical assistants. All recruited care providers provided care to one or more patients who participated in the study, which allowed them to examine the ‚Äúletter for the care provider‚Äù that the patients shared with them as part of the study (at least twice) before participating in the focus groups. The focus group technique was used to allow moderated interactions be- tween care providers and to give providers an opportunity to enhance each other‚Äôs ideas and opinions concerning the system. Both focus groups were moderated by a human factors engineering expert (APG). The care providers did not use MySafe-T.net in practice. However, conducting the focus groups after the patient experiments ensured that providers had seen the ‚Äúletter for the care provider‚Äù for at least two patients. They were also provided with a detailed demonstration of the system at the beginning of the focus group by the moderator. The moderator asked questions us- ing the focus group guide in Appendix C. The sessions were recorded using a digital voice recorder and transcribed. Each ses- sion took under 1 h to complete.  2.3.5. Data analysis  2.3.5.1. Quantitative analysis. We limited our quantitative analysis to descriptive statistics due to the limited sample size as well as the supporting nature of the quantitative data. After data from the surveys were manually entered, standard data checking and veri- Ô¨Åcation were performed, and descriptive statistics including means and standard deviations were calculated.  2.3.5.2. Qualitative  analysis. To  viders‚Äô perceptions about  identify patients‚Äô and care pro- the value of MySafe-T.net, we analyzed

We used qualitative, directed content analysis using a deductive reasoning approach supplemented by inductive reasoning (Hsieh and Shannon, 2005). The overall analysis was guided by the conceptual framework in Fig. 1 (deductive approach). The top level categories in the coding structure were ‚Äúperceived usefulness‚Äù and ‚Äúperceived usability.‚Äù Although we started our data analysis with these two major categories, we allowed any addi- tional ‚Äútop-level‚Äù categories as well as sub-categories under each major category to emerge from the data (inductive approach). The coding structure was developed by two human factors engineers (AAO, APG) using a consensus approach. The combined deductive and inductive approaches ensured that we stayed focused on the research questions of interest (perceived usefulness and usability of PHR in improving compliance with preventive screening and life style changes), while it allowed us to identify speciÔ¨Åc characteris- tics of this type of PHR systems important for user acceptance based on the data (Hsieh and Shannon, 2005; Patton, 2002). Once the classiÔ¨Åcation scheme was developed, the data were coded by one author (AAO) and then reviewed independently by the other author (APG).  Table 5 Participating care provider demographics.

Proposed design characteristics. Based on the results ob-  tained, all authors convened and developed proposed PHR design characteristics.  3. Results  3.1.  Participant demographics  The patient sample was gender-balanced (50e50) and mostly in good or very good health (Table 4). The majority of the participating patients accessed the Web on a regular basis, mostly from their homes, with half of them accessing it more than 3 h per week. Table 5 provides demographic information concerning the care providers.  3.2. Descriptive statistics on elements of PHRS  Table 6 presents the descriptive statistics for all items in the PHRS, except demographics questions, which are presented in Table 4. The internal reliability of the survey was measured through three pairs of duplicate questions. The Cronbach‚Äôs Alpha values for these pairs were 0.90, 0.93, and 0.81, which were acceptable (Cronbach, 1990). Additionally, Cronbach‚Äôs Alpha values were calculated for each of the seven survey sections (Table 3). The co- efÔ¨Åcients were high, with four constructs having a value higher than 0.90, and only one construct being slightly below 0.80 (Section E), providing evidence for adequate reliability (Cronbach, 1990). The highest scores from each section are discussed next in descending order. Patient perceptions regarding the usefulness of the system (Section A) were mostly positive, with all seven questions scoring higher than 4.9 on a 7-point Likert scale (1 representing ‚Äústrongly disagree‚Äù and 7 representing ‚Äústrongly agree‚Äù). Patients indicated that care providers could keep a better eye on their health (Item 4) with the help of MySafe-T.net. They found the ‚ÄúResources‚Äù page (Item 7) and the system overall useful (Item 5), as well as the in- formation on the system relevant (Item 1). Patients‚Äô perceptions concerning the usefulness of the ‚ÄúRecommendations‚Äù page (Item 6) and usefulness of the recommendations provided by the system (Item 2) were also rated highly. Patients also gave high marks to the perceived security and trustworthiness of the site (Section B), as the conÔ¨Ådence in entering conÔ¨Ådential information, the perceived

Section C focused on the perceived impact of the system on personal health management. Patients welcomed the potential help offered by the MySafe-T.net in enabling them to be more in charge of their own health (Item 16) and in having more informa- tive conversations with their physicians (Item 12). They felt more informed regarding health risks due to family heritage through MySafe-T.net (Item 15). Their interest in collecting information from the system before their next physician‚Äôs visit and the MySafe- T.net‚Äôs helpfulness in better complying with the recommended preventive health screenings received more moderate scores (Items 11 and 13). Participants indicated the system helped them have a better understanding of the consequences of not following a healthy life style (Item 19). While still positive, scores were lower regarding the system‚Äôs helpfulness in starting and maintaining life style changes (Item 14) and whether the system gave them a better understanding of the consequences of not getting timely screenings (Item 18). Results indicated the positive informational and educa- tional characteristics of the system while scores concerning sharing of this information and making it a more integral part in their in- teractions were lower. Patients were less willing to make radical changes in their lifestyles based on what they learned from MySafe- T.net (Item 14). Section D included three questions that were du- plicates of previous questions for calculating the Cronbach‚Äôs Alpha coefÔ¨Åcients (Table 3). As part of Section E, patients found the system easy to use (Item 23) and the screens well-designed (Item 26). They had no difÔ¨Åculty understanding MySafe-T.net‚Äôs content (Item 29) and found the designs consistent (Item 32). Overall, perceived user performance and satisfaction levels with the system were very high. The ma- jority of the patients found screen instructions understandable (Item 30), screens well-designed (Item 27), and the PHR interesting (Item 28) and fast to work on (Item 31). Participants mostly did not think they made a lot of mistakes (Item 24) and there were too many task steps (Item 25). No signiÔ¨Åcant usability problems for MySafe-T.net were detected. Participants‚Äô overall satisfaction with the system (Item 36) was fairly high (about 82% of perfect score).

Qualitative analysis results  3.3.1.  Patients‚Äô views on the MySafe-T.net system  Positive patient perceptions regarding the system were cate- gorized as information tailored to individual patients, continuity of care, patient activation and improved communication with care providers. Negative perceptions and improvement suggestions included use of medical terminology that cannot be understood by lay people easily, need for more tailored and individualized infor- mation, and difÔ¨Åculty in remembering personal and family medical histories. Details are presented below.  3.3.1.1. Positive perceptions 3.3.1.1.1. Information tailored to individual patients. During the  interviews, 8 patients reported that they found the ‚Äútailored‚Äù and ‚Äúinformative‚Äù nature of the system based on medical and family history helpful and informative-more informative than generic sites-as evidenced by the following quote.  ‚ÄúI like this system because when you put in all your information, then it takes you to speciÔ¨Åc Web sites that pertain to your issues or disorders. It is more informative than other systems I have seen because it is more personal.‚Äù (Patient #4)  3.3.1.1.2.  Continuity of care.  Five patients indicated that MySafe- T.net has the potential to improve patient safety by giving them more control over their own health information and by functioning as a reliable repository of preventive health-related information. They can use the information in MySafe-T.net as they move across different care systems and care providers, which can result in more reliable and timely information transfer over the continuum of care. Patients found it useful that the system can alert their physicians of possible medicine interactions, prevent duplicate entries, and provide another medium for communication with their care providers.  3.3.1.1.3. Patient activation and improved communication with care providers. Based  on the information they learned from MySafe-T.net, ten patients indicated they have additional questions for their primary care physicians regarding some tests, and the system allowed them to easily remember these questions. The  system is ‚Äúa nice place to start the doctor‚Äôs visit on‚Äù (Participant #9).  
620  A. Ant Ozok et al.  / Applied Ergonomics 45 (2014) 613e628  It made communication with care providers easier, particularly due to the tailored recommendations and patient education provided, as exempliÔ¨Åed by the following quote.  ‚ÄúI should have a certain test done in Ô¨Åve years, but this system told me, because of my family history, that three years would probably be more appropriate for me. I want to talk to my doctor about this.‚Äù (Patient #17)  Other positive items identiÔ¨Åed by the patients included MySafe- T.net (1) focusing on key information, ‚Äúnuts and bolts,‚Äù avoiding unnecessary details; (2) acting as a reminder for things they should do such as eating better and exercising; (3) being useful because it allows them to track their health record and see possible health dangers; (4) being easy to use and self-explanatory.  3.3.1.2. Negative perceptions and improvement suggestions 3.3.1.2.1. More tailored and individualized information.  Three patients indicated the system could provide more speciÔ¨Åc information tailored to patients‚Äô conditions. For example, two pa- tients had multiple results for a speciÔ¨Åc test and the system allowed them to enter only one value:  ‚Äú[.] when I was in the preventive health screening test section, I was only able to enter the results of my most recent choles- terol.[.] However, my cholesterol was higher couple years ago but the system did not allow me to enter this information.‚Äù (Patient #14)  3.3.1.2.2. Use of medical  terminology. While generally patients indicated the system was easy to use, three patients reported not understanding one or more of the terms used in the MySafe-T.net. For example, one patient did not understand the term ‚Äútubal liga- tion‚Äù when completing her medical history, while another had a hard time with the instructions for entering her medication infor- mation. Also, one patient indicated:  ‚ÄúI know I am allergic to eye polytron hydroxy, but I did not know which category classiÔ¨Åed that.‚Äù  (Patient #8).  3.3.1.2.3.  Remembering  personal  and  family medical  history.  Two patients had some difÔ¨Åculty remembering their own and family medical histories in enough detail to enter into the system:  ‚ÄúThe matter is trying to remember what your background is, what your family‚Äôs background is. [.] It is a good tool as far as [.] things you probably should know about and you can always add them in later.‚Äù (Patient #20)  Overall, interviews indicated that MySafe-T.net was perceived by patients as a useful and easy to use system. To improve the acceptance of such a system, emphasis should be given to providing tailored information and recommendations to patients, and using a language that can easily be understood by laypeople.  3.3.2. Prospects for long-term use by patients based on follow-up interviews at the two-week mark  Of the 16 participants who agreed to participate in the follow-up phone interview, nine indicated that they used the system in the two weeks since their physical exam. All nine used it to access in- formation and resources, and two used it to update their proÔ¨Åles and review the recommendations based on their updated proÔ¨Åles. In the interview, participants were presented six statements and were asked to rate their agreement with those statements on a 7- point Likert scale. Participants moderately agreed that using the system allowed them to have a more informative conversation with their physicians (Mean ¬º 4.1.4, Std. Dev. ¬º 1.88). Three participants indicated that the physician and/or the medical assistant found the printout potentially useful, with one  medical assistant indicating it would make ‚Äúthings easier.‚Äù Four patients indicated they found the output useful during their conversations. One patient and one physician indicated the pre- ventive screening information was useful, and two indicated the doctors became quite interested in how the printout was pro- duced and asked for more information. One physician read directly from the care provider letter and discussed each item with the patient. One patient became interested in the electronic na- ture of the system and started using the clinic‚Äôs own electronic charting system after their experience with MySafe-T.net. One indicated MySafe-T.net should send optional monthly reminder e- mail alerts for reÔ¨Ålling their medications, updating their infor- mation, and going to their upcoming laboratory tests and doctor‚Äôs appointments. There were few negative comments from patients in the follow- up interviews. One patient found the system ‚Äúirrelevant‚Äù to their health, one indicated the system was not accurate in its recom- mendations, and two indicated they were ‚Äútoo young‚Äù or ‚Äútoo healthy‚Äù to use it. Another one indicated that it could be useful if it could be shared between different hospitals. In spite of these few negative comments, all but three patients who participated in the follow-up interviews stated they would be willing to use the sys- tem on a regular basis.  3.3.3.  Care providers‚Äô views on the MySafe-T.net system  Overall, both the participating primary care physicians and the medical assistants indicated that the system can improve quality and efÔ¨Åciency in primary care clinics. Physicians found several functions of the system useful, including medical histories of pa- tients and their families, tailored preventive screening recom- mendations, and medical education provided to patients, as evidenced by the following statement:  ‚ÄúI think that the history part they enter is nice to have. I can see someone I didn‚Äôt know walking in with one of these [letter for the care provider], that would be really helpful.‚Äù (Physician #3)  Both the physicians and medical assistants found the ‚Äúletter for the care provider‚Äù helpful as it provided preventive care screening recommendations based on each patient‚Äôs condition. Two physi- cians noted that patients who used the system had more detailed questions during the examination. Other positive points included the time-saving aspect of the system, the system being a ‚Äúhealth motivator‚Äù in both motivating patients to learn more about their health and to keep a healthy lifestyle, and being a ‚Äúlimited but good technology aid.‚Äù (Physician #3)  ‚ÄúFinally something to save me time. [.] I don‚Äôt have to explain them everything, I mean everything, [.] with this.‚Äù (Physician #2)  ‚ÄúMaybe they can go look up [the Internet] to help them get informed and be healthy, good health motivator.‚Äù (Physician #3)  Regarding how to further improve MySafe-T.net, they recom- mended including both generic and brand-name medications for patients to enter, have pop-up boxes providing more information on conditions, tests and medical terms, and automatically link to some information on best practices for better patient education. One physician indicated the system should connect to EMR (elec- tronic medical records) ‚Äúautomatically‚Äù and ‚Äúbi-directionally.‚Äù One physician wanted to see the exact screening dates appearing in this kind of EMR-integrated system.  ‚ÄúIt would be nice if they could . [be] potentially integrated with any EMR. So, for both directions, the patient could still maintain their own record . when they go from place to place.‚Äù (Physi- cian #2)

One negative comment included the system being ‚Äúnot for everyone and difÔ¨Åcult.‚Äù (Physician #1) Table 7 summarizes our recommendations regarding both the structural and content-related PHR design characteristics based on this study, along with the information on which part of the study those recommendations were deduced from.  3.3.4.  Proposed design characteristics  Table 8 presents a set of proposed design characteristics as a result of our analyses of the qualitative and quantitative data ob- tained from patients and care providers. It should be noted that the characteristics on Table 8 are not the result of rigorous testing, as our study primarily aimed at understanding the usability and usefulness issues of a PHR system based on a speciÔ¨Åc case study. However, the data we collected allowed us to provide some insight on the design features that are desired by patients and care pro- viders, based on their needs, limitations and motivations. The recommendations mostly focus on practical issues such as personalized structure, Ô¨Çexibility in the number of patient entries and interoperability with other systems, as well as possible future expansions of the system, such as creating push notiÔ¨Åcations (in the form of e-mails and other tools), and syncing with the patients‚Äô electronic medical records. The proposed design features can be used as a starting point to develop PHR design guidelines produced from patient and caregiver perspectives.  4. Discussion  We examined a particular Web-based PHR system for critical factors concerning perceived usefulness and usability from both the patients‚Äô and providers‚Äô perspectives in a case study. User percep- tions regarding the usefulness of this PHR system were high, with users showing interest in keeping their health records online and using them to get educated on health care issues. Patients reported that they were more aware of the relevant preventive health screening tests and procedures after using the MySafe-T.net. They found the tailored recommendations for preventive screening and lifestyle changes helpful. Furthermore, both patients and care providers generally found MySafe-T.net a good reminder of health issues and a relevant information resource. Patients valued the information that motivates them to get screenings and tests on time, as well as having their health information recorded elec- tronically and be easily accessible. Patients also pointed out simplicity as a positive design factor. Furthermore, some patients indicated that the PHR system contributed to improved commu- nication with their health care providers, allowing them to have more effective conversations and ask targeted questions. In addi- tion, participating patients and care providers also expressed a relatively high level of trust in the system with keeping their pri- vate information secure and conÔ¨Ådential. Although patients found the system useful and usable, they also stated that they would feel uncomfortable relying solely on the system‚Äôs recommendations regarding their preventive health care. Patients‚Äô unwillingness to make important health care decisions based on the information they gathered from the site can be seen as one of the strengths of the system, as the aim of MySafe-T.net is not to replace but com- plement primary care visits. Patients should consult their physi- cians before making critical decisions related to their health care. Additionally, radical health behavior change is hard to achieve and in general requires multi-level interventions on multiple behaviors (Ory et al., 2002). The system is perceived as an informational tool rather than a tool offering guidelines on health behaviors and lifestyle choices. This view can guide researchers in developing better ways to present health information. In general, care providers found the system promising for improving preventive care. They indicated that having it as a pa- tient‚Äôs (incomplete) medical information resource is useful, and the system provided some information they otherwise did not know about the patients. They saw the ‚Äúletter for the care provider‚Äù as a ‚Äútime saver.‚Äù While patient Internet portals are relatively common (Weingart et al., 2006), the unique characteristics of this system included providing more tailored, evidence-based content and a higher level of interactivity. Overall, patients and care providers showed substantial interest in adopting MySafe-T.net on a perma- nent basis. The study also revealed several areas that can be focused on to improve the usability and usefulness of such a system. While pa- tients valued the information obtained from the system, they re- ported that the system would be more valuable with even more tailored information. Furthermore, several patients found some of the terminology confusing and unfamiliar, and did not like the system‚Äôs high reliance on one‚Äôs memory. These problems are difÔ¨Åcult to overcome. One potential solution is to integrate the system with the patients‚Äô medical records, which is known to be challenging from Ô¨Ånancial, legal and technological perspectives (Angst and Agarwal, 2009; Bourgeois et al., 2008; Baird et al., 2011). Although care providers found the ‚Äúletter for the care provider‚Äù helpful, some of them also indicated that this feature may be not suitable for every patient. Furthermore, care providers indicated that some pieces of important information was lacking in the sys- tem such as the information on generic medications. An ideal

Overall, using a multi-method approach and evaluating MySafe- T.net from both the direct and indirect users‚Äô perspectives provided valuable and in-depth information regarding the positive and negative design characteristics of such a system. A PHR system can be useful for both patients and care providers and used by patients on a regular basis as a reliable information resource and health education tool. This Ô¨Ånding is parallel to the Ô¨Åndings by Denton (2001) and Pratt et al. (2006) who indicated that a well- presented electronic environment can increase PHR use and motivate patients to manage their health information. The Ô¨Åndings support and build upon the health care literature by determining the role PHR can play in making patients more active participants in managing their own health. A usable and reliable Web-based sys- tem that presents relevant content on maintaining a healthy life- style, improving communication with caregivers, and emphasis on preventive health screening can be adopted by patients. The key for high adoption is to design a user-friendly and relevant system that can provide tailored and comprehensive, yet easy to understand recommendations to patients based on scientiÔ¨Åc evidence. We focused on preventive care due to the literature indicating that employing PHR may improve patient awareness of preventive care guidelines and compliance rates with the recommended preventive screening tests and other related measures. Human factors research shows that for a technology to positively affect compliance and performance, one of the Ô¨Årst requirements is for the technology to be accepted as useful and usable (Karsh et al., 2006; Krist and Woolf, 2011). A PHR that is perceived as useful and usable, in turn, may result in improved health outcomes (Kahn et al., 2009). In this study, however, we did not evaluate the impact of a PHR on patients‚Äô long-term behavior change (e.g., increased compliance with recommended diets, increased medication adherence) and outcome measures on improvements in preventive care (e.g., reduced morbidities). Future research should evaluate such impact. The methodological contribution of our study mainly lies in the multi-method approach and the patient-centric design of the experiment. The quantitative methodologies allowed us to deter- mine patients‚Äô views of a PHR system with a focus on preventive screening with regards to well-known constructs that affect tech- nology acceptance (for example, Denton, 2001), while the qualita- tive methodologies allowed us to determine patients‚Äô and caregivers‚Äô attitudes on the usefulness of a PHR system focused on  improving preventive care and suggestions on how such systems can be improved both content- and usability-wise in future designs. Additionally, there are a limited number of studies in the literature that evaluated patient-centric HIT so far using a human factors engineering approach. Our study was aimed at understanding the perceptions of usability and usefulness of PHR systems based on a speciÔ¨Åc system from both the patients‚Äô and caregivers‚Äô perspec- tives. Findings from this case study can help researchers in oper- ationalizing usefulness and usability in future PHR design and evaluation studies. Human factors research needs to take multiple users for the same technology/interface into consideration in many health care settings (Carayon et al., 2010), and qualitative (Gurses et al., 2009; Karsh et al., 2006) and quantitative (Miller et al., 2006) methodologies may need to be used together for investi- gating different user groups‚Äô perspectives on such systems. Experiences with many of the technologies introduced into health care, especially information technologies, have been medi- ocre at best (Karsh et al., 2010). Most of the health information technologies have been developed under the assumption of a linear and predictable nature of work in health care (Gurses et al., 2011). However, health care is, by its nature, team-based, non-linear, event-driven, complex, and full of deviations. Given the complex and safety-critical nature of health care, more systematic and science-based approaches (Leveson, 2001) that build upon strong partnerships among product developers, human factors and us- ability engineers, clinicians, patients, and regulators are needed. With the move from paper to electronic record environments, this type of partnership is a must, not an option to improve quality and safety of health care.  4.1.  Limitations  This study had several limitations. First, we used a particular PHR as a case study, and our Ô¨Åndings may not be generalizable to other PHR systems. A wide variety of Web-based PHR systems are currently available that may vary in the features they offer. Our study focused on the usability and usefulness issues involving a speciÔ¨Åc PHR. Due to the fragmented nature of currently available PHR de- signs, we did not fully assess how similar MySafe-T.net‚Äôs features are to those currently available in other PHR systems. Our study also did not evaluate in-situ or long-term PHR usability or perceptions of usefulness. For assessing more general perceptions of health con- sumers regarding PHR systems, different methods (e.g., a large-scale  
A. Ant Ozok et al.  / Applied Ergonomics 45 (2014) 613e628  623  survey of health care consumers who have used PHRs) will need to be used with a larger sample size. Second, due to the exploratory nature of our study, we did not evaluate the PHR system after it has been used on a long-term basis by patients and care providers. Rather, participants indicated their opinions concerning the system after a structured examination of it (with a follow-up interview). It is possible that participants may have additional and/or different opinions after using the system on a long-term basis. Third, our sample size may be viewed as relatively small for collecting data via a questionnaire. However, we considered a sample size of 22 as adequate due to the exploratory nature of the study that focused on determining current general trends and at- titudes toward a PHR system aimed at improving preventive care. Additionally, we contacted thirty-six consecutive patients who called the clinic for an annual physical exam appointment, resulting in a fairly high response rate of 61%. The survey helped determine the potential usefulness and usability issues concerning the system, and complemented the data obtained through qualitative methods. It should be noted, however, that a higher number of participants that have a broader spectrum including different ailment severities and types, as well as different age and education levels, could have helped in identifying new design characteristics or reÔ¨Åning the existing ones for the Web-based PHR systems to make them appealing to a broader population. With this sample size, partici- pant diversity may not have been adequately captured to further generalize our Ô¨Åndings. Also, there is a body of work focusing on PHR adoption differences due to culture (Hartley, 2004; Fuji et al., 2008; Urowitz et al., 2008; Kahn et al., 2009). Our study did not consider the role of culture in PHR adoption. Additionally, while our case study was based on a PHR system focused on preventive health, we did not measure the impact of PHR on health outcomes. Finally, 16 out of the 22 patients invited participated in the follow- up interviews, and it is possible that those who did not participate in the follow-up may have different views about the system.  4.2.  Future work  While the PHR system was found useful, patients indicated they prefer an even more tailored system. The recommendations and resources are useful, but sometimes rely on external links. An agent-based approach, where intelligent programs would do searches for relevant information in similar patterns to humans (Luck and D‚ÄôInverno, 2001), may increase the accuracy of the rec- ommendations and resources, and the information the site pro- vides can be enhanced with more comprehensive databases that can be integrated into the system. Moreover, a future system can interface with the provider-based electronic health records of the patients and combine the two information sources. PHR systems may also expand to mobile environments, and the concept of technology acceptance may go through some changes while being adapted to health care environments (Holden and Karsh, 2010).

s000368701300183x,"  The evaluation of hand function is of importance in the assessment of upper limb impairments such as complaints of arm, neck and shoulder (CANS), chronic musculoskeletal pain or dis- abilities as the result of rheumatoid arthritis, chronic fatigue syn- drome, developmental disabilities, muscular dystrophy, chronic pain or stroke (Blair et al., 1987; Mitsionis et al., 2009). Due to the importance of hand force in relation to work-related musculo- skeletal disorders, evaluation of hand function and work ability has been a research issue among ergonomics researcher (Bao and Silverstein, 2005). Upper extremity work capacity testing can be a part of Func- tional Capacity Evaluations (FCEs).

FCEs can be job speciÔ¨Åc (Innes, 1999) or pathology speciÔ¨Åc (Reneman et al., 2005; Gross et al., 2006; Gouttebarge et al., 2010) and they can be used to determine hand function (Reneman et al., 2005; Soer et al., 2006). A pathology speciÔ¨Åc FCE protocol for patients with work related upper limb disorders, consists of tests which deter- mine Hand Grip strength, Ô¨Ånger strength and upper limb dexterity (Soer et al., 2006). Usually these tests consist of multiple repeated trials, but there is discussion about the efÔ¨Åciency and validity (Watanabe et al., 2005), because repeated trials are time consuming, expensive and results may be affected by (muscle) fa- tigue (Watanabe et al., 2005, Reddon et al., 1985) and/or learning (Watanabe et al., 2005). Reliable and validated FCE protocols that consist of fewer or single trials to assess hand function have not been described. Some authors argue that a more efÔ¨Åcient protocol can be developed since protocols that consists of less trials do not seem to affect the validity and reliability of the protocol (Soer et al., 2006; Coldham et al., 2006; Roberts et al., 2011).

Many exposures are difÔ¨Åcult to collect in the work environment; there- fore grip strength testing in combination with methods such as ‚Äúforce matching‚Äù is used by ergonomist in the Ô¨Åeld. (Bao and Silverstein, 2005; Dale et al., 2011; Wiktorin et al., 1996). It is also being argued that a measure of grip strength is not a true measure of grip strength alone because of the inÔ¨Çuence of pain and therefore a shorter protocol could lead to a more true measure of Hand Grip strength (Coldham et al., 2006). A less time consuming and demanding protocol could lead to reliable outcomes but that are less physical demanding, for workers with and without history of upper limb pathology (Coldham et al., 2006; Roberts et al., 2011). Therefore, a more efÔ¨Åcient FCE protocol which consists of fewer trials may also lead to a more valid and reliable evaluation of hand function. Shorter protocols are more beneÔ¨Åcial for ergonomists and occupational health specialists who determine hand function for work ability assessments, because it leads to a less time intensive and more cost efÔ¨Åcient procedure (Dale et al., 2011). The aim of this study was to develop a more effective, lean and valid protocol to assess hand function. It was hypothesized that a shorter protocol does not affect the validity of hand function capacity testing.  2. "
s0003687013001841,"  In the U.S., there are an estimated 12,000e20,000 new spinal cord injuries each year (Sekhon and Fehlings, 2001; Bernhard et al., 2005), with approximately 20% of deaths and 25% of cases exac- erbated prior to arrival at the hospital (Sekhon and Fehlings, 2001; Thurman et al., 1994; Bernhard et al., 2005). The estimated cost of spinal cord injuries exceeds $7 billion (DeVivo, 1997). It is apparent that pre-hospital transportation is a critical period for patients of both civilian and military medical teams, yet healthcare on the battleÔ¨Åeld presents some of the most dangerous and controversial methods of providing aid for combat casualties. Advancements in armor and current war tactics have changed the pattern of injury; current research has revealed that a larger proportion of head and neck injuries are emerging, with most due to an explosive mech- anism (Owens et al., 2008). Within this harsh environment, pre- hospital transportation has become a topic of growing interest in recent years. The phases of medical evacuation can be characterized by ground, vehicle, and aerial transport (Kang and Lehman, 2011), and whole-  * Corresponding author.

A study (Alberti et al., 2006) on off-road ambu- lance and hand transportation showed the largest un-weighted average accelerationsd1.87 and 1.46 m/s2, respectively. In addi- tion, helicopter and ambulance accelerations have been recorded in medical transportation (Silbergleit et al., 1991). Due to the lack of safety standards pertaining to supine vibration, whole-body vibra- tion exposure has been studied using International Organization for Standardization (ISO-2631-1) standards for hand transport, ground vehicle transport, and aerial methods relating to a mountain rescue operation, even though these standards apply to seated vibration. Huang and GrifÔ¨Ån (2008a) observed the apparent mass for the semi-supine human body during vertical and longitudinal dual- axis vibration, the apparent mass during longitudinal and hori- zontal vibration (Huang and GrifÔ¨Ån, 2008b), and the apparent mass and transmissibility during vertical vibration for the semi-supine, full supine, and constrained supine postures (Huang and GrifÔ¨Ån, 2009). SpeciÔ¨Åc to spinal immobilization, Perry et al. (1999) re- ported relative neck motions associated with horizontal vibration; the neck motion was deemed clinically signiÔ¨Åcant by a neurosci- entist for a potential contribution to spinal cord injury. In civilian applications, the use of a cervical collar is recommended during spinal immobilization (Shade et al., 2002; National Association of Emergency Medical Technicians (US), 2005).

In the supine position, the input energy enters the body from different locations (head, torso, pelvis, and legs), and while it looks like each segment is vibrating independently due to the input motion, it is also clear that the motion of each segment is affected by the motion of the neighboring segments. The relative transmissibility is introduced in this work to capture the effect of the input ground motion on the motion of the cervical spine (relative motion be- tween the head and sternum) and on the motion of the lower back (relative motion between the sternum and pelvis). The objective of the current work is to quantify the effect of a long spinal board strapped to a standard military litter and neck- collar conditions on the transmitted motion to the head, sternum, pelvis, cervical spine, and lower back during whole-body vibration. By understanding the supine human response under these condi- tions, future developments and designs may be incorporated to reduce the transmitted vibration to the supine patients during transportation.  2.

s0003687013001853,"  User-centered design of a process monitoring display is impor- tant for supporting proactive monitoring by console operators, which not only prevents critical mistakes, but also improves users‚Äô acceptance and satisfaction level (Quintana et al., 2012). Recently, a signiÔ¨Åcant challenge of the information age is overcoming the in- formation gap between data produced and information needed (Endsley, 2009). Advanced technology provides an almost unlim- ited ability to instantly process data while human‚Äôs abilities to simultaneously understand this data is limited. This problem is exacerbated when an operator has a very high workload. Console operators in oil and gas reÔ¨Åneries are a good example of workers that experience a high workload task. Most control room operators are responsible for continuously monitoring at least 200 control loops for long periods of time (Tharanathan et al., 2012). A high level of sensitivity for detecting a process parameter deviating outside of normal variation is necessary to safely manage a plant. For that reason, the Abnormal Situation Management Joint Research and Development Consortium (ASM Consortium)  * Corresponding author. Tel.: √æ1 8148657241. lrothroc@psu.edu, lxr28@psu.edu (L. Rothrock).  E-mail addresses:  initiated a Visual Thesaurus project to research and create a set of graphical objects that can support operator monitoring tasks. In 2006, the Visual Thesaurus research began by creating the set of graphical shapes (Peter Bullemer, 2009). In 2007, the research team focused on the effectiveness of the 2006 Visual Thesaurus objects to support proactive monitoring. To measure the accuracy of change detection, Geoffrey Ho and his research team used Signal Detection Theory (Geoffrey Ho, 2008). Based on this result, an illustrative Overview Display (OD) was designed for an actual coker process plant at one of the consortium members‚Äô reÔ¨Ånery sites (see Fig. 1). The limitation of 2007 Visual Thesaurus research was the team conducted an experiment based on the single-task environment. The experiment was held in a dark room, where the only source of light was the computer monitor. This is an unrealistic condition for console operators in oil and gas reÔ¨Ånery plants because they commonly perform other work activities while monitoring their process displays. There is a signiÔ¨Åcant difference between the single-task and the dual-tasks environment to detect process de- viation from normal range. According to Bundesen‚Äôs TVA (Theory of Visual Attention), visual search performance can be inÔ¨Çuenced by the strength of the visual stimuli as well as the perceptual decision bias (Bundesen, 1990). In the dual-task environment, the model of visual attention should include switching time between the dual- tasks for changing parameters compared to the single-task  0003-6870/$ e see front matter √ì 2013 Elsevier Ltd and The Ergonomics Society.

Illustrative overview display (Dal Vernon and Bullemer, 2008).  environment (Logan and Gordon, 2001) because the requirement to switch from one task to another task creates an emergent need to organize and schedule the elementary, subordinate processes (Allport et al., 1994). Hence, in the dual-task environment, opera- tors must quickly switch their attention from one task to the other in order to keep pace with performance for both tasks continuously (1972). In addition, the usage of channels of visual information (referred to as foveal and peripheral vision) in dual-tasks interfer- ence is different compared to single-task interference (Wickens, 2002). Human observers use foveal and peripheral vision based on the location of the subject (Thorpe et al., 2001). These visions are working together to produce the entire visual perception. Foveal vision is required in order to look at the subject with high acuity. Peripheral vision is the region outside a person‚Äôs gaze. Peripheral vision consists of parafoveal, mid-peripheral, and far peripheral vision (Rayner et al., 1981). For that reason, there is a signiÔ¨Åcant difference between the single-task and dual-task in most visual scanning environment. To create a more realistic testing environment using a dual-task assessment approach was developed to reÔ¨Çect the control room task environment to the participants (Tharanathan et al., 2010). Tharanathan and his colleagues used a Ô¨Çag-matching task for the additional task because this task demanded the use of similar cognitive resources as needed when performing typical console operations activities. The results showed that operators‚Äô situation awareness was signiÔ¨Åcantly higher when they monitored the pro- cess on the OD compared to a traditional display in the dual-task test environment (Tharanathan et al., 2010). However, they could not evaluate the effectiveness (e.g. sensitivity, operator‚Äôs bias, and operator‚Äôs response time) of change detection in different graphical gauge shapes. In order to supplement the limitations of these previous Visual Thesaurus research, we developed the Time  Window-based Human-In-The-Loop (TWHITL) simulation test bed and focused on evaluating the effectiveness of the abnormality detection in process changes at Ô¨Çow, level, pressure, and temper- ature shapes from Visual Thesaurus in the dual-task test environment. The purpose of this research effort is to investigate the impact of shapes and display density on the following:   detection effectiveness in terms of sensitivity (d‚Äô) and bias (b);  detection response times;  perceived workload; and  performance on the secondary task.  Process monitoring displays using qualitative shapes can become very dense when showing a large number of process parameters. Based on the rationale of the visual attention differ- ence between single-task and dual-task environment, the per- formance of both tasks might be signiÔ¨Åcantly inÔ¨Çuenced by the increment of the display density level of the primary monitoring task. In our experiment, display density was manipulated using different set sizes for the display. Set size refers to the number of shapes that were in the display. Time Window-based Human-In- The-Loop (TWHITL) simulation provided different levels of set size.  2. "
s0003687013001865,"  The head is one of the most vulnerable parts of the body. Therefore, head protection is recommended, and often mandatory, for many professional and leisure activities. A helmet‚Äôs main pur- pose is to protect against mechanical impact, e.g., for bicyclists, soldiers, and Ô¨ÅreÔ¨Åghters. Consequently, most scientiÔ¨Åc attention is spent on optimizing helmets to protect against mechanical impact (Aare et al., 2004; Cui et al., 2009; Deck and Willinger, 2006; Mills and Gilchrist, 2008). However, protective headgear is often asso- ciated with elevated local skin temperatures, unfavorable temper- ature perception, and discomfort (De Bruyne et al., 2008; Hsu et al., 2000; Li et al., 2008; Liu et al., 2008; Patel and Mohan, 1993; Skalkidou et al., 1999). This motivated several studies on the er- gonomics of helmets, mainly focused on ventilation (Abeysekera et al., 1991; Bogerd and Br√ºhwiler, 2009; Br√ºhwiler et al., 2006; Reischl, 1986; Van Brecht et al., 2008). These studies started to take our understanding beyond the simple mechanics of impact pro- tection to the wider issue of how a helmet affects its wearer. A helmet is typically worn in situations with a higher likelihood for an accident and/or larger consequences if an accident occurs.  * Corresponding author. Tel.: √æ31 888661893. E-mail address: niels.bogerd@tno.nl (C.P. Bogerd).  Therefore, any tendency for a helmet to distract or otherwise reduce the performance of its wearer is undesirable, and could potentially obviate its protective effect by making potentially injurious incidents more likely to occur. Hancock and Warm (1989) have suggested a relationship between attention performance and stress. The stress in their model can be psychological as well as physiological in nature. This model explains several studies showing negative effects of fabric discomfort (Bell et al., 2003, 2005) and whole-body thermal discomfort on cognitive perfor- mance (Gaoua et al., 2012). Since helmets cause disturbances to the wearer, and affect the temperature of the scalp‚Äôs surface, this raises the question whether a helmet might negatively affect cognitive performance. Four studies have evaluated the effect of passive headgear on cognitive performance. Three of these studies used the same helmet that covered the scalp and ears but left the face uncovered (Hancock, 1983; Hancock and Dirkin, 1982; Holt and Brainard, 1976). One of these studies found increased reaction times on a dual task while wearing the helmet (Hancock and Dirkin, 1982). A more recent study found a negative effect on cognitive performance of wearing a cricket helmet during cricket practice (Neave et al., 2004). In contrast to these two studies, which showed an effect of headgear, on at least one of the cognitive parameters investigated, the other two found no effect of helmet-wearing (Hancock, 1983; Holt and Brainard, 1976).

672  C.P. Bogerd et al.  / Applied Ergonomics 45 (2014) 671e676  (Fig. 1). A conventional keyboard and joystick (Attack 3, Logitech, Fremont, USA) were positioned in front of the screen. The vertical was 5 (1) cm, and the horizontal distance from the end of distance from the participant‚Äôs head to the top of the wind tunnel the to the forehead was 8 (6) cm. This housing of the wind tunnel resulted in a viewing distance of 53 (6) cm from the eyes of the participant to the screen. During the sessions the participant was the only person occupying the chamber and did not have contact with the outside, nor had he any reference to time. All measure- ments were conducted in a climate chamber maintained at an ambient temperature of 27.2 (0.6) C, and relative humidity of 41 (1)%. The wind speed (vw) was 0.5 (0.1) m s  1 in order to have a minimal, but well-controlled vw.  2.3.  Protocol  Each participant underwent Ô¨Åve sessions. The time of day was kept constant to avoid any inÔ¨Çuences of the circadian rhythm. In order to reduce learning effects on the results, participants carried out three familiarization sessions, this was found sufÔ¨Åcient for avoiding a learning effect in a pilot study (available on request). Subsequently, each participant underwent two experimental ses- sions in a balanced order. The Ô¨Årst and last sessions occurred within two weeks, in order to prevent loss of familiarization. Before the start of each session the participant completed a mood question- naire (Monk, 1989), and indicated the quality and quantity of their sleep during the previous two nights on two visual analogue scales. Finally, each session was Ô¨Ånished with the assessment of whole- ( 4: body temperature perception on a nine-point scale very cold, to 0: neutral, to 4: very hot) and a Ô¨Åve-point thermal comfort scale (0: comfortable, to  4: extremely uncomfortable). Both scales are detailed elsewhere (ISO10551, 2001). The Ô¨Årst 10 min of each experimental session were a familiar- ization session (Fig. 2). Each participant donned safety goggles (control: CON) or a helmet (intervention: HEL) at the start of this period and kept these on until the session was completed. More details concerning the helmets and goggles are given under Section 2.5. Following the familiarization, a 20 min equilibration phase started, the purpose of which was to achieve a thermal steady state. This period was previously found to be sufÔ¨Åcient for this purpose (Bogerd et al., 2011). During this phase the participant read or carried out unrelated computer work. Finally, each participant completed the cognitive test battery. The three separate familiar- ization sessions, preceding the experimental sessions, consisted of the Ô¨Årst 10 min of an experimental session, and did not take place on the same day as an experimental condition.  2.4.  Cognitive tests  The following three cognitive performance examinations were employed: i) a simultaneous visual vigilance and tracking test (VTT), ii) an auditory vigilance test (AVT), and iii) a letter cancel- lation test (LCT). We found the LCT to be sensitive to a motorcycle helmet intervention in pilot studies, and the VTT has been used in previous work (e.g. Van Dorp et al., 2007). The AVT was developed in a pilot study as a secondary load simultaneous to the VTT in an attempt to improve the sensitivity of the method, consistent with the idea of providing an attention capacity load high enough so that the stress caused by the intervention cannot be buffered, as dis- cussed in the . In what follows these tests are detailed.  Fig. 1. The setup with a participant carrying out the simultaneous visual vigilance and tracking test (VTT) and auditory vigilance test (AVT). The helmet shown here was not used in the study.  helmet has a minor effect of cognitive performance. In fact, the effect size (r2) calculated from these publications is 0.02 (0.02), which is small in magnitude (Cohen, 1988). The present study revisits the effect of a helmet on cognitive performance with a view to clarifying this contradictory literature. Since the effect of a helmet on cognitive performance is expected to be small, the present study aims at saturating the participants‚Äô attention capacity (Hancock and Warm, 1989), so that small effects cannot be buffered, and thus become more likely detectible. In addition, the thermal environment was chosen such that wearing a helmet would cause a substantially higher skin temperature as well as thermal discomfort compared to the no wearing a helmet. The helmet employed was of a full-face type, encapsulating the entire head, thereby causing a realistic by extreme condition. Finally, the study design was aimed at keeping the distraction/discomfort from the body constant and as close as possible to neutral, with the exception of the head as site of the intervention.  2. Materials and methods  2.1.  Participants  (4.7) Nineteen healthy male participants aged 28.3 years (mean  standard deviation) completed the study. The participants‚Äô head circumferences ranged from 53 cm to 62 cm. The exclusion criteria were the use of medications on a regular basis, or suffering from claustrophobia or an attention disorder. All participants were instructed to refrain from alcohol, drugs and caffeine 12 h prior to each session. During familiarization sessions the participants were instructed to adjust their clothing in order to be thermally comfortable. As a result the participants wore jeans in combination with a long sleeved shirt or a T-shirt. The participants wore the same clothing during both experimental sessions. All participants gave informed consent before participation. This study was approved by the Cantonal Ethics Committee of St. Gallen (Switzerland).  2.2.  Setup  the exit of a wind tunnel.

The ball received random impulses from the software, and the participant was instructed to keep it in the middle of the annulus, using the joystick to control the acceleration, direction, and amplitude. On the screen, the outer di- ameters of the annulus and ball were 4.3 cm and 2.6 cm, respec- tively. The vigilance component required continual observation of a black square in the center of the annulus which appeared to rotate 45 every 1 s. At random intervals the square was replaced by a black circle of similar size (diameter 1.1 cm); upon perceiving this change, the participant had to press the ‚ÄòÔ¨Åre‚Äô button of the joystick as soon as possible. A random number of 125 (14) such circles were pre- sented to the participant during a 30 min period. The following parameters were obtained from the VTT: (i) the mean absolute distance of the center of the ball to the center of the annulus, (ii) the mean reaction time to the appearance of the circular target, (iii) the number of correct detections of this target (deÔ¨Åned as a response within 2 s of its appearance), and (iv) the number of false alarms (responses when the target had not appeared).  2.4.2. Auditory vigilance test (AVT)  The AVT presented the participants with a random sequence of two tones (2.5 kHz or 2.0 kHz) at 0.8 s intervals. At a random point in each 20 s interval, a sequence of three the same tones was pre- sented. The participants were instructed to respond to these trip- lets as quickly as possible by pressing the spacebar on the keyboard. The following parameters were obtained: (i) reaction time, (ii) the number of correct responses (deÔ¨Åned as a response within 2 s of the triplet), and (iii) the number of false alarms (responses when the target had not appeared). The tones were presented via in-ear phones (CX300, Sennheiser Electronic, Wedemark, Germany) which occupied little space outside the ear, in order to minimize problems Ô¨Åtting the helmet. Each participant chose the volume with which the tones were presented during the Ô¨Årst familiariza- tion session, and this was then kept constant over the remaining sessions. The AVT software was written in Matlab R2006b with use of the Psychtoolbox, version 3.0.8 (Brainard, 1997).  2.4.3.  Letter cancellation test (LCT)  The letter cancellation test (LCT) consisted of six lines of 52 characters each, printed in 10 point Courier New type in landscape orientation over the full width of a white A4 page, with a 1 cm margin to the left and right of the text. Each line held nine ‚ÄòK‚Äô and nine ‚ÄòN‚Äô characters, randomly placed amongst other letters chosen at random. The task was to highlight all characters ‚ÄòK‚Äô and ‚ÄòN‚Äô using a marker, as quickly and accurately as possible. The time to completion and the number of correct responses were registered.  2.5.  Intervention  During one experimental session the participant wore a helmet, while the other session served as a control condition in which the  participant wore only goggles, as indicated in Fig. 2. In preparation for the Ô¨Årst familiarization session, the participant was presented with the helmet size (as indicated by the manufacturer) corre- sponding to his head circumference, which was measured accord- ing to ISO8559 (1989). In addition, the participants chose the most comfortable model out of three comparable full-face motorcycle helmet models. These helmets have previously been characterized for their effect on heat loss (Bogerd and Br√ºhwiler, 2008, 2009), in those two studies, these helmets were coded as 130, 201, and 250. The helmets facilitate a similar heat transfer under the present wind still conditions. Furthermore, if the participant judged a given helmet to be uncomfortably tight or loose, the next appropriate size was used. During the sessions, the visor and vents of the helmet remained closed. During CON, the participant wore clear standard safety goggles (Astrospec 3000, Uvex, F√ºrth, Germany), in order to match the visual conditions experienced when looking through a motorcycle visor. The visor and goggles were cleaned before each use.  2.6.  Statistics and data processing  The data collected during the 30 min VTT √æ AVT were evaluated as averages of six 5-min intervals for VTT and AVT. Repeated- measures multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) and gener- alized linear mixed models were employed for analyses as appro- priate (further details below). Perception of comfort and temperature were compared using a paired t-test. Initial data processing was carried out with Matlab R2006b and analyses were carried out with SPSS 20.0.  3. Results  Mood, sleep quality and sleep quantity were indistinguishable between conditions. Generally, the cognitive parameters did not show an effect for the helmet intervention, whereas most param- eters showed worsening performance with increasing time.

Follow-up univariate tests of within-participants contrasts suggested a linear effect of Time on displacement scores such that mean displacement tended uniformly to increase with time spent on the task (F1,18 ¬º 12.72, MSE ¬º 179.26, p ¬º 0.002, hp 2 ¬º 0.41) and a quadratic effect of Time on reaction time (F1,18 ¬º 5.75, MSE ¬º 0.001, p ¬º 0.028, hp 2 ¬º 0.24), caused by a tendency for reaction times during the Ô¨Årst and last 5-min blocks to be shorter than in the middle four. The VTT data are given in Fig. 3, with the exception of the false alarms. The AVT reaction time showed no effects of Time (Wilks‚Äôs l ¬º 0.77, F5,14 ¬º 0.85, p ¬º 0.537, hp 2 ¬º 0.23) or Helmet (Wilks‚Äôs l ¬º 0.96, F1,18 ¬º 0.81, p ¬º 0.381, hp 2 ¬º 0.04) and no interaction (Wilks‚Äôs l ¬º 0.69, F5,14 ¬º 1.26, p ¬º 0.333, hp 2 ¬º 0.31).

The accuracy data from the two tasks were analyzed using generalized linear mixed models with, as appropriate, Poisson error distributions and log link functions (for count data) or binomial error distributions and logit link functions (for pro- portions). Helmet use and Time were entered as Ô¨Åxed effects and a random effect term coded which scores were contributed by individual participants. The proportion of correct responses on VTT showed an effect of Time (F5,216 ¬º 11.47, p < 0.001) but no effect of Helmet 2.97, 0.086) and no Time  Helmet interaction (F5,216 ¬º 0.99, p ¬º 0.422). The Time effect was caused by a general decline in performance across the 6 5-min time blocks. Similar effects were seen for the VTT false alarms, in which the number of false alarms tended to increase across the Time blocks (F5,216 ¬º 7.22, p < 0.001) but showed no (F1,216 ¬º 1.90, p ¬º 0.169) action (F5,216 ¬º 0.38, p ¬º 0.866). The proportion of relationship to Helmet and no inter- correct re- (F5,216 ¬º 3.59, sponses on AVT similarly showed a Time effect p ¬º 0.004), although only the Ô¨Årst 5-min block differed from the (p ¬º 0.035), suggesting the effect of Time on this measure is last small. There was also a signiÔ¨Åcant effect of Helmet on the (F1,216 ¬º 4.64, p ¬º 0.032), but proportion of correct responses this too appears to be a minor effect, as a post-hoc contrast showed no difference (p ¬º 0.229).

For reasons that are not entirely clear, the Time effect in these data was carried by a higher number of false alarms in the second 5-min block than in the rest; other than this false alarm rates were comparable in each 5-min block.

Discussion  This study attempted to resolve earlier mixed Ô¨Åndings about the cognitive performance effects of wearing a helmet by using the most enclosed type of real-world helmet available. In addition, well-controlled laboratory conditions were created and the cogni- tive tasks were substantially demanding. These manipulations were intended to magnify any effects of wearing a helmet and so make them more visible. Under these harsh but realistic conditions the results suggest there is no substantial effect of a helmet on cognitive performance, even though subjectively participants found the helmet warm and uncomfortable. Most of the cognitive parameters that were measured indicated a reduction in attentional capacity over time. Such time effects are typical (Grier et al., 2003; Taylor et al., 2008) and are the motivation behind recommendations that people should not attempt pro- longed periods of cognitively demanding work in safety-critical situations. Such time effects are likely caused by a reduction in attention capacity (Grier et al., 2003; Hancock and Warm, 1989). An implication the presence of these time effects is that the cognitive tests and the protocol employed in the present study were sufÔ¨Å- ciently sensitive to changes in the participants‚Äô internal states. In addition, this suggests a meaning full level of sensitivity on cognitive performance, also if they would be caused by helmet- wearing. A potential drawback of cognitive examinations in which a participant carries out more than one task is the possibility of shifts in attention from one task to the other. To evaluate attention shifts between VTT and AVT, for each 5-min block a single value was calculated for each test. This was achieved as follows: First, the 30- min mean was subtracted from each 5-min interval for each participant; second, the sign was corrected for each parameter so that negative values represented worse performance relative to the  Fig. 3.

The data is represented as averages of 5 min  30-min average, and vice versa; third, these differences were divided by the SD obtained from the entire 30-min interval; Ô¨Ånally, the mean was taken from these normalized differences for all participants and parameters. For both VTT and AVT, Pearson‚Äôs cor- relations were calculated between these new measures for each participant, after applying linear detrending. If participants had switched attention from one in these data. This analysis gave r ¬º 0.21 task to another there should be negative correlations (0.26), with a nonsigniÔ¨Åcant correlation in 17 out of 19 partici- pants. Therefore, the Ô¨Çuctuations in VTT are in general not related to Ô¨Çuctuations in AVT, suggesting attention shifts did cause increased variance in the VTT and AVT data. The lack of substantial correlations in these data also suggests that VTT and AVT consume a different attention capacity, a common Ô¨Ånding in the cognitive literature (Brooks, 1968; Hirst and Kalmar, 1987). The present results are in line with two previous studies, which did not Ô¨Ånd an effect of passive headgear on cognitive performance (Hancock, 1983; Holt and Brainard, 1976). The former study used a simple arithmetic addition task, whereas the latter used a simple reaction time task. In contrast, the two other studies mentioned in the  reported at least one measured cognitive param- eter being affected by wearing a helmet (Hancock and Dirkin, 1982; Neave et al., 2004). Hancock and Dirkin (1982) used a central and peripheral visual choice reaction time, whereas Neave et al. (2004) used an extensive proprietary cognitive test battery. This pattern of Ô¨Åndings across the four earlier studies could suggests that any ef- fect of wearing a helmet is sufÔ¨Åciently subtle that it can only be seen when people‚Äôs cognitive resources are highly taxed.  The question, then, is why the present study, which arguably taxed participants more than in any previous study, found no real effect of helmet-wearing on cognitive performance. The four earlier studies all used a similar type of helmet, which was more open than the full-face, visored helmet used in the present study. However, it is not clear why this should lead to less interference in this study than the previous studies. Neave et al. (2004) used a notably different population to all the other studies (youths, with a mean age of 14.3  4.0 years), and had their participants undertake 30 min of physical exercise, which both make their study stand out from the rest. But whilst these differences could plausibly explain Neave et al. (2004) showing different results to the present study, it cannot explain why Hancock and Dirkin (1982) found an effect of helmet-wearing when this study did not. Most plausibly, the explanation for the overall pattern of results across these studies and the present study lies in helmet-wearing having a marginal effect on cognitive performance. Hancock and Dirkin (1982) measured a total of eight parameters but only report an effect of helmet-wearing on one. Neave et al. (2004) only found a helmet effect after their individual cognitive performance parameters were combined into composite measures. Their indi- vidual cognitive parameters did not show signiÔ¨Åcant effects of helmet-wearing (Neave, 2008, personal communication). The present study found an effect of wearing a helmet on one out of a total of nine cognitive parameters, and even then, this parameter did not remain signiÔ¨Åcant in a post-hoc test. Thus, it appears that if a helmet does cause an impairment of cognitive performance, such effects are small, and undetectable under well-controlled  Fig. 5.

Small ef- fects, of the type we are suggesting here, are difÔ¨Åcult to measure, and increase the risk of a Type 2 error. Therefore, a power analysis was carried out to verify the sensitivity of the present study in detecting small effects. The effect size for each of the cognitive parameters was calculated using G*Power 3.1.2 using: a ¬º 0.05, b ¬º 0.20, N ¬º 19. All other necessary inputs were directly derived from the data collected. The approach was to quantify, for each cognitive parameter measured in this study, the smallest effect size that our procedure and participant pool could detect. This analysis showed that, on average, we had sufÔ¨Åcient power to detect effect sizes of r2 ¬º 0.03 (0.02) or above. In the worst case, for the re- action time on the AVT, the present design has sufÔ¨Åcient power to detect an effect size of r2 ¬º 0.06 or above. Thus, the present study was able to measure small effects (by the criteria of Cohen, 1988) on cognitive performance had any existed.  5.  Conclusions  The present study assessed the effect of wearing a full-face helmet on cognitive performance under realistic but demanding conditions. One out of nine cognitive parameters showed a signif- icant effect, and this effect was marginal, disappearing in a post-hoc comparison. These results, together with previous studies, suggest that although people Ô¨Ånd wearing helmets in warm conditions subjectively uncomfortable, if wearing a helmet does impair cognitive performance, the effect is at worst marginal.

s0003687013001877,"  Military operations are widely dispersed across the globe to areas such as Africa, the Middle East, Europe, Asia, PaciÔ¨Åc regions, and throughout domestic and extended territories (Department of Defense, 2004; Nevola et al., 2010). One of the major challenges the military faces is sustainment of missions in diverse environment and operational situations. For instance, soldiers working in a battleÔ¨Åeld often wear body armor and use vehicles (e.g., High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicle [HMMWV], etc) in hot-dry Iraq air temperature: w50  C/dew point 13  C). Un- weather (e.g., der these extreme conditions, soldiers experience heat stress and are at inherently higher risk of thermal-related illnesses/injuries. Various strategies/guidelines have been developed to reduce the risk of heat illness for military personnel including early morning/ late night patrols, the usage of personnel cooling systems, appro- priate hydration, and heat acclimation prior to deployment (Department of the Army and Air Force, 2003; Epstein et al., 2012). However, methods are needed to quantify the effectiveness of these strategies in improving military personnel‚Äôs ability to sustain their  * Corresponding author.

An actual experimental method to replicate military working conditions can be ideal to verify if the strategies/guidelines are up-to-date (Nevola et al., 2004, 2010; Amos et al., 2000). However, this veriÔ¨Åcation method can be costly and time- consuming and it is difÔ¨Åcult to replicate or consider all possible military operational and environmental situations. Considering the above problem, human thermoregulatory models are being developed in the military. They variously predict physiological responses of military personnel and the probabilities of thermal-related illnesses/injuries, estimate safe thermal work times, and predict the time available for successful rescue (Berglund et al., 2006; Kraning and Gonzalez, 1997; Pandolf et al., 1986; Xu and Werner, 1997; Yokota et al., 2008). Thermoregula- tory models, consisting of series of biophysical processes and physiological control equations rationally integrated to represent the human thermal physiological mechanisms, can provide simu- lations of human thermo-physiological responses to various com- binations of environmental and operational conditions. These simulations can be conducted repeatedly and efÔ¨Åciently at low cost and without risk to human test volunteers. The various models enable and facilitate equipment, clothing and their design and mission planning to reduce heat illness related risks. Thermoregulatory models developed over the years include pioneering work (Gagge et al., 1986; Stolwijk and Hardy, 1966; Stolwijk, 1970; Werner and Buse, 1988; Wissler, 1964) and more modern successors including sophisticated models to represent detailed human body parts and models adaptable for different

However, utilization of these models to solve practical problems in working environments is infrequently reported. The purpose of this paper is to describe basic overviews of thermoregulatory models used by the US military together with examples of their usage and applications. The ultimate goal of the US military for utilizing thermoregulatory models is to prevent thermal-related illness/ injury, promote occupational safety, sustain operations, and maximize the physical performance of military personnel.  2. "
s0003687013001889,"  This paper is motivated by a number of intriguing observations made during a large-scale simulated command and control exercise (Walker et al., 2009; Stanton et al., 2009). The exercise had the explicit aim of testing a new method of collaborative working supported by a networked ‚Äòinfostructure‚Äô commonly referred to as Network Enabled Capability (NEC; e.g. Ferbrache, 2003; Alberts, 2003; Alberts et al., 1999). When the subsequent task analysis was scrutinised it was found that this socio-technical system was exhibiting unusual behaviour. Over time it became progressively more preoccupied with the ‚Äòmeans‚Äô to achieve a given end (the ‚Äòprocess‚Äô) rather than the massing of objectives or ‚Äòend states‚Äô (the ‚Äòoutput‚Äô). The latter focus on outputs is what is normally expected from NEC and what was expected in this case. Despite the provision of a networked information infrastructure, individuals and teams either used it in unpredictable ways or else adopted more familiar and presumably easier methods of working. To paraphrase Clegg (2000), what was witnessed were ‚Äúpeople interpreting the sys- tem, amending it, massaging it and making such adjustments as they saw Ô¨Åt and/or were able to undertake‚Äù (p. 467). Paradoxically,  * Corresponding author. E-mail address: G.H.Walker@hw.ac.uk (G.H. Walker).  what was designed to be a highly rational operation end up growing quite irrational (Ritzer, 1993, p.22). Experience over cen- turies of military command and control (e.g. Regan, 1991) make it possible to go further; the sociotechnical infrastructure put in place to manage large, complex, dynamic resource systems such as these can, if not designed correctly, actively create inefÔ¨Åciency (instead of efÔ¨Åciency), unpredictability (instead of predictability), incalcula- bility (instead of calculability) and a complete loss of control (Ritzer, 1993; Trist and Bamforth, 1951). These are the antithetical prob- lems, ironies, productivity paradoxes and ‚Äòirrationalities of ratio- nality‚Äô (Ritzer, 1993) that, when all else fails e as in this case e fall into the domain of Applied Ergonomics. On closer inspection Ô¨Åndings such as these are common, both in the Ô¨Åeld of military command and control and more generally in the sociotechnical literature. In the former case several studies have observed sub-optimal performance in terms of performance time (or the so-called Observe, Orient, Decide, Act loop; Stanton et al., 2009), task accuracy (or more speciÔ¨Åcally fratricide/friendly Ô¨Åre;- Rafferty et al., 2012), not to mention overall system effectiveness. The UK‚Äôs nascent NEC capability has already been the subject of a high proÔ¨Åle parliamentary inquiry due to ¬£4.7 bn of expenditure failing to translate into more effective command and control (House of Commons, 2007). The wider sociotechnical literature presents an interesting counterpoint. It abounds with examples of favourable ‚Äòjoint optimisation‚Äô of people and management  0003-6870/$ e see front matter √ì 2013 Elsevier Ltd and The Ergonomics Society.

Indeed, if military operations really are as enormously complex as commentators feel, and complexity theory is the appropriate response, then by extension command and control should organise best from the bottom-up (Cebrowski and Gartska, 1998, p. 4e5). In other words, the component in these systems best able to cope with complexity is the humans. This creates a different interpretation of the results that motivate this study. Drawing from the emerging world of networked technologies such as the internet (the world from whence NEC concepts seem to have been derived in most cases) it is possible to discern powerful new trends whereby this form of human adaptability, far from being commanded and controlled out of existence, is instead actively exploited. From the sublime (e.g. the Human Genome Project) to the ephemeral (e.g. Facebook), both are networked, highly distributed systems embodying the diffuse non-linear cau- sality of peers inÔ¨Çuencing peers (Kelly, 1994; Tapscott and Williams, 2007; Viegas et al., 2007). These are entities where the boundary between designers and users has become ‚Äúhighly blurred, highly permeable, or non-existent‚Äù (Scacchi, 2004, p. 6e7). Under these ‚Äòinitial conditions‚Äô highly effective and agile forms of organisational infrastructure have ‚Äòemerged‚Äô rather than been created. To use TofÔ¨Çer‚Äôs (1981) or Tapscott and William‚Äôs (2007) phraseology, the participants in the motivating case study behaved rather like ‚Äòprosumers‚Äô, individuals who see the ability to adapt, massage, cajole and generally ‚Äòhack‚Äô a new technology as a birth right (p. 32). In the Ergonomics world Shorrock and Straeter (2006) remind us that people are still needed in complex command and control systems precisely because of this, and that human adaptability is inevitable (Hollnagel, 1993). So perhaps a more useful way to look at NEC is not to see it as an end product or an entity that ‚Äòis‚Äô something, but rather as a process, something that ‚Äòbecomes‚Äô (e.g. Houghton et al., 2006). It seems possible to go even further, to argue that an alternative conception of NEC is not something that can be called a Ô¨Ånished article, but rather as the initial conditions from which the most adaptable component of all, the humans in the system, create the end product most useful for their particular set of circumstances. Even then, this adaptation may prove Ô¨Çeeting and highly context dependant. The purpose of this paper is to take the anecdotal evidence observed in the Ô¨Åeld and try to recreate, if not the exact situation, then at least conceptually similar conditions in the laboratory. The advantage of this, of course, is the degree of control that can be imposed, control that was almost entirely lacking in the case study example that has brought us to this point. Caution, however, needs to be exercised. Paradoxically, too much control could conceivably prevent the emergence of the adaptive behaviour being sought, so a novel approach to experimental design needs to be adopted. In the present study what might be referred to as a classic hierarchical command and control organisation (so called ‚Äòclassic C2‚Äô) was created within a simulated environment, then pitted against a peer- to-peer NEC counterpart, both of which contained live actors who had to operate within a complex, adaptive, high tempo scenario. Both conditions represent ‚Äòframeworks‚Äô that people undertake a common task within but different constraints apply to the different conditions. For example, there is relatively little in the way of rigid task speciÔ¨Åcation in the NEC condition (the focus is on outcomes not actions) and the technological infrastructure is conÔ¨Ågured to facil- itate peer-to-peer interaction. The opposite is true for the C2 con- dition. Here there is a high degree of ‚Äòscripting of tasks‚Äô and a more constrained technological infrastructure within which this occurs. Manipulations such as these have (and continue) to be of importance within the Ergonomic literature (e.g. Sinclair et al.,  2012). The research question links to wider debates within Applied Ergonomics around collaboration (e.g. Patel, Pettitt and Wilson, 2012) and organisational/group learning (Guimaraes et al., 2012). The same artefacts have been observed beyond the Ô¨Åeld of Ergonomics in a number of recent studies in the specialised command and control literature (Stanton et al., 2012, 2009; Bordetsky and Netzer, 2010). Common to these studies is a break from the traditional human centred approaches wherein the interaction and subsequent representations are generally static (Lee, 2001; Woods and Dekker, 2000). In this study we continue to assume they are dynamic. There is a good basis for this. Patrick, James and Ahmed (2006) for one recognise the ‚Äòunfolding‚Äô nature of command and control in their particular ‚Äòprocess based‚Äô meth- odology. They state that, ‚ÄúA critical feature of command and control in safety critical systems is not only the dynamically evolving sit- uation or state of the plant but also the Ô¨Çuctuating responsibilities, goals and interaction of team members‚Äù (p. 1396). Our experi- mental design needs to take such factors into consideration but there is a trade-off. The link between the ‚Äòunfolding‚Äô nature of command and control and the resulting human interaction is no longer a direct one. There is also the likelihood of hidden variables that cannot be known in advance. Despite this there is a wider cybernetic principle at work: ‚Äúif all the variables are tightly coupled, and if you can truly manipulate one [or a few] of them in all its freedoms, then you can indirectly control all of them‚Äù (Kelly, 1994, p. 121). In regard to human performance under different command and control paradigms the central question is related as much to the outright relative performance of the two organisations, the ‚Äòshort term‚Äô end product (and what is normally measured) as it is to the pattern of adaptation and how performance changes over time, or the ‚Äòlong term‚Äô end product. In other words, the central question relates to the system that the users ‚Äòdesign for themselves‚Äô by undertaking whatever adaptations they feel able and necessary, factors that are not normally measured. Whilst the promise of NEC leads us to anticipate better initial conditions for more effective adaptation, the sociotechnical ‚Äòmodel‚Äô needs to be run in order to Ô¨Ånd out.  2. Method  2.1. Design  The experimental task is based around a simpliÔ¨Åed ‚ÄòMilitary Operations in Urban Terrain‚Äô (MOUT) game called ‚ÄòSafe houses‚Äô. The game creates a dual task paradigm. The Ô¨Årst task involves a com- mander managing two live Ô¨Åre teams as they negotiate an urban environment en-route to a ‚Äòsafe house‚Äô. The second task involves the commander managing the activities of ten further simulated Ô¨Åre teams within a much wider Area of Operations. The two tasks interact such that success in one does not necessarily connote success overall. It falls to the commander to effectively balance task demands under the independent, between subjects variable of command and control ‚Äòtype‚Äô, which has two levels: NEC and C2. The study is longitudinal in nature. The two teams (NEC and C2) separately undertook a total of thirty iterations through the same dynamic task paradigm and a form of time series analysis was employed to reveal the underlying ‚Äòadaptive model‚Äô embedded in the data. Participant matching and task randomisation were employed to control for individual differences and task artefacts respectively. The dependant variables focus on performance and were as follows:   Task completion time,  Attrition  Enemies Neutralised.

Good performance in terms of these task based measures equates to the shortest time taken, all en-route Target Areas of Interest (TAI‚Äôs) correctly located and effected, and a high ratio of enemy to friendly agents neutralised. In general terms, prior research would lead us to hypothesise that the simple organisation design (NEC) will allow the actors to perform more complex tasks, thereby exhibiting greater degrees of adaptability from initial conditions. This is compared to the more complex organisation (C2) which requires actors to perform a greater number of simpler, more scripted tasks, in which it might be anticipated that greater, more malevolent environmental dynamism and complexity will arise along with poorer agility and performance.  2.2.  Participants  There are Ô¨Åve principal roles in the study, three of which were occupied by experimental participants (all aged 21) who were recruited from Brunel University. The remaining two roles were Ô¨Ålled by the experimenters. The participants were recruited via on-campus media and publicity and were not previously known by the experimental team. It should be emphasised that the experimental team did not interact/engage with the participants beyond the requirements of their assigned role, and the study was monitored throughout by a senior lead investigator. The Ô¨Åve principal roles were as follows:  2.2.1. NEC system operator (experimenter)  In general, the NEC system operator deals with the experimental aspects of the Commander‚Äôs Primary Task (managing the Ô¨Åre teams) as well as the NEC system itself. Thus the Ô¨Årst experimenter effectively ‚Äòdrives‚Äô the NEC command wall system, receiving re- quests to add/append data to the live maps from the commander and helping them to use the system themselves. The system operator also supplies strategic ‚Äòinjects‚Äô according to pre-set rules dependent on experimental condition and the state of game play. In the NEC condition, the experimenter also provides situational up- dates to all team members (ensuring that ‚Äòeveryone‚Äô knows  ‚Äòeverything‚Äô). The NEC system operator did not provide any inter- action beyond these requirements.  2.2.2.  Commander (participant)  The incumbent of this role was in charge of both Ô¨Åre teams (within the Primary Task), providing guidance and strategy as required, they were also responsible for the larger strategic Sec- ondary Task.  2.2.3.  Fire team Alpha (participant)  This participant was located within the live battlespace and communicated to the commander, and depending on experimental condition, the other Ô¨Åre team as well, by using an XDA mobile device and MSN Messenger√î. The XDA device also enabled the Ô¨Åre team to be live tracked and represented on the commander‚Äôs command wall representation of the battlespace.  2.2.4.  Fire team Bravo (participant)  This participant had the same role and capabilities as Fire team Alpha.  2.2.5.  Enemy (experimenter)  This individual, like the NEC system operator, was another member of the experimental team physically separated from the battlespace and from the commander. They were in charge of playing the commander (to the best of their abilities) in the Sec- ondary Task, thus they controlled enemy actions in a ‚Äòwizard of oz‚Äô fashion. The instructions given to this role were explicit: to ‚Äòtry and beat their opponent‚Äô, whom they did not know or see for the duration of the study.  2.3. Materials  2.3.1.

G.H. Walker et al.  / Applied Ergonomics 45 (2014) 706e713  709  Both Ô¨Åre teams (Alpha and Bravo) were located in the Brunel Battlespace, away from the co-located commander and system operator. The Ô¨Åre teams carried an XDA mobile phone device. This permitted them to be live tracked using GPS. The XDA device also allowed each Ô¨Åre team to communicate with each other and also, depending on experimental condition, the commander in the control centre (via MSN Messenger√î). Fire teams could add icons into their own version of the digital map which would then simultaneously appear on each other‚Äôs screens and the main visu- alisation window in the control centre. The digital map shown on the Ô¨Åre teams XDA screens was also used for navigation purposes.  2.3.2.  Command and command paradigms  The NATO SAS-050 model of command and control () was used to design command architectures that exhibited appropriate NEC and C2 characteristics as shown in Table 1.  2.3.3.  ‚ÄúSafe houses‚Äù game (primary task)  The goal of the primary task (that of Brunel battlespace) is to:  the live Ô¨Åre team in the  ‚ÄúExecute a concentrated and simultaneous operation to disrupt a named suspect by searching his house in order to gather ev- idence to disrupt and dislocate enemy force elements within that Area of Operations‚Äù(MoD, 2005).  Practically, this involves the Ô¨Åre team choosing and negotiating a route through the urban battlespace in order to correctly locate and effect the safe house, dealing with Target Areas of Interest (TAI‚Äôs) en-route, with each team having to collaborate by providing cover for each other. Both Ô¨Åre teams start from the same location. The location of the safe house, the Ô¨Ånal destination, is randomised for each trial but with distance from start point controlled. The Area of Operations (AO) for the primary task is scattered with numerous TAI‚Äôs so that an equal number of TAI‚Äôs will be encountered ‚Äòen-route‚Äô (and regardless of route chosen). Firstly, each of these ‚Äòen-route‚Äô TAI‚Äôs has to be correctly located by one of the Ô¨Åre teams. Correct location of a TAI is judged to have occurred when the Ô¨Åre team takes up position at the same grid coordinates as the TAI. Missing out a TAI by failure to locate it will result in the offending Ô¨Åre team being removed from the mission and having to return to the start point for the remainder of the trial. Secondly, assuming the en-route TAI has been correctly located, the Ô¨Åre team then has to ‚Äòeffect‚Äô it in order to make it safe for the other Ô¨Åre team to continue on their route. Although the location of the TAI is known by the Ô¨Åre team and commander a-priori, what is not known is what form the TAI actually takes and the most appropriate way to ‚Äòeffect‚Äô it. This can only be judged by the Ô¨Åre team who are on the ground and are able to make that assessment based on a number of simple local characteristics. These are as follows:   If the TAI is located on a building over three stories high then a ‚Äòyellow effect‚Äô will neutralise it (signiÔ¨Åed by the relevant Ô¨Åre team using their XDA to place a yellow icon on the appropriate grid coordinate).  If the TAI is located on a building less than three stories high, then a ‚Äòblue effect‚Äô will neutralise it (signiÔ¨Åed by a blue icon being placed). the TAI is located in a busy thorough fare with retail outlets then a ‚Äòpink effect‚Äô will neutralise it (signiÔ¨Åed by a pink icon).   f  After conÔ¨Årmation that this information has been received, the relevant Ô¨Åre team will hold in this position, providing cover for the other Ô¨Åre team as they make their way to the next TAI. This  Fig. 2. Scatterplot showing the regression lines relation to task time.  for both NEC and C2 conditions  in  The system operator and commander were co-located in Brunel University‚Äôs BIT Lab. Both sat with a clear view of the command wall which contained a Google Earth√î representation of the virtual battlespace with the position of the Ô¨Åre teams represented by an icon derived from GPS data (thus positional tracking of the Ô¨Åre teams was live). This visualisation window was supplemented by a planning window which contained a map based representation of the same environment with a grid square coordinate system. The planning window allowed the system operator and commander to add, delete and move objects as required by the primary and sec- ondary tasks, which were then instantaneously represented on the main visualisation window. The planning window was populated by the experimenter (before the condition commenced) with all the required TAI‚Äôs and enemy icons according to a pre-set template randomly selected for that trial. The commander and system operator had separate work stations and their own computer, and communicated purely through text based means (using MSN Messenger√î).  Fig. 3.

Walker et al.  / Applied Ergonomics 45 (2014) 706e713  Table 1 NATO SAS 050 Model of Command and Control was used to design NEC and C2 command organisations with the appropriate characteristics.  NEC  C2  Distribution of information  Patterns of interaction  Allocation of decision rights  BROAD: Ô¨Åre teams are provided with regular situation updates from the system operator (in addition to being able to interact directly with their counterparts). ‚ÄòEveryone‚Äô knows ‚Äòeverything‚Äô. DISTRIBUTED: all team member roles can speak to each other independently (there is no communications hierarchy). PEER TO PEER: collaborative working encouraged and facilitated by outcomes based instructions and communications infrastructure.  TIGHT: the commander is the only individual with an overall view of the situation. The Ô¨Åre teams had a local view of their immediate location but in all other respects work in isolation. ‚ÄòEveryone does not know everything‚Äô. HIERARCHIAL: the sensor(s) and effector could speak to the commander but not directly to each other  UNITARY: autonomy, authority and discretion rested with the commander who deÔ¨Åned and scripted tasks.  ‚Äòleapfrogging‚Äô effect continues until, Ô¨Ånally, the safe house itself is located and affected in the same way. It should be pointed out that in the NEC condition this leap frogging is facilitated by the Ô¨Åre teams being able to communicate directly with each other via their XDA‚Äôs, in the C2 condition, however, communication (and in- structions) have to pass through and/or come from the commander. In order to further encourage the need for communication and interaction there is also a degree of built-in ambiguity in the po- sitional data. This means that part of the adaptive process of the entire team is to Ô¨Ågure out ‚Äòwork arounds‚Äô and modes of operation that enable these ambiguities to be resolved in whatever way is found to be most efÔ¨Åcient. For example, both teams developed a form of ‚Äòcommunications protocol‚Äô in which the Ô¨Åeld operatives reported-in whenever they began to move (due to lag in the posi- tional data), and began to develop abbreviations and code words for locations around the Area of Operations. Some of the adapta- tions that were possible, and might have been predicted in the NEC condition, failed to emerge in practice, as the Results describe in full. The need for good time and accuracy performance is embedded in the game by two simple game-play expedients. As mentioned before, if the wrong location is chosen or the TAI is ignored then the Ô¨Åre team allocated to it fails the mission and has to sit out the remainder of the trial. If the right location but wrong effect is applied then the Ô¨Åre team‚Äôs attrition score, which acts rather like a ‚Äòlife score‚Äô, starting at Ô¨Åve and meaning ‚Äòfull strength‚Äô through to zero, meaning ‚Äòneutralised and unable to continue the task‚Äô, is decremented. The attrition score is not just affected by accuracy but also speed and time. Five time activated attrition injects occur randomly throughout the 15 min allotted to the trial, these cause both Ô¨Åre team‚Äôs attrition scores to be decremented. As a result, the longer the Ô¨Åre team takes, the longer they expose themselves to the deleterious effects of the experimental injects. This combines with accuracy: the less accurate they are the lower the score. What appears to be a relatively complex set of rules becomes considerably simpliÔ¨Åed as far as the experimental participants are concerned. The system operator (who is a member of the experi- mental team) undertakes all game play management tasks such as maintaining the formal record of ‚Äòlocation accuracy‚Äô, ‚Äòeffect concordance‚Äô (whether the right effect has been applied) the attrition score, enactment of the time based attrition injects, and communicates all of this to the commander as required.  2.3.4.  Secondary task (commander)  The commanders mission:  secondary  task is based on the  following  Whilst the Ô¨Årst task concerns the activities of a live Ô¨Åre team in a live environment, the secondary task of the commander is simu- lated and occurs in a much wider Area of Operations (the bound- aries are six miles in either direction from the AO of the Ô¨Årst task). This larger strategic mission relies on the commander playing a competitive game against a simulated ‚Äòenemy‚Äô, played by the experimenter acting in a wizard of oz fashion. Thus ‚Äòlive‚Äô (small AO) and ‚Äòsimulated‚Äô (large AO) elements are played simultaneously on the same NEC system. While the live Ô¨Åre team progress towards their primary target within their smaller AO, wider enemy activity is taking place all around which, if permitted to continue, will eventually impinge on the primary task. Such impingement, under certain speciÔ¨Åed con- ditions, will mean that the primary task fails regardless of the ef- Ô¨Åcacy of the Ô¨Åre teams. The onus is thus on the commander to manage both tasks effectively. In the commander‚Äôs wider area of operations there are 15 enemy elements/icons dispersed randomly around the environment. These icons are placed according to a random script for that trial by the experimenter acting in the ‚Äòenemy‚Äô role. Enemy icons, due to the asymmetry of most MOUT-type situa- tion, are free to move across the battlespace at will (no area is restricted to them). The commander has 25 friendly force icons/ elements all massed in a deÔ¨Åned ‚Äògreen zone‚Äô, this is their starting position. Although more numerous, the friendly icons are not permitted to enter pre-deÔ¨Åned ‚Äòsensitive areas‚Äô. Apart from these constraints, the game plays like a virtual game of ‚Äòdraughts‚Äô in which the grid square system of the map serves as a form of draughts board. Only one icon can be moved, one square at a time (in any direction) in enemy reaction, friendly counter action, enemy counter re-action, and so on in sequence. If the friendly icon enters a grid square occupied by an enemy icon then the friendly icon wins. If the enemy icon enters a grid square occupied by a friendly icon, the enemy wins. The experi- menter playing the role of enemy updates the icons/map accord- ingly (and keeps a record of the game score). The enemy‚Äôs‚Äô objectives are to reach several other enemy safe houses dotted around the AO (one of which is the primary target for the live Ô¨Åre team). Every enemy icon that enters the grid square occupied by a safe house is safe and no longer available to be ‚Äòcaptured or neutralised‚Äô and thus no longer able to contribute to an ‚Äòenemy captured/neutralised‚Äô score. As a result, the onus on the commander is to capture/neutralise the enemies before they reach a safe house, and preferably, neutralising the safe house before enemies start to reach it, hence the phrase ‚Äòdisrupt‚Äô and ‚Äòdislocate‚Äô.  ‚ÄúExecute a concentrated and simultaneous operation to disrupt named suspects by searching their houses in order to gather evidence to disrupt and dislocate the enemy force within West London‚Äù  2.4.1.

Detailed instructions on the task are then provided to all participants, supplemented with demonstrations and hands-on examples. The experimenter then uses the pre-populated com- mand wall to begin the Ô¨Årst full trial which is identical in all re- spects to the experimental trials but serves as a practice (both teams are measured subsequently as an internal check on concor- dance between them). The sensor is equipped with the XDA and briefed by the com- mander, with the help of the study team, as to the mission objec- tives. The start point of the study is Brunel University‚Äôs BIT Lab: the study is timed from the moment the Ô¨Åre teams leave. The com- mander is seated in front of their own laptop computer and the command wall. With all participants ready the practice trial com- mences with help, facilitation and intervention from the experi- mental team as required. The System Operator manages the experimental tasks associated with the Primary Task (attrition scores, communications updates e where required and permitted e and timing). The Enemy plays the commander concurrently ac- cording to the rules of the game. After a maximum of 15 min (or sooner if the Primary Task is complete) the trial is halted, the MSN transcripts are saved/archived along with those of the command wall‚Äôs system logs.  2.4.2.  Experimental phase (day #2e30)  With the participants familiar with the broad paradigm the teams begin to undertake the repeated iterations of the experi- mental trials in both conditions. Issues and questions are dealt with before the trial starts and during it if required. The task gets un- derway and the participants interact in the manner prescribed by the organisational type they are currently working within.  3. Results  To brieÔ¨Çy recap, participants took part in a simulated MOUT mission over thirty successive iterations. The analysis, therefore, focuses on how the different constraints of NEC and C2 inÔ¨Çuenced the direction of team adaptation and performance. It is hypoth- esised that NEC provides better conditions for adaptation but linear regression is used as a form of time series analysis (see also Agha and Alnahhal, 2012) in order to uncover the underlying theory behind the data and thus to test this supposition.  3.1.  Task time  Both teams (C2 and NEC) were measured in terms of how long it took the live Ô¨Åre team to perform their task. When this Ô¨Årst task was complete then both tasks of the dual task paradigm were halted. The maximum amount of time that was allowed to be spent on the task was 15 min (900 s). As one would expect, over the course of the thirty iterations both teams sped up considerably and continued to do so for every trial. A strong association between task time and trial was obtained for both conditions (NEC r ¬º  0.84 and C2 r ¬º  0.85), both of which were signiÔ¨Åcant at beyond the 1% level. Furthermore, the regression ANOVA supports the hypotheses that this association is linear in nature for the NEC condition: F(1,28) ¬º 64.74; p < 0.01 and F(1,28) ¬º 73.53; p < 0.01 for the C2 condition. The linear regression model Ô¨Åtted to the data accounted for 69% of the variance in the NEC condition (Adjusted R2 ¬º 0.69) and 71% of the variance in the C2 condition (Adjusted R2 ¬º 0.71). Both values represent a large effect size and both regression models were sta- tistically signiÔ¨Åcant to beyond the 1% level. The regression equa- tion, however, differed between the two conditions. The intercept the C2 condition was at b0 ¬º 862 s, for somewhat nearer the maximum value of 900 s permissible for the task than the NEC  b0 ¬º 762 condition, whose intercept was at s. However, the regression line for the C2 condition had a slightly more precipitous for the NEC condition, b1 ¬º  14.26 compared to slope than that b1 ¬º  19.73, thus despite the higher intercept the regression lines actually crossed at trial 17 meaning that by trial 30 the regression model predicts the task being completed in 270 s for the C2 con- dition compared to 334 s for the NEC condition (approximately a minute faster). This represents a small effect (rbis ¬º 0.17) but one that an analysis of covariance reveals as signiÔ¨Åcant at the 7% level (t ¬º 1.88, df ¬º 56, p ¬º 0.07). This is an encouraging Ô¨Ånding given the exploratory nature of the study, its novel methodology and small sample size. Taken in isolation it appears that that the NEC condi- tion favours initial time adaptation with the C2 condition yielding longer term improvements and faster times.  3.2. Attrition  The live Ô¨Åre teams performing the primary task were given an attrition score rather similar to the kind of ‚Äòlives left‚Äô score given in computer games. The attrition score, which begins at Ô¨Åve, is diminished through a) time based injects, so the longer that is spent on the task the more chance there is of having the score decre- mented, and b), if locations of TAI‚Äôs and markers placed at them are inappropriate and/or inaccurate then the attrition score is also subtracted. A high attrition score connotes better performance. In both conditions the attrition score is positively correlated with the number of trials undertaken, r ¬º 0.8, p < 0.01 for the NEC condition and r ¬º 0.53, p < 0.01 for the C2 condition. The regression F(1,28) ¬º 48.55; p < 0.01 for NEC and F(1,28) ¬º 11.09; p < 0.01 for ANOVA supports the hypothesis of linearity in both cases: C2. Note, however, that despite the statistical signiÔ¨Åcance of these regression diagnostics the C2 condition possess less statistical po- wer in terms of its associative performance (r), linearity (F) and also in the amount of variance explained by the regression model (R2 ¬º 0.26 compared to NEC‚Äôs 0.62). In model terms the regression coefÔ¨Åcient (the slope of the regression line) was similar for NEC and C2, being 0.08 and 0.09 respectively. The intercept values were, however, different. The C2 model starts with a lower attrition score of 1.5 and maintains a subordinate position to NEC (whose intercept is 1.98) for the duration of the longitudinal testing and data collection intervals. Both of these regression models were statistically signiÔ¨Åcant to beyond the 1% level. An analysis of covariance conÔ¨Årms the visual impression of the data by detecting a very strong and statistically signiÔ¨Åcant effect (t ¬º 47.2  104, df ¬º 56, p < 0.01, rbis ¬º 1.0). So despite C2‚Äôs favourable evolution towards faster task completion times (as shown above) it is not all good news. Attrition in the C2 condition is statistically worse than the NEC condition, in other words, additional organisational structure in the C2 condition does not necessarily lead to better performance.  3.3.  Enemies neutralised  This factor relates most strongly to the commander‚Äôs perfor- mance in the secondary task (within the wider area of operations). It can be immediately noted that the commander was able to manage these competing tasks satisfactorily, with the secondary task at no time causing the premature cessation of the primary task. That said, it did compete for the commander‚Äôs attention and thus inÔ¨Çuenced their performance. The assumptions underlying a linear approach to time series analysis are not met in the case of friendly versus enemy capture ratio. In other words, trial number or task iteration appeared not to be a good predictor of this factor‚Äôs performance. In both cases only (r ¬º 0.3/0.24) correlations were detected for NEC and C2 small  
712  G.H. Walker et al.  / Applied Ergonomics 45 (2014) 706e713  respectively, albeit statistically signiÔ¨Åcant. However, the fact that the resultant regression model only explained around 6e9% of the variance in the data (R2 ¬º 0.09/0.06), the hypothesis regarding F(1,28 ¬º 2.75/1.64); p ¬º ns linearity was not supported: and, furthermore, both regression models failed to reach signiÔ¨Åcance (p ¬º ns) means that this form of analysis is abandoned. Given the lack of a linear relationship between trial and capture ratio a simple cross-sectional approach can be taken. Even here, however, an independent samples t-test failed to detect a statistically signiÔ¨Åcant difference in capture ratio between NEC and C2 (t ¬º 1.48; df ¬º 58; p ¬º ns). Given that such a test possesses in excess of 80% power to detect medium effect sizes or larger, and that only a very small effect was actually detected (rbis ¬º 0.04), means that there is a high degree of conÔ¨Ådence in stating that the constraints imposed by both NEC and C2 conditions are not a particularly meaningful determinant of enemy versus friendly capture ratio. In other words, C2 evolves towards faster task completion times, but with poorer accuracy, but both NEC and C2 are comparable in terms of the numbers of ‚Äòfriendlies‚Äô and ‚Äòen- emies‚Äô captured.  4.  Conclusions  The results, in summary, show that the traditional command and control condition is good at optimising task completion times, starting off slower than NEC but catching up and overtaking it. Optimisation of task time, however, comes with no beneÔ¨Åt to other factors, in particular, the C2 condition is less accurate. What the NEC condition loses in task time (approximately 1 min) it ‚Äògains‚Äô in accuracy and remains stable in terms of enemies neutralised. The main lesson to learn from this study is the instability of the human- system interaction and the impact this has on how future studies could or should be considered. If the human-system interaction had been assumed to be stable the results would have been quite different. Even allowing for not just one but several practice or control trials, the NEC condition would have posted faster task completion times than the traditional command and control con- dition. The trade-off, of course, is that what is gained with a repeated measures study is lost in terms of the diversity and size of the sample. To gain this back would inevitably require considerably more experimental resources than is presently common. Thus a broader lesson can be extracted, which is to adopt a contingent approach. To determine, Ô¨Årst of all, the likely instability in the human-system interaction of interest and approach the study design with that in mind. For ‚Äòstable‚Äô problems the conventional cross-sectional study will perform well. For ‚Äòunstable‚Äô interactions, the type of study undertaken here may well reveal the real un- derlying phenomena of interest. In doing so, the present study gives us insights into the following:   The emergent nature of command and control: Participants did indeed perform adaptations to the way they carried out their task within the conÔ¨Ånes of the study. This methodological suc- cess shows that these open-systems properties can be instan- tiated (and measured) in a laboratory setting, which...  .led to a degree of unpredictability in the NEC condition: This behaviour matched that observed in the previous live case study which motivated the current paper. It was hypothesised that NEC would increase tempo, and had a static view of the human system interaction been taken this view could be upheld. But with NEC representing an initial condition from which adapta- tions could take place, this hypothesis was not supported, however.  .are we comparing like with like? With more than one factor to optimise is the fact that NEC was slower really very meaningful?  Perhaps not. Whereas the more traditional hierarchical com- mand and control condition accelerated task completion times this came at a cost to other factors, a cost that the NEC condition was able to trade-off and optimise. How these two organisation types are able to balance and optimise more factors than those present in the current study requires further research, but the possible relationship between the ‚Äòrigidity‚Äô of a team structure (i.e. hierarchical command and control) versus its output Ô¨Çexi- bility (i.e. ability to optimise more than one process outcome) is an intriguing one with numerous analogues in the literature.  As the case study(s) that have motivated this work have already hinted, NEC-like organisations often exhibit paradoxical behaviour. The NEC condition ‚Äòshould‚Äô have been faster, but actually, the scope of adjustments available (and actually made by the incumbents of the team roles) meant that task time was not elevated to the status of single most important priority. This, surely, is a desirable outcome given the inherent complexity, dynamism and asymmetry present in the context within which these organisations operate. Perhaps this is the hallmark of what NEC is really all about? The greater extent of open systems behaviour is what seems to enable the NEC organisation to undertake a more complex process of optimisation compared to its hierarchically organised counterpart. The take home message seems to be that this situation can be made to arise by creating the optimum conditions for the most adaptable, open-systems component of all in NEC: the human.  5.

s0003687013001890,"  CamouÔ¨Çage is an important part of the modern military. Cam- ouÔ¨Çage is used to disrupt the contour of a target by merging it with the background, making it harder to detect or hit. Military cam- ouÔ¨Çage must be used against different backgrounds and in different natural environments, including jungles, woodlands, and deserts (Hogervorst et al., 2010). Two visible trends dominate camouÔ¨Çage design today. One is universal design, and the other is specialized design, or using separate designs for desert environments. Clearly, a universal pattern will not perform better than a specialized pattern (Hogervorst et al., 2010). Traditionally, designs were inspired by natural environments and based on biological or psychological principles such as blending and disruption. More recently, the multiple disciplines of image stimuli processing, computer vision, statistics, human visual perception, and ergonomics have been in- tegrated into the design considerations of camouÔ¨Çage (Nicholas et al., 2011; Troscianko et al., 2009; Copeland and Trivedi, 2001; Toet et al., 1998). The most challenging aspect of camouÔ¨Çage assessment of different camouÔ¨Çage patterns and battleÔ¨Åelds is that it is hard to measure the effective acuity of the camouÔ¨Çage. Traditionally, sub- jective assessments, such as questionnaires, were used for testing,  * Corresponding author.

Lee).  but such approaches lack the support of experimental data. Other subjective assessment methods have also been developed. Photo- simulation, for example, presents a set of image slides of camou- Ô¨Çaged targets against preferred backgrounds for participants to identify the performance of the designs visually and subjectively (Doll et al., 1993; Boyce and Pollatsek, 1992). Using simulations has the advantage of measuring performance under controlled condi- tions by bringing battleÔ¨Åeld images to the participant, rather than bringing the participant to the battleÔ¨Åeld. In fact, the research of the NATO Workshop SCI-012 noted that man-in-the-loop assess- ment was still the only robust and effective way to evaluate cam- ouÔ¨Çage detectability (Toet, 2000; Doll and Home, 1999). Much of the previous visual search research attempted to use response time (RT) and error rate to evaluate camouÔ¨Çage effects on the human visual system. It was found that error rates or hit rates in the target- present (TP) data and in the target-absent (TA) data sometimes did not have sufÔ¨Åcient sensitivity to reÔ¨Çect the performance of the human vision system (Neider et al., 2010; Neider and Zelinsky, 2006; Wolfe et al., 2002). In this paper, we focus on the fact that detailed information on human visual responses is needed for measuring camouÔ¨Çage performance. One way to measure human visual responses is to use an eye tracker. The eye tracker has been applied in several Ô¨Åelds to mea- sure and record human eye movement information so that re- searchers can know where participants are looking at any given time and trace the eye movement from one position to another. The use of eye trackers in experiments was Ô¨Årst pioneered in reading research over 40 years ago (Rayner, 1998).

C.J. Lin et al.  / Applied Ergonomics 45 (2014) 714e723  715  have allowed the design of innovative eye movement experiments in which the visual tracker system is changed contingent on experimental demands, such as computational support in designing stimulus displacement conditions and organizing other bottom-up input in eye tracker systems (McConkie and Currie, 1996). General theories of language processing (Findlay, 2004; Liversedge and Findlay, 2000), attention (Kimble et al., 2010), and spatial ability (Alexander, 2006) were developed using eye tracker systems for critical examination of the cognitive processes under- lying reading. Although many studies of eye movement have focused on reading, relatively few studies have focused on visual searches (Rayner, 1998). For example, Boersema et al. (1989) presented tasks using pictorial stimuli for tracking eye movements. Najemnik and Geisler (2005) used an eye tracker to design experiments to determine optimal eye movement strategies. Zelinsky (1996) recorded eye saccades to assess the selectivity of search move- ments. In the military Ô¨Åeld, Hauland (2003) investigated situational awareness in air-trafÔ¨Åc-control training, and that research was helpful in evaluating the design of cockpit controls to reduce pilot error (Casner, 2009; Hanson, 2004). Eye trackers have also been used to investigate threatening stimuli in veterans of war (Kimble et al., 2010). From the above studies, it was found that the nature of a search task affects the behavior of eye movement, and that every statement about visual search or eye movements must be qualiÔ¨Åed by the characteristics of the search experiment. The most important Ô¨Åndings were that these measurements included not only traditional psychophysical factors, such as response times and error rates, but also more detailed data, such as eye-movement trajectories. Analyzing the search strategy or procedure is helpful because visual information that shares certain characteristics with target items often attracts a disproportionately large number of Ô¨Åxations or saccades (Di Stasi et al., 2011; Duchowski, 2003; Rao et al., 2002). Several eye movement variables have been used in past visual search investigations. Goldberg and Kotval (1999) employed the following: (1) Number of Fixations: The number of Ô¨Åxations is related to the number of components that the user is required to process. When searching for a single target, a large number of Ô¨Åxations indicates that the participant sampled many other objects prior to selecting the target, as in cases where something hindered attention or distracted the participant from isolating the target. For example, in the study by Goldberg and Kotval, a poor interface, intentionally designed to mislead the subject, produced signiÔ¨Å- cantly more Ô¨Åxations than a good design. In short, a higher overall number of Ô¨Åxations indicates a less efÔ¨Åcient search. (2) Fixation Duration: Also in a study by Goldberg and Kotval (1999), a longer Ô¨Åxation implied the participant was spending more time inter- preting or relating the component representations in the interface to internalized representations. A longer duration of Ô¨Åxation can indicate difÔ¨Åculty in extracting information, but it can also mean that the object is more engaging in some way (Scialfa and Joffe, 1998; Just and Carpenter, 1976). (3) Saccade Amplitude: In a study of computer display interface design, Goldberg found that larger saccadic amplitudes and fewer interim Ô¨Åxations indicated that users scanned to desired targets more effectively. Another useful indicator is the Ô¨Årst saccade amplitude to region of interest. A larger saccade amplitude indicates that the user‚Äôs attention is drawn from a distance to the target (Goldberg et al., 2002) or an anticipatory response is initiated with a saccade (Cirilli et al., 2011). Besides these factors, other factors have also been discussed in the literature. Maximum and average Ô¨Åxation times are context- independent measures, but the duration of single Ô¨Åxations on tar- gets is dependent on the layout of the stimulus target. Thus, the number of Ô¨Åxations per region of interest has also been used. For  example, a high number of Ô¨Åxations on a particular region indicates that it is more noticeable, or more important, to the viewer than other regions (Poole et al., 2004). Blink rate can be used as an index of cognitive workload. A higher blink rate may indicate fatigue (Yagi et al., 2009; Bruneau et al., 2002). Although much research has focused on attractive targets, little research has studied the detec- tion of unattractive targets by the visual system. In the Ô¨Åeld of military camouÔ¨Çage design, traditional psychophysical factors such as detection time and hit rates are used to assess the performance of camouÔ¨Çage. Past research on target attraction showed that when distracters are similar to targets (Neider and Zelinsky, 2006), it is insufÔ¨Åcient to analyze only increases in Ô¨Åxation time, and one should not ignore other characteristics that inÔ¨Çuence the result. Fixations, saccades, or other information on eye movement can allow researchers to identify such characteristics (Havermann et al., 2012; Unema et al., 2005; Phillips, 1981; Noyes, 1980). In this study, we applied a camouÔ¨Çage target detection experiment to assess different kinds of camouÔ¨Çage on different battleÔ¨Åelds, using an eye tracker. In this paper, all the results are analyzed, and those factors that provide better assessment of camouÔ¨Çage performance are identiÔ¨Åed.  2. "
s0003687013001956,"  The study of interruptions in the domain of healthcare is rela- tively new, as compared to other domains such as aviation and driving. However, recently, the topic of interruptions has been heavily pursued by healthcare researchers (Coiera, 2012). This new interest is in part due to the Institute of Medicine‚Äôs (2000) report which highlighted interruptions as likely contributors to medical errors. Unfortunately, the healthcare research to date has been quite homogenous in nature (Coiera, 2012; Rivera-Rodriguez and Karsh, 2010). The main focus has only been on the healthcare provider (HCP) being interrupted (i.e. the interruptee) and their experiences with and reactions to interruptions (Biron et al., 2009). This one-sided perspective on interruptions is a concern for several reasons. First, it does not capture the dual (interruptereinter- ruptee) complexities that Rivera-Rodriguez and Karsh (2010) identiÔ¨Åed when they depicted the varying outcomes (positivee positive, positiveenegative, neutralenegative, etc) that the inter- ruptee and interrupter can experience from any given interruption. Second, it tends to highlight the micro-cognitive elements related to interruptions (i.e., effects on the interruptee), while ignoring the socio-technical system implications that interruptions can have on the system (e.g., interruptions emerging from teamwork) (Rivera-  * Tel.: √æ1 864 656 3114. E-mail address: Rodrig7@clemson.edu.  0003-6870/$ e see front matter Published by Elsevier Ltd. http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2013.08.009  Rodriguez and Karsh, 2010). Third, this approach only studies in- terruptions after they have already occurred. All of these limitations have cultivated insufÔ¨Åcient interruption interventions which have focused on eliminating or reducing all interruptions (Anthony et al., 2010; Pape, 2003; Pape et al., 2005; Peleg et al., 2000; Relihan et al., 2009). These intervention strategies (e.g. orange vests to signify ‚Äúinterruption-free‚Äù zones) are troublesome because they do not Ô¨Åt with the workÔ¨Çow of the system (Karsh et al., 2006), many times resulting in non-value added interruptions themselves (e.g., putting on and taking off the vests). However, many interruptions are actually necessary (e.g. nurses calling another HCP when they need immediate help with their patient, patient monitors and intravenous pumps alarming to indicate a change in the patient‚Äôs status). Researchers studying interruptions and developing inter- ruption interventions in healthcare need to better understand the nuances that exist with interruptions in such complex systems (Rivera-Rodriguez and Karsh, 2010).  1.1.  Socio-technical systems approach to studying interruptions  From a complex socio-technical systems perspective, in- terruptions can be thought of as one way in which two systems (made of inputs, transformations, and outputs) interact with one another (see Fig. 1) (Donabedian, 1979). With interruptions, one system (i.e. the interrupter) produces the interruption as an output and the other system (i.e. the interruptee) receives the interruption as an input (Rivera and Karsh, 2008). Past research has extensively  
748  A .J. Rivera / Applied Ergonomics 45 (2014) 747e756  Fig. 1. Dual complexities of  interruptions.  examined the latter system, only providing us with ex post facto information on interruptions. Little is known about the former system, the system that triggers the interruption process. There- fore, this study takes a Ô¨Årst-of-its-kind look at interruptions by studying interruptions from the interrupter‚Äôs point-of-view. Studying this system (i.e. the interrupting agent) will allow us to understand interruptions from a completely different perspecti- vedone that tries to understand the situation prior to an inter- ruption occurring by understanding the cognitive processes (e.g., perceiving and assessing) underlying the decision to interrupt. This approach will facilitate our understanding of the dual-complexities and socio-technical inÔ¨Çuences of interruptions. This new under- standing can help researchers develop interventions that are more compatible with HCPs‚Äô workÔ¨Çow and more beneÔ¨Åcial to patient safety because they will be able to target non-value added in- terruptions for elimination while still facilitating value-added interruptions.  1.2.  Purpose of study  In this study, an interruption was deÔ¨Åned as an unplanned break in workÔ¨Çow caused by an external source (i.e. the interrupter). This deÔ¨Ånition is deliberately broad to encompass many of the deÔ¨Åni- tions other researchers have used for interruptions (e.g., Coiera and  Table 1 Study setting and population demographics.

Tombs, 1998; Flynn et al., 1999; Pape, 2003) and distractions (e.g., Healey et al., 2007), disruptions (e.g., Wiegmann et al., 2007), breaks-in-task (e.g., Chisholm et al., 2000), etc. Interruptibility (see research questions below) can be thought of as a combination of 1) how interruptible someone is based on the interruption‚Äôs potential impact on their task performance, which takes into consideration their cognitive and social state; and 2) how interruptible someone is based on a conscious choice of their willingness to be interrupted (Grandhi and Jones, 2009). This study, being the Ô¨Årst to examine interruptions in this way, took an exploratory approach, to answer the following research questions (RQs):   RQ 1: How do  nurses  determine  the  interruptibility  of  other  nurses?  RQ 2: Which interruptions are perceived as warranted even if a nurse‚Äôs interruptibility is determined to be low?  RQ 3: How do nurses interrupt other nurses?  2. Method  All procedures were approved by the Hospital‚Äôs and University‚Äôs Institutional Review Boards.  2.1.  Study setting  This study was conducted in a Neuroscience Surgical Intensive Care Unit (NSICU) at a non-proÔ¨Åt, 440-bed tertiary care hospital in the Midwest of the United States. With 1100 staff nurses, this hospital offers both inpatient and outpatient treatment and diag- nostic services. An ICU within a hospital setting was purposively sampled over other healthcare settings (e.g., primary care, phar- macy) because interruptions occur more often in hospitals (Chisholm et al., 2001) and in ICUs (Alvarez and Coiera, 2005; Anthony et al., 2010). Table 1 shows the demographical statistics of the study unit and population.  2.2.  Participants  Nurses within a critical care setting were purposefully selected as the healthcare provider of interest for this study. The focus was on the nurse-to-nurse dyad, concentrating on the interrupting nurse. Past research has highlighted that not only are nurses frequently interrupted (e.g., 16.7 interruptions per hour (Alvarez and Coiera, 2005)), but they are also cited as sources of in- terruptions (e.g., Friedman et al., 2005; Hedberg and Larsson, 2004; Kreckler et al., 2008). Furthermore, Brixey et al. (2008) and Edwards et al. (2009) revealed what a signiÔ¨Åcant role nurses in hospital settings play as contributors of interruptions over other healthcare providers. They found that nurses initiated 36.16% (Brixey et al., 2008) and 41.50% (Edwards et al., 2009) of the observed interruptions. Although interruptions are events that typically occur in hos- pital settings, they are not considered a part of the typical nursing work taught in school and nurse training. Therefore, the knowledge that is required to deal with interruptions is not covered in formalized procedures, but rather it is tacit knowledge that is developed over time and with experience (Klein et al., 1989). To target the tacit knowledge used to interrupt, and to reduce vari- ability and increase methodological control, expert nurses were purposively sampled. This also means that all the results of this study are framed from the expert nurse‚Äôs perspective. According to how Benner‚Äôs (1982) study applied the Dreyfus Model of proÔ¨Å- ciency to nursing work, expert nurses for this study were deÔ¨Åned as nurses with more than 3 years of experience on the NSICU.

Based on their reviews, they gave written feedback to the author which consisted of com- ments/questions regarding the codes. The author reviewed the feedback and modiÔ¨Åed the codes if necessary. For example, some chunks of data were split into different codes or were double coded based on the external feedback obtained.  The author conducted 15 h and 47 min of observations shad- owing Ô¨Åve unique nurses sampled randomly throughout both day and night shifts. The author followed nurses while they worked and recorded the tasks they completed by hand in a notebook. An observation lasted between 2 and 4 h. Observations helped the author become familiar with this particular ICU, its layout, the nurses‚Äô workÔ¨Çow, the nurses‚Äô vocabulary, and the way nurses interrupted other nurses. Observations also helped the author better understand references nurses‚Äô made about their work during the interviews. Using what was learned from observations, the author con- ducted 10 interviews with nurses, ranging between 20 and 45 min. Interviews began with an open-ended question (How do you decide whether you should interrupt another nurse?) allowing participants to describe their experiences with interruptions, their work environment with regards to interruptions, and the decisions they make about interrupting. Multiple probes (some modiÔ¨Åed from Klein et al.‚Äôs (1989) Critical Decision Method to elicit tacit knowledge) were used to uncover: 1) the context surrounding in- terruptions, 2) contributing factors to interrupting, 3) the different ways nurses interrupt one another, and 4) the potential conse- quences of interrupting. Each interview was audio-recorded and then transcribed by an external transcriptionist.  2.4. Data analysis  Dimensional analysis was used to guide the analysis of the interview data. Dimensional analysis is an analytic method derived from grounded theory (Schatzman, 1991). It is an inductive analytical method that builds on natural analysis (i.e. a normative cognitive process used to interpret meaning from the data) and symbolic interactionism (i.e. the notion that reality is socially constructed and people behave according to their understanding of the situation) to understand and describe human experiences or phenomena that have not been well studied within its social  Fig. 2.

The data analysis was conducted by the author using NVivo9√ì (QSR International Pty Ltd., Melbourne Australia). The data analysis process started by highlighting chunks of data (dimensionalizing) that could be labeled using one descriptive phrase or code (designating) (Kools et al., 1996; Kramer et al., 2006). This process was repeated until the major aspects of nurses‚Äô experiences with interruptions appeared to be covered, representing a ‚Äúcritical mass‚Äù of dimensions. Once a ‚Äúcritical mass‚Äù was obtained the dimensions were categorized into higher-level dimensions (Kools et al., 1996; Kramer et al., 2006). Then these high-level dimensions were coded into the conceptual categories of dimensional analysis that result in an explanatory matrix of the results: Context: the situation or environment in which the phe- nomenon is studied; Conditions: dimensions that facilitate or block actions or processes related to the phenomenon; Processes: inten- ded or unintended actions shaped by the conditions; and Conse- quences: outcomes of the processes of the phenomenon (Kools et al., 1996). Table 2 highlights the strategies that were used to ensure data collection and analytical rigor.  2.4.1.  Interpreting the explanatory matrix  Within the explanatory matrix (Fig. 2), the conceptual category of context provides a description of the study unit characteristics that affect the way nurses communicate and work together, which inÔ¨Çuences when and how nurses interrupt each other. All the other conceptual categories are bounded by this context. The conceptual category of conditions and consequences provides the answer to RQ 1 and 2; and the conceptual category of processes answers RQ 3.  3. Results  Prior to discussing the main results (i.e., answers to RQ 1e3), it is Ô¨Årst necessary to highlight how the uniqueness of the NSICU and critical care nursing work inÔ¨Çuences nurses‚Äô experiences with in- terruptions. The context or environment in which nurses work provides a structure for the inputs that feed the interrupting system (i.e., the interrupting nurse). During the interviews, nurses dis- cussed Ô¨Åve general themes that exempliÔ¨Åed their context of work; each will be discussed below.  3.1. NSICU context  3.1.1.  Size of unit  The NSICU is a relatively small unit. As shown in Table 1, it consists of 28 nurses and only eight patient beds which run on average at an 88% occupancy rate. The patient rooms are geographically collocated and arranged in a ‚ÄúU‚Äù shape with the nursing station and medication room in the center of the ‚ÄúU‚Äù. Nurses feel that this arrangement affords them the opportunity to have frequent face-to-face communication with all hospital staff.  3.1.2. Nature of critical care settings  According to the nurse participants and validated by the litera- ture, critical care settings tend to be much more dynamic and fast- paced than acute care units. Critical care units also have patient populations that are very ill and have complex conditions. These two factors create a unique pattern of communication where nurses must interrupt each other to solve clinical issues related to patient care. For example, one nurse said: ‚ÄúI think a lot of times I dismiss the  interruptions as just part of being in like a critical care setting where things are changing so rapidly, we have very sick patients that, you know, it‚Äôs for the patient‚Äôs beneÔ¨Åt I think that we‚Äôre often interrupting each other that, um, I think I just kind of assume that that‚Äôs why we do what we do is because of the setting that we‚Äôre in.‚Äù  3.1.3.  Characteristics of nursing work on unit  NSICU nurses all follow a general nursing practice pattern. Nurses try to block off chunks of time to spend in their patient‚Äôs room to complete all their direct patient care tasks, then most nurses perform indirect patient care tasks and their documentation responsibilities at the nursing station. Working in teams is another important part of nursing work in the NSICU. Nurses rely on each other to help them with both routine tasks such as lifting a patient and non-routine tasks such as helping with a patient emergency. Depending on the nurses‚Äô training, they may have different practicing styles which can lead some nurses to need more help than others. Although working in teams helps nurses complete their daily tasks, it also creates an environment rich with interruptions.  3.1.4.  Communication norms of unit  The NSICU nurses do not use phones or other locating devices to communicate with one another. Most of their communication is conducted synchronously (i.e. face-to-face), which they prefer over asynchronous communication (e.g., pagers).  3.1.5. Differences in characteristics of nurses per work shift  As seen in Table 1, the NSICU has three different working shifts; however due to stafÔ¨Ång assignments, the three shifts can be dichotomized into two shifts: Day and Night, where the Night shift also includes the PM shift. There are some clear differences be- tween nurses working the day and night shift. Less experienced, younger nurses generally work the night shift rather than the day shift because the night shift positions tend to open up more often and are Ô¨Ålled by new hires. Due to this less experienced, younger set of nurses all working together on the night shift, nurses tend to be more comfortable with interrupting one another to ask each other questions. One nurse explained it like this: ‚ÄúI work , well, the  evening through night shift and a lot of the nurses are younger so I think it's kind of raised an atmosphere of it's okay to ask questions and it's encouraged to ask questions if you‚Äôre not 100% sure about some- thing or you need some backup.But, you know, I have worked.on other shifts when there‚Äôs people there that I would not prefer to seek help from or interrupt something that they‚Äôre doing. But I would say on the shift that I work , I feel comfortable asking just about anybody.‚Äù  This comfort level is also inÔ¨Çuenced by differences in relationships that nurses have with one another on each shift. Night shift nurses share a different camaraderie than day shift nurses. As this quote illustrates night shift nurses tend to have relationships with each other outside of work, while day shift nurses tend to only have professional relationships with each other: ‚ÄúNights and PM seem like  there‚Äôs more of a, I don‚Äôt want to say friends, but they seem a little bit more close, closer.. Like days, I think , the older people, the people who have been here for a while, they have their own families. They [the day shift nurses] don‚Äôt do stuff together outside of work .‚Äù Due to both  these factors (i.e., similar age group and closer relationships), night shift nurses tend to be more comfortable with interrupting one another to ask each other questions.  3.2. How do nurses determine the interruptibility of other nurses? (RQ1)  Although interruptions are but a moment in time, this study found that prior to that moment, nurses most often conduct a quick, but extensive cost-beneÔ¨Åt assessment to determine the interruptibility of another nurse and decide whether to interrupt, delay interrupting, or not interrupt at all. To complete such an assessment, nurses consider: 1) several conditional factors related to the interruptee, 2) conditional factors related to the interrupter, 3) the nature of the interruption content, and 4) potential

Additionally, these factors seem to be weighted differently depending on the interrupter, the interrupter‚Äôs role, the in- terrupter‚Äôs work shift, etc.  3.2.1.  Interruptee‚Äôs approachability  Perceptions of approachability are determined by: 1) How comfortable the interrupter feels with the interruptee, where comfort was described as being based on the personality of the interruptee and how well the nurses got along with each other; and 2) The interruptee‚Äôs previous reactions to being interrupted. Nurses are less likely to interrupt another nurse if they do not feel comfortable with that nurse or if that nurse had reacted negatively to previous interruptions.  3.2.2.  Interruptee‚Äôs projected sense of ‚Äúbusyness‚Äù  Nurses get to know each other and the way they practice care, which helps them judge whether it is an acceptable time to inter- rupt. They use cues such as the interruptee‚Äôs movement around the unit, their body language, facial expressions, demeanor, and listen to their tone of voice to determine if that nurse is too busy and should not be interrupted. One nurse explained it like this: ‚ÄúTheir  demeanor, basically their body language. Some nurses, you can tell by how they‚Äôre scurrying around the unit, that‚Äôs not a person I‚Äôm going to interrupt, because they are extremely busy. Maybe they have a heavy patient load.‚Äù  3.2.3.  Interruptee‚Äôs role on unit  Nurses‚Äô perception of interruptibility is inÔ¨Çuenced by the interruptee‚Äôs role on the unit. The charge nurse is seen as more interruptible than bedside nurses because in the NSICU the charge nurse is not responsible for patients. Instead, the charge nurse manages the dynamics of the unit and is responsible for helping bedside nurses manage their workload. The charge nurse‚Äôs role is to help others and to be a constant resource for other nurses on the unit. Nurses will often look to interrupt a charge nurse Ô¨Årst, prior to another bedside nurse, or if they can, they will wait to interrupt until the charge nurse is available. One nurse who also rotates as a charge nurse put it like this: ‚ÄúI  think that, um, the majority of the time, the charge nurse is there as a resource, especially if there‚Äôs less experienced nurses, somebody that is there to offer help, someone that  is there because they have more experience that they should be able to, you know, be interrupted depending on what they‚Äôre doing. They don‚Äôt have the speciÔ¨Åc tasks that a bedside nurse would do, to ask them to do something for you or to help you with something, I think that that‚Äôs kind of primarily, the way that I act as a charge nurse is being helpful to others, being a resource for others, there as an option if people need to seek someone to help them with something.‚Äù  3.2.4.  Interruptee‚Äôs task  Nurses use the interruptee‚Äôs actions and location as cues to determine what the interruptee is doing and if he/she is inter- ruptible. Table 3 lists certain tasks nurses consider more or less acceptable to interrupt. Note, these tasks are not mutually exclu- siveddepending on the nurse or the nature of the interruption content, some tasks are considered as both more and less accept- able to interrupt. However, in general direct patient care tasks are seen as less interruptible than indirect patient care tasks. For that reason, nurses tend to interrupt each other more often at the nursing desk where charting is the main task, rather than at the bedside where nurses interact with patients and their families and administer medications. The following quotes describe nurses‚Äô decisions about interrupting other nurses at the nursing station versus the patient‚Äôs room (or bedside): Nurse A: ‚ÄúI think that a lot of  times at the desk people are just charting or are just watching the monitors and kind of, you know, a little bit more of a downtime kind of feeling sometimes. So I think that I‚Äôd have an easier time interrupting someone at the desk saying, hey, I, can you help me with this. And it‚Äôs right there when you come out of a room, you know, you can just open the door and say, hey, can someone help me with something versus seeking someone speciÔ¨Åc out in a room, going in there, and like I said you‚Äôre, they are in front of a patient for sure whether or not they [the patient] can understand what‚Äôs going on, but there may be family in the room, that kind of thing. So try to avoid that, you know, if there‚Äôs someone at the desk that you can [get] help from.‚Äù Nurse B: ‚ÄúSo if they‚Äôre involved in speciÔ¨Åc patient care that‚Äôs, if I would see it as non- interruptible, then I wouldn‚Äôt interrupt. Um, then I would go to the next person that looked like they were interruptible, not busy, not at the bedside, um, pretty much trying not to get somebody that‚Äôs at the bedside.‚Äù  Lastly, besides visual cues, nurses will use auditory cues to interrupt conversations. If necessary, nurses will brieÔ¨Çy listen into conversations to determine whether they are work-related or non- work related discussions, and interrupt the non-work related conversations. Regardless of conversation topic, nurses tend to interrupt nurse-to-nurse conversations more often than nurse-to- doctor conversations, for two reasons: 1) Nurses interrupt nurse- to-nurse conversations (even if it is work-related) to offer their expert advice or opinion; and 2) Nurses know doctors are busy so when they are on the unit the conversation is likely about a patient and important.  3.2.5.  Interrupter‚Äôs level of situation awareness  Nurse‚Äôs level of situation awareness (SA) about their environ- ment, the unit dynamics, and other nurse‚Äôs patient load or work- load, can facilitate or hinder their ability to determine a nurse‚Äôs interuptibility. Nurses use proactive or ‚Äúin-the-moment‚Äù tech- niques to increase their SA. Proactively, nurses increase their SA by taking notes at the beginning of their shift about patient-nurse assignments, patient criticality, patient transfers, or by using prior knowledge, knowing that during certain times throughout a shift, nurses tend to complete certain tasks. In-the-moment, nurses in- crease their SA by peeking behind a closed curtain to see what the nurse is doing before interrupting rather than interrupting through the closed curtain. The former methods are most preferred to reduce non-value added interruptions.  
752  A .J. Rivera / Applied Ergonomics 45 (2014) 747e756  3.2.6. Interrupter‚Äôs prior experience in nursing and with interruptions  Experience inÔ¨Çuences nurses interrupting patterns. Experi- enced nurses tend to need less help, reducing the need to interrupt to ask questions, however, they may be more likely to interrupt to offer their opinion or to give a suggestion to more novice nurses. Based on the nurses descriptions of how they interrupted as novice nurses versus how they interrupt now, it appears that experienced nurses tend to interrupt at more appropriate times because they are able to shift their work and complete other tasks until they see it is a better time to interrupt. While novice nurses interrupt more frequently and more immediately to ask questions because they are less conÔ¨Ådent and less Ô¨Çexible in their workÔ¨Çow. Lastly, expert nurses use their own experiences (e.g., likes and dislikes) with being interrupted to determine when and how to interrupt others. One nurse described the evolution of her interrupting pattern like  this: ‚ÄúI think I am more conÔ¨Ådent at this point that I would probably only interrupt someone if I knew that I needed help with something versus when I Ô¨Årst started, I was probably a lot more insecure about the decisions that I was making and I needed a lot more conÔ¨Årmation from other people.‚Äù  3.2.7.  Interrupter‚Äôs task  The tasks that nurses need to complete sometimes increase the probability of them interrupting other nurses. For example, there are certain tasks that per protocol require two people to com- pletedco-signing certain medication orders, witnessing wasting of certain medications, and repositioning the patient. Other tasks that increase the likelihood of interruptions are: Ô¨Åelding phone calls and medications delivered to the unit, and helping nurses with their patient load.  3.2.8. Nature of  interruption content  The nature of the interruption content plays a major role in the cost-beneÔ¨Åt assessment nurses conduct to determine interrupti- bility. Nurses interrupt based on the importance, the time- sensitivity, and the urgency of the interruption content, where urgency is a combination of importance and time-sensitivity.  3.2.9.  Patient consequences  In critical care, speciÔ¨Åcally in the NSICU many patients are either unconscious or sleeping the majority of the time. However, depending on patients‚Äô conditions or statuses some can be more alert than others. Nurses feel that patients who are more alert, can become bothered by interruptions if their nurse keeps getting interrupted while in the patient‚Äôs room. One nurse explained it like  this: ‚ÄúIf [interrupting is] done frequently with patient care, I know the patients get frustrated. And sometimes it just can‚Äôt be helped, your other patient is really sick .‚Äù  3.2.10.  Interruptee consequences  Nurses discussed several negative outcomes that interruptee nurses can experience when they are interrupted. Interruptions can affect an interruptee‚Äôs concentration on the primary task, they can contribute to an interruptee forgetting what they were doing when interrupted, and they can increase the likelihood of an interruptee making a general error, a medication error, or a documentation error. One nurse discussed her experiences with interruptions that highlighted some of the negative consequences:  interrupt giving meds, because then you lose all hard and you‚Äôre more prone to make a mistake.‚Äù  ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt like to track and then it‚Äôs  nurses. Occasionally some nurses feel frustrated, annoyed, or both- ered by being interrupted. One nurse explained like this: ‚ÄúI know  there‚Äôs days where, just the other day, it seemed like I, I get done at 3:30, and it was 4:00 o‚Äôclock and I was just trying to write a note and I had one person try to talk to me here, one person trying to talk to me here, the phone ringing for me, it just gets frustrating.‚Äù  That being said, not all interruptions from the interruptee‚Äôs perspective are negative. There are times when interruptions can elicit positive/neutral emotional responses from an interruptee nurse. Some nurses are even enthusiastic to attend to an inter- ruption if it means helping a fellow nurse. For example, one nurse explained interruptees‚Äô reactions to interruptions like this: ‚ÄúI mean,  there are some people who are like super enthusiastic to help out‚Äù  while another nurse explained terruptions like this: ‚ÄúMost of  the nurses on this Ô¨Çoor do very well with being interrupted. They don‚Äôt get, I guess you‚Äôd say, bent out of shape.‚Äù  interruptees‚Äô  reactions  to  in-  3.2.11.  Interrupter consequences  Nurses identiÔ¨Åed three important positive outcomes of in- terruptions related to the interrupter. Nurses feel that interruptions allow them to transfer needed information to one another in a timely manner. Nurses feel that because they communicate most often through interruptions, that interruptions often increase the timeliness of patient care. Also, along those same lines, nurses feel that overall, interruptions enhance their ability to problem solve. In general, interruptions facilitate teamwork by improving the in- terrupters‚Äô ability to provide safe and quality care to their patients. In fact, when asked if they could complete their job without interrupting other nurses, nurses said it would be impossible or nearly impossible.  3.3. Which interruptions are perceived as warranted even if a nurse‚Äôs interruptibility is determined to be low? (RQ 2)  Although most interruptions are contingent on a multitude of factors, there were only two types that were always seen as war- ranted even if a nurse‚Äôs interruptibility was judged as low. Not surprising, an interruption due to a patient-related emergency supersedes any primary task, conditional factor, or potential consequence. Regarding patient-related emergency interruptions,  two nurses said this: Nurse A: ‚ÄúIt depends on the situation, you know. If I had someone that, you know, was obviously dying or coding, I wouldn‚Äôt care what the next person was doing. I would interrupt because I needed help.‚Äù Nurse B: ‚ÄúIf I had an emergency with a patient, I wouldn‚Äôt, I would just yell. I wouldn‚Äôt care who I interrupted.‚Äù  More surprising, was the fact that all the nurses stated they would always interrupt to notify other nurses that the doctor is on the phone, no matter what the doctor is calling for and no matter what the nurse is doing. One nurse said it simply: ‚ÄúIf a physician  needs to talk to you, that, you know, pretty much regardless of what, uh, how important that phone call is, you just get the nurse.‚Äù Nurses  stated two main reasons for this warranted interruption: 1) doctors are busy and time with them is valuable, and 2) if a doctor is calling the unit, it likely means that he/she is returning a call or page from the nurse, therefore the interrupter sees this as the nurse ‚Äúrequesting‚Äù the interruption.  3.4. How do nurses interrupt other nurses? (RQ 3)  Beyond the impact on attentional resources, the nurses discussed how interruptions can increase nurses‚Äô workload by extending the time required to complete tasks or by adding new tasks to their work plan. This elicits negative emotional responses from some  After the nurse decides to interrupt, they generally interrupt in one of Ô¨Åve ways. These methods were discussed in the interview and validated by the observations conducted. Table 4 describes the different methods nurses use to interrupt one another.  
A .J. Rivera / Applied Ergonomics 45 (2014) 747e756  753  Table 4 Processes of interrupting.  Method of interrupting  Description/example  Nurses‚Äô quotes  Non-targeted gesture to signal interruption  Non-targeted verbal interruption.  Targeted, face-to-face, verbal interruption.  Targeted, verbal  indirect, interruption.  Targeted gesture to signal interruption  A non-targeted gesture to signal an interruption is used when a nurse uses non-verbal actions to interrupt anyone on unit. Example: Nurses turn on a patient‚Äôs call light to signal that they need help in their patient‚Äôs room. The call light turns on outside the patient‚Äôs room and a general alarm beeps in the nursing station. Anyone that notices the light or hears the alarm may potentially be interrupted. Non-targeted verbal interruptions occur when nurses use verbal communication to interrupt anyone on the unit. Nurses tend to use this method most often when they need help with their patient and quickly. Nurses‚Äô tone of voice or the statement they use (e.g., ‚Äúcode blue‚Äù) when interrupting may provide the potential interruptee with needed information of how important, time-sensitive, or urgent the interruption is. Example: Nurses will yell out for help from their patient‚Äôs room because their patient falls.  Targeted, face-to-face, verbal interruptions are completed when nurses target a speciÔ¨Åc nurse to interrupt and then interrupt via a face-to-face, verbal interaction. This is the most common method used for interrupting. Example: Nurses seek out a particular nurse and interrupt them by providing them information or asking them a question. Targeted, indirect, verbal interruptions are conducted when nurses target a speciÔ¨Åc nurse to interrupt and then interrupt using verbal communication that is not face-to-face. With this type of interruption, nurses have lower SA and are unable to accurately assess the interruptibility of the interruptee prior to interruption. Example: Nurse interrupts and starts talking to another nurse through the curtain of the patient‚Äôs room. A targeted gesture to signal an interruption is a method used when a nurse targets a speciÔ¨Åc nurse to interrupt and then signals an interruption through a non-verbal action. Example: Nurse knocks on door to get the interruptee‚Äôs attention and then proceeds with the interruption, or a nurse stands and waits near a nurse or at the patient‚Äôs room doorway until the interruptee notices.  ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre stuck in a room and you can‚Äôt leave,  if you‚Äôre  holding pressure on bleeding or something, you know,  someone will hit the call light just to get some backup help.  Because then you could be, very much could be interrupting  whatever they‚Äôre doing. You don‚Äôt even know.‚Äù  ‚ÄúIf  I had someone that, you know, was obviously dying or  coding, I wouldn‚Äôt care what the next person was doing. I would interrupt because I needed help. I would just shout,  I need help, and hopefully, someone would decide they  could leave what they were doing.‚Äù  ‚ÄúSometimes you'll just yell out I need a turn, and then that's  usually whenever anybody's available. So you're  interrupting, but you're just kind of yelling it out there so anybody can come. [but] you don't know what you're  interrupting‚Äù  ‚ÄúOh, my heavens, it‚Äôs pretty much everything. Every communication is based on that..95% of our conversations  are based on interruption.‚Äù  ‚Äú[You] just call their name out, and say.hey, are you in  here [patient‚Äôs room]. Doing okay?‚Äù  ‚ÄúSometimes I‚Äôll  just wait, come up by somebody if they‚Äôre  like on the computer, and I‚Äôll just, you know, wait, and wait  for them to acknowledge me. And, you know, kind of  interrupt by not interrupting.‚Äù  4. Discussion  This study aimed to understand the system that generates the interruption process (i.e., the interrupting nurse). This study‚Äôs perspective is innovative, yielding new information about in- terruptions and nurses‚Äô decision making processes about inter- rupting. By taking a socio-technical systems approach, the results complement the dual-complexity paradigm presented in Rivera- Rodriguez and Karsh (2010) and provides evidence that although interruptions are just an instant in time, they are much more complex than what previous literature has been depicting them as.  4.1. Attributes of critical care that foster interruptions  Researchers studying interruptions in hospitals and speciÔ¨Åcally ICUs have shown that interruptions occur frequently in critical care environments (Alvarez and Coiera, 2005; Anthony et al., 2010; Drews, 2007). One of the reasons why interruptions may occur so often in critical care is because of the dynamic, fast-paced nature of the environment. However, beyond this hectic environment there are other attributes that may increase the likelihood of interruptions. The structure of the NSICU, the characteristics of critical nursing work, and the criticality of ICU patients all foster an atmosphere of frequent interruptions, so much so, that nurses consider in- terruptions as part of their job. First, whether intentional or not, the NSICU‚Äôs layout is designed to promote collaboration and teamwork between nursesdthe NSICU is small, the layout of the patient rooms is condense, and the nursing station is centrally located. It is much easier for nurses to talk to one another face-to-face (creating in- terruptions) on a unit structured like the NSICU than on a larger unit  where patient rooms are located further away from one another and the nursing station is not in the center. Second, critical care nurses in the NSICU and in general complete lots of task switching between patients. Although nurses prefer to ‚Äúchunk‚Äù their work by patient and direct versus indirect care tasks, many times, due to the criti- cality of their patients, nurses must switch between patients mid- assessment or mid-task especially if one of their patients is deteri- orating. This working pattern may require nurses to travel into the halls and near the nursing station much more often than nurses in acute care settings. Wolf et al. (2006) found that nurses who ventured out into the halls, as opposed to those who stayed in their patient‚Äôs room, incurred many more interruptions. This is probably due to the fact that nurses seem more available when in the hall than when in a patient‚Äôs room. Additionally, while nurses venture out into the halls it is much more likely that they may interrupt nurses at the nursing station due to their proximity to those nurses. It seems that the travel patterns of critical care nurses affords them the opportunity to interrupt more easily than nurses on other units who may stay in their patient‚Äôs room for longer periods of time; however, more research is needed to conÔ¨Årm this. Lastly, nurses emphasized that critical care patients, tend to have much more complex and fast changing conditions than patients on other units; therefore, nurses rely on each other for clinical problem solving and for emergency help when needed. The way nurses solve problems and help each other with emergencies is through communication. Some problems, along with emergencies, need to be dealt with quickly; therefore, nurses do not have the luxury of waiting for when other nurses are not busy, rather they must interrupt to get help. Related, expert nurses can recognize problems as they begin and they will interrupt other nurses to proactively help problem solve and offer suggestions or their opinion.  
754  Table 5 Limitations.  Limitation:  1. Small sample size and study conducted in only one hospital unit.  2. Data collection and analysis was conducted by one researcher.  3. Interviewing is a retrospective method  Explanation:  Although this sample size and methodological control is appropriate for qualitative research it limits the generalizability of this study. That said, the focus was on transferability which means readers must judge for themselves if the Ô¨Åndings Ô¨Åt their settings and experiences (Malterud, 2001). To help with transferability, the author sought to provide a complete and detailed description of the study setting and context, and a comprehensive explanation of the Ô¨Åndings. This may have increased the consistency between interviews but reduced the validity of the coding process. To increase internal validity, a member checking focus group with nurses (N ¬º 5) was conducted and the coding structure was critically reviewed multiple times (N ¬º 6) by different researchers (N ¬º 5). This means that recall biases may have inÔ¨Çuenced the data collected. That said, interviews were conducted during nurse‚Äôs shift to reduce the time between the event in question (interrupting) and the questioning.  4.2.  Complexities of  interruptions  Within the context of critical care, this study examined the cognitive processes underlying nurses‚Äô decisions to interrupt other nurses. It is quite apparent that very often, prior to interrupting, nurses complete quick cost-beneÔ¨Åt assessments to determine whether another nurse is interruptible and the interruption is value-added versus non-value added. Nurses weigh cues they obtain from the environment, including information derived from assessing the interruptee‚Äôs circumstances, with their needs (i.e., their task and interruption content), and the potential conse- quences (positive or negative) to the patient, interruptee or themselves. Although there are exceptions (i.e., doctor phone calls), it seems that if the cost of not interrupting is high (e.g. patient crashing), nurses only consider the beneÔ¨Åts for themselves (and crashing patient) and not the conditions of or potential conse- quences to the interruptee or other patients. However, if that same cost is judged as bearable to the interrupter, but high for the nurse being interrupted, they may not interrupt, or they may try to interrupt in a ‚Äúless‚Äù intrusive manner. More research is needed to test these observations. However, the fact that nurses use different methods of interrupting is a new facet to interruptions, not covered in the current literature. Although past research has categorized the source of the interruption (pager, phone, person) (e.g., Friedman et al., 2005; Potter et al., 2004), it has not examined the method in which HCPs choose to interrupt each other. Nurses choose their method based on the task they are doing or need to do, the task the interruptee is doing, and the potential consequences. Most inter- esting is when nurses consider the interruptee‚Äôs tasks and potential consequences, as they are unknowingly taking into account the interruptee‚Äôs need to manage the interruption. For example, nurses sometimes choose to interrupt using a targeted gesture to signal an interruption over a targeted, face-to-face verbal or targeted, indi- rect verbal interruption to allow the interruptee time to mark their place so they are able to safely return to what they were doing after the interruption. Marking one‚Äôs place or having the opportunity to rehearse the primary task, reduces the chances of committing an error of omission or commission (Altmann and Trafton, 2004; Gillie and Broadbent, 1989). When possible, this method of interrupting  A .J. Rivera / Applied Ergonomics 45 (2014) 747e756  needs to be encouraged to provide interruptee‚Äôs the opportunity for interruption management which should indirectly increase patient safety.  4.3.  Interrupting to maintain safety and organizational resilience  Nurses‚Äô roles are multidimensional (Tucker and Spear, 2006). In hospital settings, the most common aspect of their role is providing direct care to patients. However, they are also responsible for care coordination between different healthcare providers and they must consistently deal with and recover from system failures in order to keep patients safe and the system functioning properly (Gurses and Carayon, 2007; Rivera-Rodriguez et al., 2012; Tucker, 2004; Tucker and Spear, 2006). At the individual level, nurses adapt to different situations and changes in patients‚Äô conditions; and through this process, in- terruptions emerge as a strategy to redeploy resources where needed to enhance organizational resilience (Hollnagel et al., 2006). This study, and others (e.g., Holden et al., 2012; Potter et al., 2004; Tucker and Spear, 2006; Wolf et al., 2006), provide evidence that nurses use interruptions to manage and recover from system failures such as inadequate training, unavailable resources, and technology breakdowns. Additionally, as stated above, nurses use interruptions to facilitate teamwork which helps support competing healthcare quality goals set by the Institute of Medicine (Institute of Medicine, 2001). For example, nurses must balance the goal of providing patient-centered care which focuses on the pa- tient‚Äôs needs and preferences, while simultaneously increasing ef- Ô¨Åciency by avoiding waste of equipment, supplies, energy, etc. (Hollnagel et al., 2006; Institute of Medicine, 2001). Unlike other methods of adapting and problem solving where clinical judgment, taught in an academic or training environment, is used, the process of interrupting always involves another person and is a self-taught skill developed through on-the-job, hands-on experiences. Therefore, similar to the concept of workarounds (Halbesleben et al., 2010), interrupting can be both necessary and an inherent system vulnerability. Performing the interrupting process at appropriate times (i.e. when the interruptee‚Äôs inter- ruptibility is high) facilitates the joint optimization of system safety and resilience. However, when the timing of the interruption is not ideal, which is often the case during emergency situations, one or more parts of the system move towards the system‚Äôs boundary of acceptable limits, reducing the margin of error, and increasing the system‚Äôs brittleness and the risk to patient safety (Cook and Rasmussen, 2005; Hollnagel et al., 2006). This only raises the importance of examining interruptions from a socio-technical perspective, to understand all of the system factors that inÔ¨Çuence how and why nurses interrupt each other, in order to design more compatible interruption interventions and better interruption management training for nurses.  5.  Limitations  Table 5 lists the main limitations of this study, many of which can be attended to with an expanded, follow-up, study.  6.  Conclusion  This study highlighted four new phenomena related to nurses‚Äô decision making about interruptions. First, nurses‚Äô decisions about interruptions are bounded and constrained by the context in which they work. The NSICU is structured in a way that facilitates team- work and face-to-face communication; additionally, nurses do not have cell phones or a paging system both of which would in- Ô¨Çuence how they interrupt one another. Second, to determine  
A .J. Rivera / Applied Ergonomics 45 (2014) 747e756  755  interruptibility, nurses conduct a cost-beneÔ¨Åt assessment to distin- guish value-added interruptions from non-valued added in- terruptions when deciding whether to interrupt. This underscores two important points for future research and interventions: 1) nurses need to be provided the necessary tools and training so they are able to appropriately assess the costs and beneÔ¨Åts prior to interrupting; and 2) in order to design interventions that eliminate non-value added interruptions and facilitate value-added ones, it must be understood that the deÔ¨Ånition of value-added and non- value added interruptions is, in part, context (and person) depen- dent. This means that not all interventions are created equal across units, hospitals, and healthcare settings, and researcher must be careful of contextual fallacies. Third, when discussing consequences it must be noted that nurses provided evidence for the assertions made in Rivera-Rodriguez and Karsh (2010), that not all in- terruptions are bad. Nurses reported many positive consequences that can result from interruptions. Lastly, this study reported that nurses use Ô¨Åve different methods for interrupting, one of which facilitates interruption management by the interruptee. Due to the difÔ¨Åculty of deÔ¨Åning value-added and non-value added in- terruptions, providing this interruption management opportunity, along with training interrupters to properly assess the situation prior to interrupting might be more advantageous than inappro- priately designed interventions.

s0003687013002020,"  The application in recent years of motorcycle simulators to study motorcycle riding skills (e.g., Crundall et al., 2012; Crundall et al., 2013; Di Stasi et al., 2009; Di Stasi et al., 2011; Hosking et al., 2010; Liu et al., 2009; Shahar et al., 2010) has the potential to contribute to the development of rider skill and safety. Although low Ô¨Ådelity driving simulators can be effective tools for assessing various issues, simulators that do not incorporate motion capabilities are more limited and their use to study certain matters may well be inappropriate. Vestibular and somatosensory motion cues have a beneÔ¨Åcial effect on driver behavior in senso- rimotor tasks such as braking (e.g., Malaterre and Fr√©chaux, 2001) and lateral trajectory control (McLane and Wierwille, 1975). When riding a motorcycle however, roll is actually being used to control trajectory. Indeed, researchers in the area of motorcycle safety are motivated to develop motion-based motorcycle simulators and to apply them toward studying motorcycling performance, especially in tasks such as curve negotiation, where the use of static simula- tors seems to be less appropriate (e.g., Crundall et al., 2012).  * Corresponding author.

However, the beneÔ¨Åts of motion cues might be outweighed by adverse effects if false forces and cues are generated, or when poor coupling between inertial and visual cues is achieved (Pinto et al., 2008). Studies looking into the coupling between visual and iner- tial cues typically aim to characterize the proportions between the movements of the base of the simulator and of the visual scene. Such investigation has been undertaken in the context of Ô¨Çight simulation for angular movements (e.g., Reid and Nahon, 1985; Van der Steen, 1998) and in driving simulation with longitudinal movements (e.g., Filliard, 2009; Neimer and Mohellebi, 2009) as well as in a tilt-coordination task (e.g., Groen and Bles, 2004). This study was concerned with the coupling between visual and inertial cues in a motorcycle simulator. To date, there have been only very few studies working toward these ends (Cossalter et al., 2010; Kageyama and Tagani, 2002; Stedmon et al., 2009). All motion-base simulators including driving, riding and Ô¨Çight simulators have a limited range of movement due to restricted actuators. Flight roll has the same basic dynamics as motorcycle roll. Absolute roll angles of motorcycles are never rendered not only due to these physical limits, but because doing so introduces lateral and a gravity forces that in real riding are balanced by a centrifugal force, which allows the motorcyclist to maintain balance. In more detail, in order to pass through curves, real motorcycles must reach lean angles (hereafter, theoretical lean angles) that correspond to  0003-6870/$ e see front matter √ì 2013 Elsevier Ltd and The Ergonomics Society.

A. Shahar et al.  / Applied Ergonomics 45 (2014) 734e740  735  both their linear speed and their trajectory‚Äôs curvature (which is typically nearly identical to the road curvature). For a given cur- vature, greater speeds require more extreme lean angles. Similarly, for a given speed, larger curvatures, hence, tighter curves require more extreme lean angles. When leaning a real motorcycle, the continuous forces, mainly gravity ‚Äúpulling‚Äù the rider toward the ground, are compensated during the steady state part of the curve by a centrifugal force. Consequently, there are virtually no lateral forces operating on the rider. One manner to cope with the false side forces generated when tilting a motorcycle mock-up is delivering most of the tilt sensation by rolling the visual scene (e.g., Cossalter et al., 2010). In Ô¨Çight simulators high-pass Ô¨Ålters are used so that the roll cue is gener- ated without a continuous lateral force false cue. However, the pilot seats in a sealed cab, whereas on motorcycle simulators the rider can see the Ô¨Çoor. Importantly, the proximity to the ground when leaning a motorcycle might actually be an important component in the motorcycling experience, one that is lost when the roll is delivered through the visual. Moreover, there are a few other substantial differences between steering and angular movements of an aircraft and a motorcycle, such as the manner by which the posture adapted by a motorcyclist when negotiating curves can affect the coordinated motion of the motorcycle/rider system, suggesting that knowledge from aircraft simulation needs be implemented in motorcycle simulators with some caution. Kageyama and Tagani (2002) have examined the relationship between the physical movement of the simulator on the roll axis and the roll motion of the visual scene (hereafter, physical roll and visual roll) associated with a credible illusion of roll among mo- torcyclists. They successfully reproduced the most realistic illusion when the scale factor for the motorcycle mock-up was twice as large as compared to the visual scene. These Ô¨Åndings however are based on a sample of only four participants. In Cossalter et al. (2010), the opposite pattern was found, that is, the most realistic riding feeling was reported when the roll of the visual scene was proportionally larger than that of the mock-up of the motorcycle. Stedmon et al. (2009) compared conditions where the visual scene has been rolled in the opposite direction from that of the motorcycle roll movement on the same axis and conditions where it remained horizontal. While both of these conditions resulted in similar riding performance, 10 of 16 riders preferred the conÔ¨Ågu- ration where the visual scene was rolled, 2 preferred the conÔ¨Ågu- ration where it was not rolled, whereas 4 participants had no preference. Although rolling the visual scene in the opposite di- rection from that of the motorcycle roll movement on the same axis seems to comply with geometric principles if the motorcyclist‚Äôs head is perfectly aligned with his or her body and with the motorcycle when leaning into the bend, motorcyclists often keep their head upright, thereby keeping their eyes parallel to the road. In the context of an aircraft simulator, it has been found that visually induced roll sensation is inÔ¨Çuenced by head orientation (Young et al., 1975). On a motorcycle, the proximity to the road surface and the exact point of Ô¨Åxation might both operate as moderating factors, which further inÔ¨Çuence the illusion of a rolled visual scene. In this regard, it is quite likely that both the direction of the roll and its amplitude (roll angle) are dependent on the riding posture and on the visual strategies. In the current study, experienced riders were required to tune the visual and physical roll motions to achieve a realistic sensation of leaning, that is, similar to real-world riding, for a variety of theoretical lean angles and road curvatures. They thus received a greater level of freedom than in previous studies, where partici- pants had to judge pre-determined gains. As such, this study would a), provide useful insight on motorcyclists‚Äô own preferential coupling between the physical and the visual rolls and b), allow  examining whether indeed motorcyclists have a clear preference for a visual scene that is rolled in the opposite direction of the bend. Selecting some theoretical lean angles that exceed the limits of our simulator‚Äôs actuators, would allow further insight into the extent to which experienced motorcyclists might be willing to accept visual angular roll to compensate for the limited physical angular roll. Because theoretical lean angles correspond to both speed and trajectory (i.e., curvature), in order to create the independent var- iable ‚Äòtheoretical lean angles‚Äô for the chosen curvatures (the second independent variable), the participants performed their task while the virtual motorcycle‚Äôs trajectory and speed had been both computerized and automated. Thus, the chosen radii of curvatures were coupled with appropriate speeds, to produce the chosen theoretical lean angles. Thus, the participants sat on the simulator, while tuning the physical and visual roll motions so that these would best match the virtual motorcycle‚Äôs trajectory and speed that they were experiencing and that they did not control. The magni- tudes of the roll motions applied by the participants were compared to the theoretical lean angles for the variety of riding conditions. We assessed the extent to which these roll motions deviate from what might be expected (i.e., the theoretical angles), and we discuss the possible reasons for this. Finally, the current study aimed to further explore the effects of the size of the visual display and of the visual angle (the third in- dependent variable) on the rendering model. Based on evidence demonstrating that speed is perceived to be faster when visual information is presented on a wide- than on a narrow-display (e.g., Alfano and Michel, 1990; Jamson, 2000; Pretto et al., 2009; Toet et al., 2007) and because for a given curvature higher speeds require more radical lean angles, one might expect that the par- ticipants would reach greater overall rolls for the same riding conditions (i.e., linear speeds and curve characteristics), when these are presented on a wide- as compared to a narrow-display.  2. Method  2.1. Design  A 3  2  2 within subjects design was employed with three theoretical lean angles (10 , 20 and 30 ), two road curvatures (150 and 300 m) and two conditions of Ô¨Åeld of view (narrow and wide). SpeciÔ¨Åcally, the visual representation of the riding conditions with respect to the radii of curvatures and approaching speeds was such that if occurred on a real road the rider would have had to lean the motorcycle by 10 , 20 , or 30 in order to pass safely through the bend. Thus, given the theoretical lean angles and the radii of cur- vatures chosen, six passing speeds were obtained (see Table 1), of which each two corresponds to the three theoretical angles per each of the curvatures. The participants underwent the same type of task twice, once with a narrow Ô¨Åeld of view (FoV) and once with a wide FoV. For each of the FoV conditions, the test consisted of one block per each of the six sub-conditions created by the theoretical lean  Table 1 Speeds of the virtual motorcycle (km/h) are given as a function of the theoretical lean angles and radii of curvatures. Speeds were determined on the basis of the following formula: v ¬º O (RC.g.tan(4)), where v is the passing speed, RC the radius of curvature, g the gravity and 4 the roll angle of the theoretical lean angle.

Each block had two trials that ended with a left bend and two trials that ended with a right bend and that were randomly distributed within that block. The six blocks within each of the FoV conditions were presented in a random fashion, with a Ô¨Åve minutes break between each three blocks. There was a 10 min break between the two FoV conditions. Half of the participants completed the narrow FoV blocks before the wide FoV blocks and half of them completed the narrow FoV blocks after the wide FoV blocks. Half of each of these sub-groups completed the training in the narrow FoV and half of them completed the training in the wide FoV. The dependent measures analyzed were the magnitude of the roll motions applied by the participants, including the physical roll, the visual roll, and the sum of the visual and the physical roll (the overall roll).  2.2.  Participants  Twenty nine motorcyclists (27 males and 2 females, mean age ¬º 36 years, SD ¬º 8.1, mean license seniority ¬º 11.3 years, SD ¬º 8.9) volunteered to participate in this study. They were recruited through advertisements that were posted via mailing lists of the French Institute of Sciences and Technology for Transport, Development and Networks (IFSTTAR) and in motorcyclist forums. All of them had normal or corrected-to-normal vision. The study was approved by the local ethics committee (IFSTTAR Ethics Committee).  2.3.  Experimental setup and task  The experiment was conducted on a powered motion-base motorcycle simulator (Nehaoua et al., 2007; see Fig. 1), a project initiated by INRETS - MSIS and carried out in collaboration with IBISC (Universit√© Evry Val d‚ÄôEssonne) and IEF (University Paris-Sud) laboratories. The simulator consists of a standard motorcycle (125 cm3) equipped with all basic parts including steering column with handlebars, gas tank, seat, footrests, throttle, front and rear brakes, and a gearbox. The steering column is equipped with a force feedback motor. Beyond several actuators and sensors used to generate motion in the three axes, roll motion was obtained via two lateral electric activators that replaced the front fork. The highest roll motion that was used was 12.5 due to actuator limitations. In accordance with real-world riding, higher speeds and larger lean angles resulted in faster rolls. The rolling center was located approximately 30 cm below the simulator‚Äôs seat.  In the narrow FoV condition, the simulated scene was played (1024  1280 pixel through a Projection-design F-22 projector resolution) onto a white screen (1.88 m width  2.40 m height). When seated on the simulator the participants faced the screen at a distance of approximately 1.65 m, with images subtending a visual angle approximating 60  70 . In the wide FoV condition, two additional identical projectors were used for playing the side views onto two further identical screens positioned to the left and right of the central screen at a set angle of 120 . The side screens extended the 60 horizontal visual angle of the central screen to 180 (see Fig. 2). The visual scene represented a single carriageway winding road with standard white lane-markings in a trafÔ¨Åc-free rural environ- ment and was refreshed at a rate of 30 Hz. The scene displayed within each trial consisted of a 100 m long straight road followed by four successive bends, which included two left and two right bends that were separated by a 100 m long straight road. All of the bends within a trial had the same radius of curvature. Each trial termi- nated 50 m after the last bend. Participants were informed on- screen that the trial has ended. The virtual motorcycle rode at the center of the right lane of the road; its trajectory and speed were both computerized and auto- mated. The task was to tune the visual and the physical roll motions when riding through curves aiming to reach a similar leaning sensation to real-world riding. The participants were allowed to tune during both the transition from straights to turns and during the steady state section of the bend. Two pairs of push buttons allowed the participants to perform this task. The horn and the starter, which were located on the left and right handlebars and were pressed with the thumbs, leaned the simulator in the direc- tion of the press. The lean angle of the simulator continued to in- crease for as long as the button was being pressed (until the maximum degree was obtained). Once the button was released, the simulator remained at the angular position that has been reached. Participants could also decrease the lean angle by pressing the button located at the side counter to the side to which they were leaning. At the end of each bend the motorcycle automatically returned to the upright position. Two additional buttons that were Ô¨Åxed above the horn and the starter and that were pressed with the index Ô¨Ångers rolled the visual scene in the direction of the press. Operation of the buttons was such that both hands could be kept on the handlebar at all times.  2.4.  Procedure  At the beginning of the experimental session, the experimenter explained the task to the participants and demonstrated them how to perform it. Participants were explained that they were free to roll the physical and visual dimensions at any time and magnitude as they saw Ô¨Åt, and that at the end of each bend the motorcycle and the visual scene would automatically return to the upright position. They were further explained that following the initial calibration obtained during the Ô¨Årst bend, their input would be registered and  Fig. 1. Motion base motorcycle simulator.  Fig. 2.

Consequently, from the second bend onwards, they would be given the opportunity to readjust their initial tuning by increasing or reducing the roll angle until they achieve the optimal sensation of riding. The participants then wore a motorcycle helmet and sat on the simulator facing the screen. They completed a training session, after which they completed the test phase. The complete session lasted approximately 50 min.  2.5. Data analysis  In each trial, the magnitude of the physical and of the visual roll angle obtained at the end of the fourth and Ô¨Ånal bend was used for the analyses. The overall roll (i.e., the sum of the visual and the physical roll) was also calculated. Each of these three dependent 3  2  2 measures were subjected to a (Theoretical lean angle  Road curvature  FoV) repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA). The data of one participant who did not com- plete the session due to motion sickness were excluded from all of the analyses.  3. Results  Qualitative analysis has revealed that although all of the 28 participants have leaned the motorcycle in the direction of the bend, only 18 of them have consistently leaned the visual scene in the opposite direction to the bend. The data of the remaining 10 participants are discussed separately (Section 3.5). ANOVAs were initially performed with bend direction in the model. As this factor did not yield any signiÔ¨Åcant effect, it was removed from the model. Fig. 3 displays the magnitudes of physical and visual rolls for the 12 roll  road curvature sub-conditions created by the theoretical design  FoV design.  3.1. Visual roll  The 3  2  2 ANOVA revealed a signiÔ¨Åcant main effect for road curvature (F(1,17) ¬º 13.96, p < .01), indicating that the magnitude of the visual roll in the 300 m curvature was larger than in the 150 m curvature. A post-hoc test (NewmaneKeuls hereafter) on the  signiÔ¨Åcant effect of theoretical lean angle (F(2,34) ¬º 54.56, p < .001) showed that the magnitude of the visual roll was larger in the 20 than in the 10 angle and larger yet in the 30 theoretical lean angle (ps < .001). Although the main effect of FoV was not signiÔ¨Åcant [p > .10], the 3-way interaction approached signiÔ¨Åcance (p ¬º .06). The patterns of the interaction were identical to those indicated by a sig- niÔ¨Åcant 3-way interaction yielded by the ANOVA performed on overall roll (see 3.3).  3.2.  Physical roll  The 3  2  2 ANOVA revealed a signiÔ¨Åcant main effect for road curvature (F(1,17) ¬º 15.73, p < .001), indicating that the magnitude of the physical roll in the 300 m curvature was larger than in the 150 m curvature. A post-hoc test on the signiÔ¨Åcant main effect of theoretical lean angle (F(2, 34) ¬º 43.55, p < .001) showed that the magnitude of the physical roll was larger in the 20 than in the 10 angle and larger yet in the 30 theoretical lean angle (ps < .01). The main effect of FoV was not signiÔ¨Åcant lean angle (p ¬º .08) suggested slightly more roll [p > .10]. The interaction between FoV and theoretical in the wide-, than in the narrow-FoV, only in the 20 condition.  3.3. Overall roll (sum of visual and physical roll)  The 3  2  2 ANOVA revealed a signiÔ¨Åcant main effect for road curvature (F(1, 17) ¬º 17.28, p < .001), indicating that the magnitude of the overall roll in the 300 m curvature was larger than in the 150 m curvature. A post-hoc test on the signiÔ¨Åcant effect of theo- lean angle (F(2, 34) ¬º 77.79, p < .001) retical showed that the magnitude of the overall roll was larger in the 20 than in the 10 angle and larger yet in the 30 theoretical lean angle (ps < .001). Although the main effect of FoV was not signiÔ¨Åcant [p > .10], the 3- way interaction was signiÔ¨Åcant (F(2,34) ¬º 3.29, p < .05). Post hoc tests for the interaction (see Fig. 4) indicated that while the magnitude of the overall roll was larger in the 300 m than in the 150 m curvature in both FoV conditions in the 20 as well as in the 30 in the 10 condition this difference between theoretical rolls, the curvatures appeared only in the wide FoV (p < .01) but not in in the 10 the narrow FoV [p > .10].

Speed and curvature  In the current experiment, the theoretical lean angles and road curvatures have both co-varied with speed, with faster average speeds in larger theoretical lean angles than in smaller angles and in wider bends than in tighter bends. Given our need to generate and control for speciÔ¨Åc theoretical rolls that correspond to particular road curvatures and due to the relations between speed, theoretical lean angle and road curvature, this confound was unavoidable. To further our insight in this regard, regression analyses were conducted sepa- rately for the narrow and wide FoV conditions, with speed and road curvature as independent variables and magnitude of the roll of the various measures as dependent variables. SigniÔ¨Åcant models emerged for all dependent variables, for both FoV conditions (Fs (2, 429) > 52.8, ps < .001). For the narrow FoV the models accounted for 20%, 21% and 23% whereas for the wide FoV they accounted for 25%, 28% and 30% of the variances in the visual, physical and the overall rolls, respectively. For the narrow FoV, linear relationships were found (bs ¬º .53 between both factors and magnitude of the visual roll and  .16, ps < .01, for speed and curvature, respectively), between (b ¬º .51, p < .001 for speed and only speed and the physical roll b ¬º  .08, p > .10 for curvature) and between both speed and curvature and the overall roll (bs ¬º .56 and  .16, ps < .01, respectively). For the wide FoV, linear relationships were revealed between both the speed and curvature factors and the visual roll (bs ¬º .61 and  .20, ps < .001, for speed and curvature, respectively), between speed and road cur- vature and the physical roll (bs ¬º .61 and  .14, ps < .01, respectively) overall roll (bs ¬º .66 and  .21, ps < .001, respectively). and between both speed and road curvature and magnitude of the  3.5. Other preferences of visual roll  Only 18 of the 28 participants have consistently leaned the vi- sual scene in the opposite direction to the bend. Two motorcyclists  did not lean the visual scene at all times. All of the remaining eight motorcyclists have leaned the visual scene in the same direction that they have leaned the motorcycle, hence, in the direction of the bend, on at least some of the trials. Four of them have consistently leaned the visual scene in the same direction that they have leaned the motorcycle. The remaining four participants were not as consistent, rolling the visual scene in the direction of the bend on some trials and not rolling it on other trials, or rolling it in the di- rection of the bend on some trials and in the opposite direction on others.  4. Discussion  The participants increased the roll angles with the increase in the theoretical lean angles (i.e., the angles that a motorcycle must reach to pass through bends), indicating that these motorcyclists were aware of the changes in the riding conditions and responded in a sensible manner to these changes. Although the participants overestimated the theoretical lean angles, these overestimations decreased with the increase in the theoretical lean angle. Such overestimations are consistent with studies comparing other real and virtual environment such as ball catching (e.g., Baur√®s et al., 2009) or distance perception (e.g., Plumert et al., 2005), presum- ably suggesting that motorcycle simulations may require ampli- fying the subjective experience of the curves. The increments in the roll angles were due to a rise in both vi- In the 10 sual and physical rolls. condition the overall roll was distributed more or less equally between the visual and physical dimensions. Although also for the 20 , the tuning resulted in a gain in the 30 con- (visual roll/physical roll ratio) of approximately 1, dition, most of the roll was delivered through the visual. While one might argue that the extent that the motorcyclists rolled the visual scene was determined by their need to compensate for the limited motion base, perhaps a more plausible explanation is that they wanted to avoid sensation of falling off the simulator, possibly due to the lack of centrifugal forces that participate in the control of equilibrium in a dynamic natural situation. Indeed, in none of the  Fig. 4. Roll magnitude (overall roll) as a function of the interaction between Ô¨Åeld of view, theoretical lean angle and road curvature.

A. Shahar et al.  / Applied Ergonomics 45 (2014) 734e740  739  conditions did the participants make use of the full 12.5 range of sub-condition (the 30 the roll motion. Moreover, only in one 300 m), the participants exceeded 12 and still they stayed below the actuators limits. This pattern was consistent across the two FoV conditions used in the experiment. Nonetheless, the explanation that the participants chose to roll the visual scene rather than to lean the simulator only because they feared falling off the simulator cannot account for a) the result showing that the physical roll, averaging on 10 in the 20 condition, was still signiÔ¨Åcantly larger in that condition than in the 10 condition, even though in the 10 too all necessary roll was achievable through the physical, and b) the result showing that the physical roll was signiÔ¨Åcantly larger in the 30 than in the 20 condition, even though both conditions exceed the 12.5 limits of the simulator. These results suggest that simulating the experience of leaning on a motorcycle is best ach- ieved through a combination of visual roll and physical roll and that any changes in the theoretical lean angles require adjustments to both of these dimensions. The signiÔ¨Åcant main effects of road curvatures on both the visual and physical rolls indicated that the magnitude of the roll was greater in the wider 300 m curvature than in tighter 150 m bends. As explained above (3.4), the theoretical lean angles and road curvatures in this experiment have both co-varied with speed. In spite of this, since each of the curvature conditions consisted of an equal amount of theoretical roll trials, one might not expect to Ô¨Ånd an effect of road curvature on the magnitudes of any of the rolls. More than that, we found greater magnitudes in wider bends, while had the participants relied solely, or especially, on the curvature and ignored speed while performing the tuning task, the opposite pattern would be expected. This pattern therefore must indicate that when tuning the motorcyclists were more inÔ¨Çuenced by the speed of the motorcycle than by curvature or by the combination of speed and curvature. Indeed, the regression analyses revealed much stronger relations between speed and rolls (bs  .51) than between road curvatures and rolls (bs  j.21j). These relations were generally stronger in the wide FoV, most probably reÔ¨Çecting the critical role that peripheral Ô¨Çow of information plays in the perception of speed (Shinar, 1978). Nevertheless, also in the narrow FoV, the visual, physical and overall rolls in the 150 m 20 condition (Ms ¬º 15.2 , 9.7, 24.9 ) were higher than the pertinent rolls in the 300 m 10 condition (Ms ¬º 11.6 , 8.5 , 20.1 ), in spite of having effectually the same speeds (83 and 82 km/h, respectively for the two conditions). These patterns have repeated themselves in the wide FoV: higher rolls were obtained in the 150 m 20 condition (visual: M ¬º 17.2 ; physical: M ¬º 10.4 ) than in the 300 m 10 condition (visual: M ¬º 14 ; physical: M ¬º 8.5 ), providing direct evidence that the participants were also sensitive to changes in road curvature per se, accurately increasing the roll in tighter bends. The prediction that due to faster perceived speeds in the wide-, than in the narrow-FoV, the participants would reach greater overall rolls in the former condition was not supported. It is quite possible that in addition to faster perceived speeds, the additional lateral information at the same time also led to greater sensitivity to the changes in visual roll, resulting in conÔ¨Çicting inÔ¨Çuences and thus in the absence of a FoV effect on roll. Finally, although most of the participants in this experiment have consistently rolled the visual scene in the opposite direction to which they have leaned the motorcycle, one third of them have either rolled the visual scene in the same direction of the bend, or have not rolled it in any direction. These different patterns might reÔ¨Çect differences between the body and head postures that mo- torcyclists tend to adapt when negotiating curves, the extent that they are used to reaching radical lean angles and that they lean off their bike into the turn, as well as their visual strategies. Extreme  angles are more rarely reached by the average motorcyclist and are only common among sport bikers. Indeed, in the current experi- ment the majority of the motorcyclists have rolled the visual scene in the opposite direction from the bend. In this regard, our results are in agreement with Stedmon et al. (2009) who found that most of the riders prefer a conÔ¨Åguration where the visual scene is rolled in the opposite direction to the motorcycle movement. In sum, we have shown that experienced motorcyclists indeed have the capability of taking into consideration in a sensible manner, variables such as the linear speed of the simulated motorcycle and the road curvatures, while reproducing the lean angles that a real motorcycle must reach in order to navigate safely through a bend. They were capable of doing so even though some of the inertial cues such as acceleration, jerk and centrifugal force were absent. This suggests that experienced motorcyclists have some internal representation of the lean angle they would achieve in the real world. While keeping in mind the large differences be- tween any simulation and that which is simulated and that simu- lators are incapable of delivering all of the physical stimulations a driver typically receives in real driving situations (Stoffregen et al., 2003), this study suggests that a realistic experience of negotiating curves can be created through amplifying the subjective experience of the curves by over-rolling the visual scene. These patterns are in agreement with Cossalter et al. (2010), whose participants reported the most realistic riding feeling when the roll of the visual scene was proportionally larger than that of the mock-up of the motor- cycle. However, this study also suggests that there is a certain minimum of angular roll motion of the simulator mock-up that experienced motorcyclists require and that the proximity to the ground when leaning a motorcycle might be an important component in the motorcycling experience, one that is lost when the roll is delivered through the visual. Nonetheless, this study shows that not only can over-rolling the visual scene be used to compensate for a limited motion base, it might be mandatory in order to reduce performance biases that can be enhanced due to fear of falling off the simulator, especially when the angle exceeds 10 and no form of washout is applied to remove the side forces (e.g., Cossalter et al., 2010; Reid and Nahon, 1985). Finally, this study presents data suggesting that future research and roll rendering models for motorcycle simulators will need to take into consideration a variety of factors such as the character- istics of the visual display setup and the different types of riding styles and postures that can inÔ¨Çuence both the inertial forces operating on the motorcyclists and how these motorcyclists perceive the visual world.

s0003687013002032,"  In elite sports, it is important to know what information is un- derstood by athletes and coaches, in order to help athletes improve their performance (e.g., Lorimer and Jowett, 2011; Macquet, 2013). The coach and athlete may interpret the situation in which the athlete is involved and athlete‚Äôs behavior quite differently. They both possess knowledge about the best way to achieve positive outcomes in relation to biomechanics, sport rules, athlete‚Äôs com- petencies and tendencies, contextual information such as the in- Ô¨Çuence of the wind on performance. There are likely differences in these underlying knowledge structures which will be revealed in the situation awareness of both athlete and coach. According to the schema theorists (e.g., Bartlet, 1932; Neisser, 1976; Norman, 1981; Piaget, 1926; Plant and Stanton, 2013), this knowledge is used at a speciÔ¨Åc time and situation to carry out and interpret athlete‚Äôs behavior and situation. Interpretation allows the coach and athlete to understand what went well or badly, and why (e.g., Hanton et al., 2009). Due to their bounded rationality (Simon,  * Corresponding author.

Tel.: √æ33 141 744 873; fax: √æ33 141 744 535. E-mail address: anne-claire.macquet@insep.fr (A.-C. Macquet).  1996), they cannot possibly understand all the elements of the situation. They rather interpret the ‚Äútriggers‚Äù of the situation (Norman, 1981). In elite sports, to improve performance, it seems important to know whether their ‚Äútriggers‚Äù are similar or different, and whether ‚Äútriggers‚Äù are understood at the same way. To carry out and interpret a behavior, the individuals use sche- mata which are stored in memory (e.g., Bartlet, 1932; Neisser, 1976; Norman, 1981; Piaget, 1926; Plant and Stanton, 2013). Schemata are continually reorganized and completed regarding the interactions of the individual‚Äôs with his/her environment in which the behavior is carried out. Anderson (1977) stressed Ô¨Åve main deÔ¨Åning features of schemata: (a) schemata are mapped meaningfully in speciÔ¨Åc way; (b) pertain to other macro-schemata and contain sub- schemata; (c) are modiÔ¨Åed regarding information perceived; (d) are restructured in relation to incoming information; and (e) are gestalt mental representations. Stanton et al. (2009) distinguish between two types of schemata: the genotype and phenotype. The genotype schemata refer to ‚Äúthe wider systemic factors that inÔ¨Çu- ence the development of individual cognitive phenomena and behavior‚Äù (p. 46). In sport context, genotype schemata are con- cerned with the ‚Äúideal‚Äù and expected behavior/skill as well as the athlete‚Äôs competencies and tendencies as athlete performs a task. They refer to his/her own schema-based theory of how to complete tasks efÔ¨Åciently. The phenotype is concerned with available infor- mation within the system; it is the blend of genotype, plus the  0003-6870/$ e see front matter √ì 2013 Elsevier Ltd and The Ergonomics Society.

Schema theory is used by psy- chologists to describe everyday activities, such as learning (Wood, 1998), sense-making and decision-making (e.g., Klein et al., 2010; Macquet and Kragba, 2014), situation awareness (Stanton et al., 2006) and human error (Plant and Stanton, 2013). According to Neisser‚Äôs (1976) theory of perceptioneaction cycle based on the work of James and Eleanor Gibson, the interaction between the operator and his/her environment is cyclical rather than linear. Operator is guided by the active knowledge structures, namely the schemata, to perceive and interpret information. In return, information contributes to change these structures and consequently change the direction of perception and interpreta- tion. Schemata determine what the operator is able to perceive and whether perceived information Ô¨Åts with the schemata. Neisser‚Äôs (1976) perceptioneaction cycle theory associated to the schema theory account both for how the environment and cognition ‚Äúguides‚Äù one‚Äôs perception and interpretation of the environment and situation. Stanton et al. (2009) have mapped the schema theory with the perceptioneaction cycle theory onto the concept of Situation Awareness (SA). SA allows explain how humans interact with their environment. In the literature, two main models are distinguished to describe SA: Endsley‚Äôs (1995) three-levels model, which is the most popular, and Smith‚Äôs and Hancock‚Äôs (1995) model based on Neisser‚Äôs perceptioneaction cycle theory. These models refer to different deÔ¨Ånition of SA. For Endsley (1995), SA represents awareness of ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs going on‚Äù and ‚Äúwhat might happen‚Äù when operators complete tasks in a complex system, and how awareness develops and is maintained. SA is a cognitive product which results from a separate process called situation assessment. For Smith and Hancock (1994), SA is the ‚Äúpicture‚Äù of the situation to which it re- fers. (p. 61). It requires adherence to the task goals and performance criteria, which implies that SA is goal-driven behavior. SA is the process of adaptation to task constraints. In this way, SA is directed externally towards the environment. It is responsible for conscious and dynamic reÔ¨Çection on the situation (Bedny and Meister, 1999). SA is at the same time a product and a process. Poor SA makes performance improvement difÔ¨Åcult, because individuals do not know what went well and what went badly or identify the wrong aspects of performance that went well or badly. According to what was said above, Smith‚Äôs and Hancock‚Äôs deÔ¨Å- nition of SA, based on the perceptioneaction cycle approach seems the most suitable to study team SA in complex environment. It allows to understand how the environment constraints the oper- ator‚Äô SA as well as what the ‚Äúpicture‚Äù of the situation is. It also proposed that people possess personalized ‚Äúgenotype‚Äù and ‚Äúphe- notypes‚Äù schemata that are triggered by the relevant task con- straints and required task performance. As Neisser puts it, ‚Äúschemata are developed by experience; everyone‚Äôs experiences are different; since every person‚Äôs perceptual history is unique we should all have unique cognitive structures‚Äù (Neisser, 1976, p. 187). This means that we should expect the athlete and coach to have different awareness of the same situation, one from the point of view of experiencing the situation Ô¨Årst hand and the other from the point of view of observing the athlete. The coach will also have many more years experience to draw upon as well as observations of many athletes‚Äô performance. They also may have had the expe- rience of being an athlete themselves before becoming a coach. Although the SA concept is applicable to a sports context, it has received little attention (James and Patrick, 2004). To our knowl- edge, only one study has focused on athlete and coach SA while involved in training sessions and competition (Macquet, 2013).  about having  ‚ÄúSA is  all  the  right  stuff‚Äù  Macquet has developed a method for analyzing coach‚Äôs and ath- lete‚Äôs SA in a sports context. Other studies on SA in sports centered on athletes‚Äô SA and decision-making (e.g., Johnson and Raab, 2003; Macquet, 2009; Macquet et al., 2012; Macquet and Fleurance, 2007). The coach and athlete work together in a speciÔ¨Åc environment. They belong to a collaborative system and team: a team contains at least two persons aiming the same main goals which they pursue collaboratively and can succeed or fail as a whole (e.g., Annett and Stanton, 2000; Klein et al., 2010). Salas et al. (1995) stressed that team SA is more than the combination of individual team member‚Äôs SA. In collective activities, individuals need to perceive, interpret and anticipate SA elements in relation to their role within the team and are required to share them (e.g., Salas et al., 1995). The concept of shared SA is ambiguous: do the team members accessing the same information understand the situation in exactly the same way whatever their role within the team? To respond to this question, Stanton et al. (2006) have recently developed the Distributed Situation Awareness (DSA) model. They have used Hutchins‚Äôs (1995) theory on distributed cognition and Hollnagel‚Äôs (1993) work about cognitive system engineering. Hutchins and Hollnagel stress that, rather than being solely in the heads of in- dividuals SA is also embedded in the context. Context provides useful information on ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs going on‚Äù, and arises from the in- teractions between individuals and between the individual and the situation. It is distributed across team members and artifacts. Even when team members have access to the same information, they make different connections between the information or link it in different ways in relation to their own skills, experiences, role and objectives in order to understand the situation. ‚ÄúAwareness‚Äù is the whole combined experience. The connections people make with data to build a frame (i.e., schema) are different. So, whilst they may share data, the connections of data-in-the-frame (i.e., schema) are different. Compatible SA refers to the phenomenon that allows the system to be a cognitive joint system (e.g., Stanton et al., 2006, 2009). Studying the compatibility between athlete‚Äôs and coach‚Äôs SA would allow insights into their SA at each point in time and determine whether together the athlete and coach have a more complete ‚Äúpicture‚Äù of the situation than either possesses alone. It also allows explain whether genotype and phenotype schemata are activated in the course of action. Moreover, information exchanges occurring between people are called transactions (e.g., Stanton et al., 2010). A transaction is an exchange of awareness rather than a sharing. These concepts of compatibility and transaction highlight the distributed nature of cognition and SA in comparison to the idea of shared SA in collaborative systems. In the DSA model, the cognitive system is viewed as a whole, using the information available to people during interactions. It is argued by Salmon et al. (2010b) that a similar model could be used to study collaborative systems, such as the coach-athlete system, and sport teams. DSA model is underpinned by the schema theory (e.g., Bartlet, 1932; Neisser, 1976; Norman, 1981; Piaget, 1926; Plant and Stanton, 2013), perceptioneaction cycle approach (Neisser, 1976), distributed cognition theory (Hutchins, 1995), and cognitive system engineering (Hollnagel, 1998). The use of schema theory and perceptioneaction cycle approach gives the DSA model a cyclical and parallel process of situation percep- tion and interpretation which serves to explain how and what the coach and athlete focus on, perceive and interpret the situation and possible causes of athlete‚Äôs behavior (they have pre-existing sche- mata). The use of perceptioneaction cycle approach, distributed cognition theory and cognitive system engineering allows focus on the system level (i.e., the coach and athlete considered as a whole)  
726  A .-C. Macquet, N.A . Stanton / Applied Ergonomics 45 (2014) 724e733  and coordination between the coach and athlete, and between them and their environment. DSA model seems well suited to explain coach‚Äôs and athlete‚Äôs SA in different practice contexts. To model DSA in collaborative systems, Stanton et al. (2006) developed a method centered around the construction of propo- sitional networks. Such networks link elements of information to account for information underlying the system awareness (i.e., data in the frame as proposed by Klein et al., 2010). They highlight the relationships between elements of information and the way each part of the system uses each element of information for each type of task to be performed. Although these networks are very useful for modeling system awareness and information elements underlying SA, their construction can be highly time-consuming, requires very skilled analysts, and is difÔ¨Åcult to present within articles (Salmon et al., 2010a). Moreover, it does not provide insights into the macro information elements of the system nor their frequency for each individual within the system. These insights could be used to improve intervention during training sessions and competitions. To avoid these limitations, we did not use this method and instead chose Macquet‚Äôs (2013) method. Macquet‚Äôs method allowed compare the consistency of coach‚Äôs and athlete‚Äôs SA during com- petitions and training sessions to identify compatible information elements. This method was developed to show the content of compatible information elements between one coach and three athletes and modes of compatibility of information elements (i.e., no compatibility, compatibility, mutual compatibility). We sup- plemented this method to achieve the goals of the present study. The present study aimed to compare the consistency of six athletes‚Äô and three coaches‚Äô SA at each point in time during training sessions and competitions. SA was studied from the information elements it contained. These information elements pertained to the coach‚Äôs and athlete‚Äôs schemata which were activated at each point in time and referred to the phenotype and genotype schemata. These schemata and their speciÔ¨Åc content gave insight about the ‚Äúpicture‚Äù of the situation and athlete‚Äôs behavior to which they referred. More speciÔ¨Åcally, the present study aimed to categorize: (a) the content of information elements held by each athlete and his/her coach at each point in time they (b) the content of infor- mation elements which were compatible between the athlete and his/her coach; and (c) the nature of information elements held by each athlete and his/her coach, namely the phenotypes and geno- types schemata. The content and nature of information elements pertaining to SA gave insight into the sense the participants made of situation and their projection into the future (i.e., what to focus on in the following action, complete a speciÔ¨Åc behavior to avoid negative outcomes, such as getting a drink to avoid cramps). The compatibility between the information elements at each point in time showed they understood the situation at the same way. The present study was conducted for hammer throwing and rowing. These sports are technical sports, in which athletes need to demonstrate efÔ¨Åcient technique to perform well. Hammer throwing consists of a set of discrete actions that are combined to form an overall action (i.e., a throw). Each set is independent from the previous and following ones. Rowing consists of a series of actions which follow one another in cycles; actions are interde- pendent and of long duration.  2. Method  2.1.  Participants  Six elite athletes (two female and two male hammer throwers, and one female and one male rower) and three male coaches (one in hammer throwing and two in rowing) volunteered to participate. The criteria employed to select them included: (a) practicing their  sport for more than 6 years; (b) being elite athlete; (c) working with their coach/athlete for several years; and (d) coaching in elite sport for more than 10 years. Athletes ranged in age from 20 to 31 years (M ¬º 26.33 years, SD ¬º 4.36 years); they had been practicing their sport for an average of 10 years (SD ¬º 3years). Two of them also participated in the Olympic Games. Coaches ranged in age from 36 (M ¬º 46.33 years, SD ¬º 11 years); to 58 years they had been coaching for an average of 23.66 years (SD ¬º 13.28 years). Athletes had been working with their coach for an average of 7.5 years (SD ¬º 3.27 years). No other athletes and coaches who fulÔ¨Ålled all these requirements were available to participate to recorded training sessions and competition, and self-confrontation in- terviews. Such studies have often involved very few participants because, by deÔ¨Ånition, only a few individuals become expert (e.g., Ericsson et al., 2004; Nieuwenhuys et al., 2008). Participants were given pseudonyms to guaranty their conÔ¨Å- dentiality: HT1, HT2, HT3, HT4 (hammer throwers 1e4), and R1 and R2 (rowers 1 and 2). The study was approved by a local ethics committee.  2.2. Data collection  To better understand what happen in different practice con- texts, Athletes‚Äô and coaches‚Äô SA was studied on three sessions pertaining to the main practice contexts in elite sport: (a) HT1, HT2, HT3, and R1 participated in a winter training session (WTS) that aimed to improve athletes‚Äô technique to prepare for competitions (e.g., Macquet, 2010); (b) HT1, HT2, HT3, and HT4 participated in an international competition to qualify for the European Champion- ships; and (c) HT1, HT2, HT4, and R2 participated in a post- competition training session (PCTS) that aimed to adjust training according to what had happened in competition (Macquet, 2010; R2‚Äôs competition was the French Championship). In rowing, coaches cannot observe and communicate with their athletes during competitions, so they could not participate in the compe- tition session. Two types of qualitative data were collected: (a) video recording of athletes‚Äô behavior, and coaches‚Äô and athletes‚Äô communication during training sessions and competitions; and (b) verbalizations during post-training interviews (Macquet, 2013).  2.2.1. Video recording of athletes‚Äô and coaches‚Äô behavior during training sessions and competitions  Athletes‚Äô behavior, and coaches‚Äô and athletes‚Äô communication were recorded by a digital camera and an HF microphone worn by the coach. In hammer throwing, the camera was Ô¨Åxed behind the circle and the net for a wide angle, to record the thrower‚Äôs behavior, hammer trajectory, and communication. In rowing, the camera was held by a researcher in the coach‚Äôs boat to record the rower‚Äôs behavior, rower‚Äôs skiff, and coach-athlete communication. The videotapes were used to provide behavioral and contextual data but also to stimulate the parties to re-experience the training ses- sion and competition during the interview.  2.2.2. Verbalizations during post-training interviews  Verbalization data were collected during self-confrontation in- terviews conducted with each athlete and coach separately. For each interview, the video recording of the training session or competition was played and the participant was invited to describe and comment upon his activity during the course of action without a posteriori analysis, rationalization or justiÔ¨Åcation. He/she could stop the video as he/she wanted and go back to comment on a speciÔ¨Åc event, thought, feeling, perception he/she had in the course of action. The interviewer used speciÔ¨Åc prompts to encourage the participant to describe his/her SA as it was experienced (i.e., what  
A.-C. Macquet, N.A. Stanton / Applied Ergonomics 45 (2014) 724e733  727  did you perceived at this point in time? What did you feel? What did you do or aimed to do? What did you think about? What did you say to you?). The full interviews were video-recorded in order to check correspondence between the comments and action that was being described (i.e., contextual features and behaviors during the training sessions and competitions). Interviews were con- ducted by the same person, who had already conducted self- confrontation interviews of this type in previous studies (e.g., Macquet, 2013, 2009; Macquet et al., 2012). They took place immediately after the training session and competition or the day after, but before the following training session, depending on the availability of participants. 24 interviews were conducted and las- ted between 30 and 99 min for athletes (M ¬º 62 min; SD ¬º 28 min) and 26 and 97 min for coaches (M ¬º 49 min; SD ¬º 21 min). In- terviews were transcribed.  2.3. Data processing  Data processing involved four steps: (a) identifying meaningful units; (b) categorizing the content of information elements held by each athlete and his/her coach at each point in time; (c) catego- rizing the content of compatible information elements between the athlete and his/her coach; and (d) identifying the nature of infor- mation elements held by each athlete and his/her coach at each point in time, namely the genotype and phenotype schemata. Firstly, as in Macquet‚Äôs (2013) method, two researchers used inductive analysis (Corbin and Strauss, 1990). Each researcher divided the transcripts into meaningful units according to the participant‚Äôs activated schemata (see Table 1). Each unit contained information elements pertaining to the activated schemata in relation to different parts of the athlete‚Äôs behavior, focus, feelings, and situation. Secondly, as in Macquet‚Äôs (2013) method, meaningful units were synchronized with the video recordings from the training sessions and competition. Researchers did not elicit information elements when the athlete and coach were communicating because, ac- cording to the DSA model, communication leads to compatibility (because one accessed to the interpretation of the other one). They also compared the athlete‚Äôs focus with the coach‚Äôs feedback on the previous throw or row, to identify whether the athlete had in mind  the instructions and feedback given by the coach, when preparing to undertake an action. In contrast to Macquet‚Äôs (2013) method, researchers then categorized the content of information elements held by: (a) athletes; and (b) coaches, at the same point in time. Each category was identiÔ¨Åed and its properties described (see Table 1). Thirdly, as in Macquet‚Äôs (2013) method, researchers compared synchronized meaningful units of each athlete‚Äôs and his/her coach‚Äôs SA in order to categorize the content of information elements that were compatible (see Table 1). As comparing synchronized mean- ingful units, they checked whether information elements were compatible or different. They were compatible as: (a) the athlete and coach reported on the same information elements (e.g., ‚ÄúI‚Äôm tired/she looks tired‚Äù, Rower 1 and her coach, WTS); and (b) they talked about the same part of behavior and situation, and the one described what happened and the other one explained possible causes of what happened at a speciÔ¨Åc time (e.g., ‚ÄúI felt the hammer  dropped on the right in the Ô¨Årst turn and stayed there a bit‚Äù/‚Äúhis rotation lacks speed in the Ô¨Årst turn because his right support is a little  weak‚Äù HT1 and his coach). They were different as: (a) the coach and athlete reported on different information about the same situation, part of behavior and performance; (b) they reported on the same  point differently (e.g., ‚ÄúI think I‚Äôm going to be stiff during the training session‚Äù/‚ÄúI believe she‚Äôs not going to be stiff‚Äù, Rower 1 and her coach,  WTS); and (c) only one participant reported information elements regarding his/her SA at a speciÔ¨Åc time (e.g., ‚ÄúI feel the throw distance is correct‚Äù/the coach did not report on HT2‚Äôs performance). Fourthly, to supplement Macquet‚Äôs (2013) method, researchers analyzed information elements held by the coach and those held by athlete, in order to identify whether information elements per- tained to genotypes and phenotypes schemata. Information ele- ments pertained to phenotype schemata as the participant solely described athlete‚Äôs behavior, thought, feeling, focus, and situation In- formation elements pertained to a comparison of the phenotype with genotype schemata as the participant compared the put/ behavior just being done to that was expected to be done to perform well, regarding their own ‚Äúschema-based theory‚Äù of how to throw a hammer and to row efÔ¨Åciently. In other terms, the participant activated knowledge in relation to the behavior just  in the second turn‚Äù, HT3 PCTS).

Activated knowledge example) and tacit (e.g., ‚Äúher PCTS). Due to the way we conducted the interviews (i.e., report on speciÔ¨Åc situations and behaviors and avoid general descriptions on how to perform well), we did not expect to identify genotype schemata solely. After each step, researchers compared their results and dis- cussed any initial disagreement until consensus was reached. The reliability of the coding procedure was assessed with Bellack‚Äôs agreement rate (Von Someren et al., 1994). The initial agreement rate was between 85.31% and 87.71% depending on the data pro- cessing steps. Interview transcripts were divided into 898 mean- ingful units for athletes and 653 for coaches.  3. Results  Results are presented in three parts: (a) content of information elements pertaining to SA and held by athletes and those held by coaches; (b) content of compatible information elements between each athlete and his/her coach; and (b) nature of information ele- ments held by athlete and those held by coaches.  3.1.  Content of  information elements held by athletes and coaches  Analysis of the content of information elements pertaining to the coach‚Äôs and athlete‚Äôs SA indicated Ô¨Åve categories of information elements: (a) technical elements; (b) athlete‚Äôs psychological states; (c) organization and safety; (d) performance; and (e) athlete‚Äôs experience (see Table 1). Technical elements referred to information about the spatial and temporal form of the action the athlete had just completed and was about to complete, and hammer/skiff move. For example, HT1 said:  ‚ÄúI felt my legs were Ô¨Çexed more than in the previous put‚Äù, and his coach said: ‚Äúthe leg Ô¨Çexion is correct‚Äù (WTS).  Athlete‚Äôs psychological states were related to his/her motiva- tion, conÔ¨Ådence, and mood during the action. For example, R2 said:  ‚ÄúI‚Äôm now doing this difÔ¨Åcult drill. I feel more conÔ¨Ådent‚Äù, and his coach said: ‚Äúhe‚Äôs now better at the end of this drill. I think that he‚Äôs more conÔ¨Ådent‚Äù (PCTS).  Organization and safety concerned the current training session and competition program, the circle surface state (i.e., neither  slippery nor rough) or river state (e.g., eddies, debris, wind), and the athlete‚Äôs freshness during the action. For example, R1 said:  barge is making waves‚Äù and her coach said: ‚Äúthe water because of the barge‚Äù (WTS).  ‚Äúthe is moving  Performance referred to the throw length or skiff speed and stroke rate. For example, HT3 said: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs 70.23 meters‚Äù (competition). Athlete‚Äôs experience related to previous events and associated knowledge that the athlete and coach shared about the athlete. For  example, HT1 said ‚ÄúI have a drink to avoid cramp around the 20th throw‚Äù and his coach said: ‚ÄúHe drinks because he gets cramp more often than other athletes‚Äù (PCTS).  Results showed that technical elements were the most frequently identiÔ¨Åed category among athletes and coaches (see Fig. 1); they were more frequently mentioned by coaches than athletes, with the exception of HT3 in competition (see Table 2); they were also more frequently mentioned by coaches and athletes in training sessions than competition and in PCTS than WTS; furthermore, they were more frequently mentioned by coaches and athletes in hammer throwing than in rowing. Psychological states were mainly mentioned in competition; they were mentioned more by athletes than coaches. Organization and safety was more frequently mentioned by athletes than coaches, across all sessions, with the exception of HT2 and his coach in competition; it was more frequently reported in rowing than hammer throwing. Per- formance was more frequently mentioned by athletes than coaches, across all sessions, with the exception of HT1 and HT3 and her coach in WTS; it was more frequently mentioned in competi- tion than training sessions for all athletes and their coach, with the exception of coach of HT2. Athlete‚Äôs experience was seldom mentioned by the athletes and their coaches across all sessions.  3.2. Content of compatible information elements held by the athletes and coaches  The comparison between the information elements reported by the athletes and their coach at each point in time showed whether information elements were compatible or different. They were considered compatible if their meaning was similar or the same  (e.g., HT2 said: ‚ÄúI transferred my weight to the right support too late‚Äù ‚Äúhe‚Äôs not early enough on his right support‚Äù,  and his coach said: competition). They were considered different if their meaning was different, i.e., when: (a) the athlete and coach commented upon different parts of the behavior and situation or only one of them commented on it (e.g., HT3 said: ‚ÄúI  felt the hammer hitting the soil on the third turn‚Äù, and her coach said: ‚Äúher placement on the Ô¨Årst  two turns is  Fig. 1. Distribution of  information elements according to session and athletes‚Äô and coaches‚Äô SA.  
A.-C. Macquet, N.A. Stanton / Applied Ergonomics 45 (2014) 724e733  729  fairly good‚Äù, WTS); or (b) they commented on the same part of the behavior and situation differently (e.g., R1 said: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm feeling stiff‚Äù and her coach said: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt  think she‚Äôs going to be stiff during the  training session‚Äù WTS).  Analysis of compatible information elements between the coach‚Äôs and athlete‚Äôs SA highlighted differences in the frequency of categories between training sessions and competitions (see Fig. 2). The most frequent category overall practice conditions referred to technical elements. The athlete and his/her coach more frequently reported on similar technical elements during training sessions than competitions, and in PCTS than WTS, with the exception HT1 and his coach (see Table 3). In comparison to other categories of information elements, technical elements were more frequently similar between the athlete and his/her coach in hammer throwing than rowing. Psychological states were more frequently similar between the coach and his athlete in competition than training sessions. Organization and safety were seldom similar between the hammer thrower and his/her coach in training session and competition whereas they were frequently similar between the rower and his/her coach. Performance was more frequently similar in competition than training session, with the exception of HT2 and his coach. Athlete‚Äôs experience was seldom similar between each athlete and his/her coach.  3.3. Nature of the schemata containing information elements held by each athlete and his/her coach at each point in time  The analysis of the nature the schemata containing information elements held by the athlete and those held by his/her coach at each point in time showed whether they reported on the pheno- type schemata solely whether compared the phenotype with ge- notype schemata. The phenotype schemata was concerned with the athlete‚Äôs behavior, feeling, focus, thought, performance, and situation (e.g., Competition). Comparison between the phenotype and genotype schemata aimed to explain possible causes of athlete‚Äôs behavior and situation (e.g.,  76.5 m long‚Äù, HT2,  throw is  ‚Äúthe  ‚Äúshe gets up on her legs because she‚Äôs not anticipating and is keeping her left foot closed‚Äù HT3‚Äôs Coach, WTS; ‚Äúthe Ô¨Årst two turns are better  because the radius is longer‚Äù, HT1, WTS) and to assess whether the behavior being completed Ô¨Åtted the ideal/expected behavior to be completed (e.g., ‚Äúthe leg Ô¨Çexion is correct‚Äù, HT3, WTS). Analysis of the nature of information elements showed simi- larities and differences between the athletes and coaches (see Fig. 3). Information elements held by the athletes and coaches more frequently referred to the phenotype schemata solely, rather than a comparison between the phenotype and genotype schemata. In other words, they more frequently just described what happened,  Table 2 Frequency of information elements and their ratio according to session, and athlete‚Äôs and coach‚Äôs SA.

However, in comparison to athletes, coaches more frequently compared the phenotype with genotype schemata (see also Table 4).  4. Discussion  These results are discussed in relation to two sets of Ô¨Åndings related to coaching and collaborative work. The Ô¨Årst concerns the inÔ¨Çuence of the environment on the construction of the ‚Äúpicture‚Äù of the situation. The second concerns the inÔ¨Çuence of the individual on the construction of the ‚Äúpicture‚Äù.  4.1.  Evidence of SA directed externally towards the environment  As the Distributed Situation Awareness model predicts, infor- mation elements were related to the development of the situation over time. Results showed Ô¨Åve categories of information elements: (a) throw technical elements; (b) athlete‚Äôs psychological states; (c) organization and safety; (d) performance; and (e) athlete‚Äôs expe- rience. The present results suggest that athletes‚Äô and coaches‚Äô SA indicated a ‚Äúpicture‚Äù of the situation that was externally directed towards the environment and athlete, and adhered to the task goals and performance criteria, and is consistent with previous works on SA (e.g., Smith and Hancock, 1994) and DSA (e.g., Stanton et al., 2006).  Results showed that technical elements were the category most frequently reported and compatible between the athlete‚Äôs and coach‚Äôs SA. They highlighted the weight of technique in building up the ‚Äúpicture‚Äù. Elite athletes learn to improve their technique in order to achieve high-level performance. This learning consisted of adjustments to speciÔ¨Åc parts of behavior (e.g., increased leg Ô¨Çexion). Results suggest that SA was governed by a combination of the action that had been completed/was being undertaken, what was required to be achieved and what had been achieved in the previous action. Results also suggest that SA is mainly governed by the learning dimension. They are inconsistent with previous research on mutual understanding during training sessions within the coach-athlete dyad (Lorimer and Jowett, 2009a, 2009b, 2010, 2011). Previous research showed that mutual understanding dur- ing training sessions was largely based on the sharing of psycho- logical states with another person (i.e., feelings and thoughts). In the present results, athletes and coaches seldom mentioned ath- letes‚Äô psychological states during training sessions; they were more likely to comment on them during competition. Information elements concerning technical elements were more frequently reported and compatible in training sessions than competition, and in PCTS rather than WTS. In other words, athletes and coaches focused on technique to prepare for competitions and adjusted their preparation to what had happened in competition and previous training sessions, which is consistent with previous research concerning coaching (Macquet, 2010). In competition, although coaches and athletes mainly focused on technical elements, they also centered on athletes‚Äô psychological states and performance. Moreover, athletes more frequently  Table 3 Frequency of compatible information elements and their ratio according to session, and athlete‚Äôs and coach‚Äôs SA.

Competition is characterized by uncertainty of outcome and high stakes. Uncertainty and high stakes for athletes affect motivation, stress, self-conÔ¨Ådence, and athletes‚Äô behaviors (e.g., Wilson and Richards, 2011). This suggests that SA depends on the athlete and coach adaptation to the situa- tion‚Äôs changing external conditions. It also suggests greater coach empathy towards athletes during competition than training ses- sions. In competition the coach took into account changes in ath- letes‚Äô psychological states in order to help athlete to improve performance. Analysis of the relationships between DSA and per- formance would be a worthwhile avenue for future research. Information elements relating to organization and safety were more frequently reported and compatible in rowing than in hammer throwing. This suggests that SA depends on the context and conditions in which a sport is practiced. In rowing, conditions relate to wind, current, sense of navigation (looking forward for the coach and behind for the rower) and other boats navigating on the river; these were not as stable as in hammer throwing. These conditions inÔ¨Çuenced athletes, who had to take them into account in order to navigate safely and effectively. These results suggest that SA requirements differ according to sport and the conditions in which it is practiced (e.g., rowing on a river or a rowing machine). Although hammer throwing and rowing are both technical sports and correct technique is necessary for good performance, the conditions in which they are practiced might inÔ¨Çuence SA re- quirements. Analysis of SA requirements across sports would seem a worthwhile avenue for future research.  4.2.  Evidence of SA directed internally towards the individual  As the Distributed Situation Awareness model predicts (e.g., Stanton et al., 2006), and schema theory would predict (Plant and Stanton, 2013), the athletes and coaches possessed unique but compatible portions of awareness. They did not always understand the elements of the situation in exactly the same way. They might have had different pieces of information, or made different sense of them depending on their role, task, and experience. Results showed that the athletes commented more frequently than the coaches on behavior and situation (see the frequency of information elements in relation to meaningful units in Table 2). For example, the hammer throwers commented more on organi- zation and safety (e.g., cleaning their shoes before entering the circle) when preparing to throw than their coach. Results showed that, on the one hand, coaches mainly focused on technical ele- ments during training sessions and competitions, and athletes‚Äô  psychological states and performance during competitions; on the other hand, although athletes mainly focused on technical ele- ments during training sessions and competitions, they also centered on their psychological states, performance and organiza- tion and safety in practice conditions. These results suggest that the coach‚Äôs role within the team consists of observing and advising the athlete on improving his/her technique and coping with difÔ¨Åcult situations to maximize performance, whereas the athlete‚Äôs role consists of carrying out actions using a speciÔ¨Åc technique and, at the same time, taking into account his/her psychological states, organization and safety, performance, and making sense of all the parameters. Coaches train several athletes over a long period and thus have wide experience whereas the athlete trains him/herself and has developed ‚Äúself-centered experience‚Äù. These different roles and experience seem to govern SA development and the way the athlete and coach understand a situation differently. They might also explain how some information elements were different between the athlete and coach and some others were compatible. Results suggest that coach‚Äôs and athlete‚Äôs SA is considered as a whole combined experience. The connections people experience (i.e., data in the frame) are different. So, whilst they may share data, the connections of data-in-the-frame (i.e., schema) are different. From a practical perspective, it seems important to ensure that the coach‚Äôs and athlete‚Äôs portions of SA are compatible. This should help them to get compatible views of the situation. Compatible SA should allow them to focus on common elements of performance, moving to cognitive joint perspective and being on the same common ground (Clark, 1996). This compatibility could be improved by transaction (i.e., exchange of information between the coach and athlete) according to the DSA model. Exploring trans- actions would be a worthwhile avenue for future research in sports and other contexts. Finally, results showed the nature of information elements held by the coaches and athletes, namely the phenotype and genotype schemata. Results highlighted that coaches more frequently compared the phenotype with genotype schemata than athletes, meaning they more frequently explained the possible causes of athlete‚Äôs behavior and situation than athletes. This suggests that the coaches and athletes used their own schemata to describe and make sense of athlete‚Äôs behavior, feelings, thoughts and situation. They used different schemata (i.e., phenotype and genotype) because of their different experiences and roles within the team. The athlete who was expected to undertake a particular action, rather used phenotype schemata to describe what he/she did and

These results are consistent with the DSA model: partners‚Äô roles and experience governed SA and gave them unique but compatible portions of awareness. Limited research has pro- vided evidence of identiÔ¨Åcation of the phenotype and genotype schemata (Stanton et al., 2009), and to our knowledge, no research has provided evidence of differences in the use of phenotype and genotype schemata among team members. The present study, however, showed that 14% of the athletes‚Äô information elements referred to a comparison between the phenotype and genotype schemata, whereas 39% of the coaches‚Äô information elements referred to. The method developed by Macquet (2013) and supplemented in the present study seems useful for the study of DSA. As a post-event method (Sorensen and Stanton, 2012) it allows comparison of the consistency of athlete‚Äôs and coach‚Äôs SA and shows what governs SA within a cognitive joint system. Like the method developed by the DSA model, it allows modeling of system awareness and informa- tion elements underlying SA. In contrast to the method developed  by the DSA model, however, it provides the frequency of categories of information elements (macro information elements) held by each participant and those which are compatible between the coach‚Äôs and athlete‚Äôs SA in different situations (training sessions and competitions). It also highlights the nature of information el- ements, namely the genotype and phenotype schemata held by each participant depending on his/her role, experience, and com- petencies. In contrast to the DSA method and to be comprehensible by non-experts, it does not describe the micro-information ele- ments. However, even though we did not describe this, it offers the opportunity to categorize micro information elements. For example, different kinds of technical elements such as speed, rhythm, and amplitude could be categorized. These different cate- gories (i.e., macro and micro information elements) might be useful in highlighting what coaches and athletes focus on as they work on technique. Some limitations of this study should be noted. Firstly, the method has been developed for small samples. Its use to study larger samples, including sport, surgery, and military teams would be a worthwhile avenue for future research on collaborative sys- tems. Secondly, it did not feature non-expert athletes and short coacheathlete relationships. Thus, the extent to which coach‚Äôs and  
A.-C. Macquet, N.A. Stanton / Applied Ergonomics 45 (2014) 724e733  733  non-expert athlete‚Äôs SA with different relationship durations, are similar or identical is unknown. Thirdly, the study featured only two technical sports (i.e., hammer throwing and rowing) and it could be argued that the results presented here are not represen- tative of other sports, athletes and coaches. It would be of interest to study DSA with coaches and athletes from different levels, relationship durations, and sports (i.e., ‚Äòtechnical sports‚Äô and ‚Äòstra- tegic sports‚Äô), and DSA with teammates in team sports.  5.  Conclusion  Coaches and athletes were shown to possess some common ground, but also some important differences within their SA. The awareness was directed externally towards the environment and internally, towards the individual, depending on his/her role. The investigation showed that the schemata used to ‚Äòframe‚Äô the infor- mation elements were different, but compatible, between athlete and coach. The continuing study of DSA in domains such as hammer throwing and rowing will extend our understanding of collaborative systems in sports as well as in other domains char- acterized by collaboration and cooperation under conditions of uncertainty and complexity.

s0003687013002068,"  Although the demands of work have changed from physical to more mental demands in recent decades (Frese, 2000; Sutela, 2007), there are still branches where the physical demands are heavy. Food manufacturing is an example of such branches where the work still includes a lot of lifting and carrying, repetitive movements and other heavy physical load. The work environment of the food processing industry is also characterized by low and high temperatures, draught, noise and poor lighting which are risk factors for early cessation of working life, especially in that industry (Salonen et al., 2003). Additionally, in many situations the envi- ronmental factors and physical factors may act independently or collectively as stressors (LaDou, 2007). As a result, repetitive strain injuries are the most prevalent work-related diseases in the food processing industry in Finland (Riihim√§ki et al., 2004). Industrial workers are most exposed to job strain (Nicot, 2007). The high job strain is mostly due to the physical work environment in the industry. Several other studies have reported that physical working conditions, especially heavy lifting and uncomfortable  * Corresponding author.

Neupane).  work postures are associated with sick-leave (Laaksonen et al., 2010; Lund et al., 2006; Allebeck and Mastekaasa, 2004). Conse- quently, the risk for sick leaves and early retirement is typically increased in such working conditions (Ilmarinen et al., 1997; Nyg√•rd et al., 2005; Sell, 2009). Food industry workers have been shown to have twice as much sick leave as the average among in- dustry workers in Finland and the EU (Ilmarinen, 1999; Vahtera and Kivim√§ki, 2004; Gimeno et al., 2004). The branch is also at the top of the early retirement statistics (Salonen et al., 2003; Ilmarinen et al., 1997). Our study was based on a four-year follow-up of stress and strain in four food processing factories. The stress-strain concept (Rutenfrantz, 1981; Cox et al., 2000) assumes that the stress on a worker depends on objective environmental factors acting upon the person, whereas strain denotes the effects of stress which will be individually different. The use of the stress-strain concept is practical in the study of the effect of physical workload on the cardiovascular system which is directly related to the individual‚Äôs physical work capacity (Rutenfrantz, 1981). It also emphasizes the role of individual characteristics such as age, gender, and health status and work ability as modiÔ¨Åers of the relationship between physical working condition and strain. Work ability is a comprehensive concept for occupational health research and prevention (Ilmarinen, 2009). The relationship between the physical strain and heart rate depends on the type of muscular  0003-6870/$ e see front matter √ì 2013 Elsevier Ltd and The Ergonomics Society.

Heart rate at a given physical strain is the highest in industrial work that also includes much static work (Ilmarinen, 1978). Moreover, the associations of work stressors and individual stress symptoms with work ability are unclear: there seems to be a strong effect in particular among the aging (Tuomi et al., 1991), but there are also studies (Gamperiene et al., 2008) that have not found a relation between physical strain and work ability. Also, the physical working conditions among younger and older workers are poorly understood, as some previous research concluded that in the same occupation younger workers are at greater risk of physical strain than older workers (Pailhe, 2005). But the subjects of the aforementioned study were not only the blue-collar but also the others who were working in different job settings. Another study by Nyg√•rd et al. (1997) reported higher strain among older municipal employees in both blue- and white-collar jobs. Although many studies have previously assessed the associa- tion between work environment and strain, the association be- tween changes in physical working conditions and parallel changes in perceived strain has rarely been studied before. One of the experimental study found that physical capacity is adversely affected by mental stress (Mehta and Agnew, 2012) and that also mental stress adversely affect biomechanical responses during low back exertion (Marras et al., 2000). Our study is an original contribution to studies of the links between physical working conditions and perceived strain among food industries workers. We hypothesized in this study among industrial blue-collar workers that; a) deteriorating (negative changes) of the physical working condition increases the perceived physical and mental strain among younger and older workers and b) the perceived mental and physical strain interact with each other among younger and older workers.  2. Method  2.1.  Study subjects  The study subjects were employees from four factories and from one ofÔ¨Åce department of a food industry company employing more than 2000 people in Finland. Food processing is a universal industry, employing substantial number of workforce, e.g. in Finland, 34,000 workers (1e2% of the workforce) (Neupane et al., 2013a). The questionnaires were distributed in the workplaces, Ô¨Ålled in during working hours, and the closed response envelopes were collected and sent to the researchers. A questionnaire survey was conducted among all employees of the company in spring 2003 (N ¬º 1995, 1581 blue-collar and 414 white collar employees) with a response rate of 56% (N ¬º 1220). Of the respondents, 71% (N ¬º 861, 603 blue-collar and 258 white- collar employees) gave consent to being identiÔ¨Åed. The majority  of the blue-collar employees were working in food processing and maintenance departments, which entails muscular work with a lot of lifting and carrying, while majority of white-collar employees worked in the management department (Neupane et al., 2013a, 2013b). The 603 blue-collar employees are the cohort of interest in the present study. In a corresponding survey in 2007, 126 of them were no longer in the service of the com- pany; among those who had not resigned, the response rate was 52% (N ¬º 248). Their mean age at the beginning of the follow-up was 39 years (SD ¬º 9.5) ranging from 20 to 60 years, and 70% of them were women which is similar to European statistics where food manufacturing blue-collar workers are mainly female dominated (Eurofound, 2012). Statistics on sample attrition revealed that non-respondents were somewhat younger than the other groups, there was no gender difference, and the working conditions at baseline tended to be worse among those who had resigned between the surveys visits (Table 1). The study was approved by the ethical committee of Pirkanmaa Hospital Dis- trict, Tampere, Finland.  2.2. Measurement of strain  Perceived mental strain was assessed by a modiÔ¨Åed version of the occupational stress questionnaire (Elo et al., 1992), using a single question (‚ÄúStress means a situation in which a person feels excited, apprehensive/concerned, nervous or distressed or she/he cannot sleep because of the things on her/his mind. Do you feel this kind of stress nowadays?‚Äù) (Elo et al., 1992), with the reply scale from 0 (not at all) to10 (very much). Perceived physical strain was elicited with the rating of perceived exertion (RPE) with the ques- tion ‚ÄúHow physically hard/exhausting do you feel your job is on a normal work day?‚Äù on a scale from 6 (not at all) to 20 (very much) (Borg, 1970) Box 1.  2.3. Measurement of physical working conditions  Factors in the physical working condition were asked by the question ‚ÄúDo the following factors increase your strain at your work? draught, noise, poor indoor climate, hotness, coldness and blinding lighting‚Äù on a scale going from 1 (very little) to 5 (very much) (Lehto and Sutela, 2009). In our study, the variable describing environmental factors was summed into a single vari- able ranging from 6 to 30. In a similar way, the variable describing physical working conditions (restless work environment, repeti- tive movements, bent or twisted working postures) was asked in a scale 1 (very little) to 5 (very much) and the answers summed up into a variable ranging from 3 to 15 (Virtanen et al., 2008). The Cronbach‚Äôs alpha from the reliability test of the sum measures for physical working condition was 0.80 and environmental factors were 0.78.  
588  Box 1  Details of perceived exertion (RPE) scale  S. Neupane et al.  / Applied Ergonomics 45 (2014) 586e591  Perceived exertion is the single best indicator of the degree  of physical strain (Borg, 1970). The perceived exertion (RPE)  scale values range from 6 to 20 and can be used to denote  heart rates ranging from 60 to 200 beats/min. This scale is  easier to use because a certain value on the scale, e.g. 13,  would match approximately a heart rate of 130 beats/min for 30e50-year-old subjects.  Details of the scale:  6 e No exertion at all 7 e Extremely light 8 e 9 e Very light 10 e 11 e Light 12 e 13 e Somewhat hard 14 e Hard (heavy) 15 e 16 e Very hard 17 e 18 e 19 e Extremely hard 20 e Maximal exertion  2.4. Measurement of work ability  The single-item question, in this study concerned one item from the work ability index (WAI) ‚Äúcurrent work ability compared with the life time best‚Äù with a possible score of 0 (absolutely incapable to work) to 10 (work ability at its best) (Ilmarinen, 2009; de Croon et al., 2005).  2.5.  Statistical analysis  Changes of the physical working conditions as well as change in the mental and physical strain during follow-up were calculated by subtracting the values of the year 2003 from the values of the year 2007. Descriptive statistics of physical strain, mental strain, work ability, physical working conditions and environmental ex- posures in the cohort were performed in means and standard deviation (SD) stratiÔ¨Åed by age. Distributions of the change from the year 2003e2007 were shown as means and standard  deviations. Paired samples t-test was used to test the signiÔ¨Åcance of the changes of all outcome variable and determinant variables at baseline and the follow-up year. Associations between changes in physical working conditions and environmental factors with the changes in mental and physical strain were Ô¨Årst studied with Spearman‚Äôs correlation coefÔ¨Åcients. Then multifactorial analysis was conducted using linear regressions with enter method (pro- cedure for the multivariable regression analysis) by adjusting for each independent variable by age, gender, changes in work ability and baseline factors (perceived work ability, physical working conditions, and environmental factors, physical and mental strain) in the model. All the analyses were divided into two age groups <45 years (young) and 45 years (old), (WHO, 1993) to analyze the association separately among younger and older workers. Statistical analyses were performed by SPSS for Windows version 16.0.2. P-values under 0.05 were considered as statistical signiÔ¨Åcant.  3. Results  Perceived environmental factors signiÔ¨Åcantly (p < 0.01) dete- riorated among the younger workers but improved among the older workers (p < 0.01) (Table 2). As regards the outcome vari- ables, mental strain had increased signiÔ¨Åcantly (p ¬º 0.02) among younger workers and the changes in physical strain were not sig- niÔ¨Åcant. Work ability decreased among the older (0.04), whereas no changes were seen among the younger workers. Perceived mental and physical strain and working conditions among younger workers was higher than their older counterparts in both baseline and follow-up year. Changes in physical strain correlated positively with the changes in mental strain in both age groups; the correlation was (p ¬º 0.02), statistically signiÔ¨Åcant and was particularly strong among the older workers (Table 3). The correlation between changes in physical strain and changes in mental strain and phys- ical working conditions was signiÔ¨Åcant among both younger and older workers. The changes in physical strain correlated signiÔ¨Å- cantly with the changes in environmental factors among young workers. Table 4 shows the unstandardized b e coefÔ¨Åcients with 95% conÔ¨Ådence intervals, R2 and p-values for age, gender, changes in work ability and baseline factors adjusted linear regression models. The change in mental strain was linearly associated with the change in physical strain among younger workers (p ¬º 0.02) and also with the changes in physical working conditions among both younger and older workers. However, the signiÔ¨Åcant factors explained the low variance of the change, which is from 5 to 9%.

For the change in physical strain due to signiÔ¨Åcant factors was comparatively low as well and ranged from 6 to 14%. Positive change in mental strain explained positive change of physical strain among younger employees but the effect was nearly signiÔ¨Åcant among older ones.  4. Discussion  The result of this study supports our Ô¨Årst hypothesis partly; deteriorating physical working conditions increases perceived physical and mental strain. We found (in this study) an association between deteriorating physical working conditions and increased physical strain among both the young and the older workers, whereas the associations of environmental factors with perceived mental and physical strain proved out as non-signiÔ¨Åcant except for the association with physical strain among younger workers. Moreover, our analysis revealed that the change in physical strain was associated with the change in mental strain, especially among younger workers, which conÔ¨Årmed our second hypothesis. Due to the limited number of earlier studies looking into the parallel changes in physical and mental strain, a meaningful comparison with the results of the present study is warrant. The last Ô¨Ånding is noteworthy: it indicates that among the younger workers an increase of poor physical working conditions  not only increased physical strain but also increased mental strain. A possible explanation could be that the older people are less exposed than their younger colleagues to the most adverse physical factors in the workplace, such as physical strain, vibrations, extreme temperatures, etc. (Agathocleous, 2004). In our study, the prevalence of mental strain at baseline was 18.1% while at follow- up it was increased by 7% (data not shown). Our results are com- parable with the results of the study by Sein et al. (2010) among rubber-glove factory workers in Thailand which found that the prevalence of job strain was 27.5%. Stress factors (physical working environment) were found to predict future strain in personnel on ships that can have adverse effect one year later (Bridger et al., 2011). Risk due to physical working conditions such as poor phys- ical working conditions at work in Finland is above EU27 average and exposures to poor physical working conditions in industrial sector are also high compared to other industrial sector (Eurofound, 2012). Some researchers also assume that environmental condi- tions may be the prime cause of increasing mental strain (Cooper and Roden, 1985). For older employees the actual working method applied may be considered as an important instrument in order to compensate for increasing strain and declining work ability and also an increase in mental strain. In our study working conditions are the factor that can affect physiological strain. In particular, an increase in heat stress results in an increase in heart rate, even during rest. In blue-collar occupation in the food in- dustry, workers are exposed to a wide range of ambient conditions. Thus, monitoring of physiological strain is important as it reÔ¨Çects both the effect of physical work but also the strain provided by any  Table 4 Associations of the change of mental or physical strain, change of physical factors and environmental factors for change of mental and physical strain from 2003 to 2007 separately for workers under 45 and older than 45 years.

Furthermore, physical capacity deteriorates earlier with age than mental capacity (Nyg√•rd et al., 2005; Savinainen et al., 2004). Mental capacity may also decline in middle age, but this seldom occurs before the age of 65, and even thereafter the drop is individual and depends partly on how much mental stimulation an individual receives. It is very important to notice in the female dominated food factory branch that women are more sensitive to environmental factors, and tend to perceive their health problems more intensely, and to report more problems than men do (Verbrugge, 1985). In a study by Tuomi et al. (1991) people over 45 years working in jobs with high physical demands, poor physical environment and poor work postures were physically more stressed than people in jobs with mental or mixed mental and physical demands. This may be explained by the fact that older employees may be more sen- sitive to changes in the environment than younger employees and also due to a decline in capacity and work ability with increasing age. In another study (Myrtek et al., 1999) it has been postulated that blue-collar workers are subjected to higher physical workload than white-collar workers but the latter are subjected to higher mental workload (Nerell and Wahlund, 1981). In this study too, physical factors were found to be an important tool for changing mental and physical strain among both younger and older workers. By contrast, perceived workloads of the aged and young construc- tion workers and vehicle inspectors (blue-collar workers) were not age dependent (Louhevaara, 1999). Kalimo and Mejman (1987) showed that exposure to adverse physical conditions in the working environment plays a role in shaping the psychosocial environment, and quite often the exis- tence of such adverse conditions leads to poor health. In another study by Rusli et al. (2008) found that poor working conditions were associated to the higher self-perceptions of stress and depression. In our study too, increase of physical working condi- tions for e.g. uncomfortable work posture and repetitive work task was positively correlated to changes in physical strain. One study among rubber glove factory workers in Thailand found the preva- lence of high strain was associated with psychosocial working conditions (Sein et al., 2010). The employees in the food factory often stand for long periods and may be required to lift heavy ob- jects or use cutting, slicing, grinding, and other dangerous tools and machines, which may be physically more demanding. In occupa- tions with comparable work demands for all employees, individual differences e.g. in actual working methods may Ô¨Ånally result in a variation in the working postures (Burdorf, 1992; Kilbom and Persson, 1987) and add to the strain. The high physical strain among the food industry workers must be noted. Physical strain had not changed during follow-up despite possible technical changes in the working environment intended to improve the physical working conditions during the follow-up years, for instance modernization of the production lines. Howev- er, detailed registration of changes e.g. in the product lines was not done in the present study. Thus, awareness of physical risk factors is important, in particular because food processing work includes many females and older workers. One recent study concluded that the perception of female and male of their work environment differed signiÔ¨Åcantly in magnitude and occasionally in direction (Brunette et al., 2011). Generally females perceive higher physical strain than men in the same kind of work (Nyg√•rd et al., 1997). Male workers in manufacturing and construction are much more likely to be regularly exposed to physical risk than women in these sec- tors (Eurofound, 2012). Among blue-collar female workers a decrease in functional capacity may occur especially after the age of 45 years (Savinainen et al., 2004; Nyg√•rd et al., 1988). It has been shown in an earlier study (Nyg√•rd et al., 1997) that older employees experience higher strain than younger employees. By contrast,  Pailhe (2005) reported that younger cohorts are exposed to phys- ical strain more frequently than older cohorts. However, the pre- sent study also showed higher perceived physical strain among younger employees than their older counterparts. Also, for the similar occupational group, perceived high strain was more prev- alent among females than males irrespective of age (Butler et al., 2005). In this study, the employees showed on average relatively good work ability (Gould et al., 2008). However, it was appropriate to adjust the regression analyses for work ability, as stress may be associated with higher strain when work ability is low, according to the theoretical model of our study. Relatively good work ability can also be explained by the healthy worker effect in this relatively tough branch of industry. The strength of the study is a four-year follow-up of the popu- lation in a prospective design where we could follow up the changes in individuals and the changes in the work environment and their relationships. Moreover, some variables e.g. work ability was measured by single questions, asking respondents to range their current work ability on 5- or 10-point Likert scale which is one of the commonly used methods (Bobko, 2002). Due to the theo- retical complexity and practical issues, the single-item question on work ability has often replaced e.g. the WAI in clinical work and research (Sluiter and Frings-Dresen, 2008). In our survey we used a single-item question to measure physical working conditions which have already been used in scientiÔ¨Åc research since 1977 in Statistics Finland (Lehto and Sutela, 2009; Virtanen et al., 2008). The study concerned only the food processing industry, and the speciÔ¨Åc environment homogenous employee group and longitu- dinal setting are one of the strengths of the study but this may also limit the generalization of the results. This study may have some bias because all the information regarding mental and physical strain and perception of physical working conditions were collected by questionnaire, i.e. no objec- tive measurements for the physical working condition were carried out. Response rate for the Ô¨Årst survey was satisfactory; while, it considerably improved at follow-up to 71%. The respondents who participated in the baseline survey but did not answer at follow-up (N ¬º 430) were involved in both blue and white-collar professions, may cause systematic underestimations and bias the association between exposure and outcome. The selection during the follow- up might also have affected our results: the drop-out subjects were relatively young and more exposed to poor working condi- tions, and this may have reduced the amount of variance explained. Furthermore, it is likely that the low correlations and explained variances were attributed to the adjustments for the model, which means that the covariates in the regression models were actually the main explained factors for the changes in mental and physical strain. Selection out of the workforce is more likely to occur among the workers with most health problems, as well as the highest exposure levels, leaving healthiest workers at the workplaces and being selected in cohort studies as ours. Such biases diminish the associations between workplace exposures and health outcomes. There is a need for future research with corresponding design, as other types of workplaces may pose different challenges to the physical environment and different physical environment-strain interaction. Despite the low level of changes in the work factors (physical and environmental), increases in mental or physical strain were found to be signiÔ¨Åcantly correlated with increases in the work factors (i.e. poorer working conditions) after adjusting for age, gender, and several baseline work factors related to work ability and working conditions. Deteriorated physical working conditions were associated with high mental and physical strain of the em- ployees and this could ultimately lead to early retirement or higher

s0003687013002081,"  Musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) commonly affect nurses (Harcombe et al., 2009; Long et al., 2012; Smith et al., 2004), possibly due to the strenuous workload (Baptiste, 2011; Heiden et al., 2013) and irregular shift schedule that are an integral part of nursing (Caruso and Waters, 2008). The Ô¨Ånancial consequences of MSDs are substantial and the direct cost of low back pain in Switzerland accounts for 6.1% of total health care expenses (Wieser et al., 2011). MSDs have a detrimental effect on occupational and private activities and thereby reduce quality of life (Scuffham et al., 2010). This might explain the relatively short careers of Swiss nurses, who work for an average of only 13.5 years in nursing (Dolder and Gr√ºnig, 2009). The most common MSDs in nurses are low back and neck pain. The prevalence of neck pain is between 50 and 60% (Harcombe et al., 2009; Warming et al., 2009), and a prevalence of even 83% has been reported (Long et al., 2012). Several studies have reported  * Corresponding author.

The commonly used method to evaluate trapezius muscle activity is surface electromyography (EMG, Mathiassen et al., 1995). The most important determinant for neck pain was reported to be a lack of rest time, demonstrated by no periods without measurable activity in EMG (Hagg and Astrom, 1997; Veiersted et al., 1993). This concept is based on the so-called Cinderella hypothesis (Hagg, 1991) which states that during a prolonged low-level activity the same muscle Ô¨Åbers are always active. Such prolonged low-level activities are frequently observed in the trapezius muscle (Ostensvik et al., 2009). If rest time is lacking, these so-called Cinderella Ô¨Åbers may become overloaded (Hagg, 1991). Early histological studies of trapezius muscle found changes at the cellular level in subjects suffering from neck pain (Lindman et al., 1991). Newer studies found evidence for the mal- functioning of single muscle cells (Sjogaard et al., 2010) but addi- tional mechanisms, such as sensitization, are also assumed to play a role (Visser and van Dieen, 2006). The discussed insufÔ¨Åcient rest time is strongly correlated with the type of workload and mental stress and neck pain was shown to be correlated with shift work (Elfering et al., 2008; Farina et al., 2008; L√§ubli and M√ºller, 2009). The type of workload has an effect on prolonged periods of low- level activity. During a variable load the trapezius muscle demon- strates a shift of activity (Falla and Farina, 2007), while no shift of  0003-6870/$ e see front matter √ì 2013 Elsevier Ltd and The Ergonomics Society.

Without a shift of activity and if the duration is long enough overexertion results (Farina et al., 2008). During standardized stress tasks in laboratory experiments, Sjogaard et al. (2010) reported higher EMG levels in females with trapezius myalgia compared to females without myalgia, and the relative load was higher in females with trapezius myalgia. In an earlier study where assessments were conducted at the subjects‚Äô work places using the same case deÔ¨Ånitions, Larsson et al. (2008) found no difference in EMG measurements between cases and controls. The authors suggested that under normal working con- ditions at the actual workplace, cases and controls work at the same relative load, leading to the same strain for cases and controls. Mental stress increases the activity of the trapezius muscle (Nimbarte et al., 2012) and is suggested to cause prolonged low- level activity of muscles which prevents muscle relaxation and regeneration of the allostatic system (Sjogaard et al., 2000). Elfering et al. (2008) found a correlation between MSDs and the stress hormones epinephrine and norepinephrine. Time pressure also causes higher levels of trapezius muscle activity (Birch et al., 2000). Rotating shift work is a well-known risk to health (Conway et al., 2008; Costa, 1996) and the associated health risks are assumed to be caused by a disruption of the circadian rhythm (Bonde et al., 2012). Estryn-Behar et al. (2008) showed that nurses working shifts that included night shifts demonstrated a higher risk of burnout than nurses not working night shifts, while nurses with regular day work or shift work excluding night shifts did not differ for this risk. L√§ubli and M√ºller (2009) showed an association be- tween night shifts and MSDs. In addition, shift work increases the risk of work-family conÔ¨Çict (Camerino et al., 2010), which in turn is associated with neck pain (Hammig et al., 2011; Kim et al., 2013). The aim of the present study was to investigate physical work- load and trapezius muscle activity during night and day shifts and their association with neck pain and mental well-being at work in nurses. Based on the burden associated with the disruption in the circadian rhythm and the fact that in Switzerland nursing staff is reduced during night shifts, we assumed that night shifts would be associated with more burden than day shifts. Therefore, we hy- pothesized that workload and trapezius muscle activity would be greater during night than day shifts and that night shifts would be associated with more neck pain and worse mental well-being at work.  2.

s0003687013002159,"  The data from the Liberty Mutual Safety Index (Liberty Mutual Research Institute for Safety, 2012) showed that costs for disabling workplace injuries in 2010 due to falls on the same level in the US were estimated to be approximately 8.61 billion US dol- lars or 16.9% of the total cost burden. The same data also showed that while the overall costs of disabling workplace injuries decreased 4.7% between 1998 and 2010, after adjusting for inÔ¨Ça- tion, the cost of falls on the same level increased by 42.3% over the same period. Therefore, falls on the same level are a serious prob- lem in occupational injuries. As summarized by Chang et al. (2001b), friction plays an important role in injuries triggered by underfoot slips that could result in falls. The maximum coefÔ¨Åcient of friction (COF) that can be supported at the shoe and Ô¨Çoor interface without a slip is usually called the available coefÔ¨Åcient of friction (ACOF) for  * Corresponding author.

The minimum COF needed at the shoe and Ô¨Çoor interface to support human locomotion is called the required coefÔ¨Åcient of friction (RCOF). A slip may occur when the RCOF for an activity exceeds the ACOF at the shoe and Ô¨Çoor interface (Redfern et al., 2001). Hanson et al. (1999) devel- oped a logistic regression model to estimate the probability of a fall in which actual fall incidents in a laboratory environment were related to the differences between the means of the RCOF and ACOF. BurnÔ¨Åeld and Powers (2006) adopted a similar approach to investigate the probability of falls using a different slipmeter from the one used by Hanson et al. to measure the ACOF. In these two studies, the probability of slip incidents was predicted based on the differences between the means of the RCOF and ACOF without considering the contributions from their variations and potential dependency on the materials and con- ditions used. A statistical model was developed to compare the ACOF and RCOF in estimating the probability of a slip or fall incident (Chang, 2004). A stochastic distribution was assumed in this model for both the ACOF (pa) and RCOF (pr) as shown in Fig. 1. According to Chang (2004), the cumulative probability for the RCOF (mr) to exceed the ACOF (ma) is  0003-6870/$ e see front matter √ì 2013 Elsevier Ltd and The Ergonomics Society.

In addition to differences in the mean values for the estimate of slip probability as used by Hanson et al. (1999) and BurnÔ¨Åeld and Powers (2006), this statistical model demonstrated, as illustrated by Chang (2004), that the variations in the RCOF and ACOF could also contribute to the probability of a slip. Therefore, the estimate of the probability of a slip or fall incident may be improved by using stochastic distributions for the RCOF and ACOF with consideration of the difference between their means as well as their variations. A better understanding of the stochastic distribution of the RCOF and ACOF will help improve the inputs to the statistical model that could better predict slip probability. Chang et al. (2008, 2012b) recently reported an investigation on the stochastic distribution of the RCOF. Their results showed that the RCOF distribution for each individual under each walking condition had a slightly larger number of cases that had a good match with the normal distribution (85.5%) than the log-normal (84.5%) and Weibull (81.5%) distributions. Therefore, among three distributions evaluated, the normal distribution was a preferred representation for the RCOF with additional beneÔ¨Åts of its simplicity, practicality and familiarity. However, in few cases (7.75%), none of the three distributions was a good match for the RCOF. Mechanical devices, also called slipmeters, are usually used to measure the ACOF which always has random variations even when identical samples are used (Chang and Matz, 2001). In addition, variations in friction can result from measurements with different samples of identical Ô¨Çoor and shoe materials, as shown by Chang and Matz (2001). Therefore, the ACOF is not a constant for a particular shoe and Ô¨Çoor interface, but has a stochastic distribution. Barnett (2002) and Marpet (2002) discussed the concept of a sto- chastic distribution of the ACOF. Barnett (2002) reported that the distribution of the ACOF was near a Weibull distribution from 400 measurements of the ACOF over 100 new asphalt tiles under dry conditions with the Horizontal Pull Slipmeter (HPS). Despite these preliminary examinations of the stochastic dis- tributions of the ACOF, the published results are very limited in Ô¨Çoor types and surface conditions evaluated. Most slip incidents occur on surfaces with contamination where the ACOF could be low and the probability of a slip incident could be higher than under dry conditions. The stochastic distribution of the ACOF could depend on  W.-R. Chang et al.  / Applied Ergonomics 45 (2014) 811e815  the Ô¨Çoor surfaces and surface conditions. Chang et al. (2012a) re- ported a preliminary study on the ACOF of quarry tiles under three surface conditions of dry, water and glycerol. They reported that the ACOF under the glycerol condition had a good match with all three continuous distributions, the normal, lognormal and Weibull, while the ACOF under wet condition had a good match with the normal and lognormal distributions. They further reported that the ACOF under the dry condition did not have a good match with any of the three distributions. The goal of the current study was to expand the investigation of the stochastic distributions of the ACOF by adding four more different Ô¨Çoor surfaces under the dry, water and glycerol contaminated conditions as an input to the statistical model. These Ô¨Åve different Ô¨Çoor materials were selected out of 37 commonly used Ô¨Çoor materials in a previous study due to their distinctive features that represented different combinations of friction levels and cognitive elements (Lesch et al., 2008). Since most slip in- cidents occur on contaminated surfaces, investigating the ACOF distributions on surfaces covered with water and glycerol is critical.  2. Method  As a part of a larger study, Ô¨Åve walkways of approximately 6.1 m long and 81.3 cm wide were constructed. Each walkway was covered with a speciÔ¨Åc Ô¨Çoor tile. The Ô¨Åve Ô¨Çoor types used in the experiment, referred to as Ô¨Çoor types A to E, were: (A) standard Ô¨Çat quarry tile, (B) a standard quarry tile with raised-proÔ¨Åled tread lines perpendicular to the walking direction, (C) vinyl composition sheet, (D) marble tile and (E) glazed porcelain tile. Detailed infor- mation about these Ô¨Çoor types is listed in Table 1. These Ô¨Åve Ô¨Çoor types with three different surface conditions (15 cases) provided a wide range of ACOF values. In contrast to friction measurements on uninstalled Ô¨Çoor tiles, measurements on installed tiles on walkways offered more realistic conditions that could potentially affect the ACOF values. Fifty tiles or locations along the walking path on each walkway were selected for friction measurements. Under each surface condition, two friction measurements were performed on each selected tile or location, one in each walking direction, for a total of 100 mea- surements. The portable inclinable articulated strut slip tester (PIAST), also known as the Brungraber Mark II, was used in this experiment. A standard test method for this slipmeter is published by the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) (ASTM F- 1677-05, 2005). The ACOF was measured under three different surface condi- tions: dry, water and 45% glycerol concentration. Clean paper towels were used to apply a solution of diluted 50% ethanol mixed with de-ionized water for cleaning the Ô¨Çoor surfaces before per- forming friction measurements. For the water condition, in order to help form a uniform water Ô¨Ålm over the surface, a wetting agent (Kodak Professional Photo-Flo 200 solution; Eastman Kodak Com- pany, Rochester, NY, USA) was added to the water with a 1 to 200 ratio by volume as suggested by its manufacturer.

It is sensitive to differences in both loca- tion and shape of the empirical cumulative distribution functions of the two distributions and also works for non-normally distributed data as well.  3. Results and discussion  The minimum, maximum, mean, standard deviation, skewness and kurtosis of the measured COF for each surface condition and Ô¨Çoor surface are shown in Table 2. The p values for the KolmogoroveSmirnov goodness-of-Ô¨Åt test for each surface condition and Ô¨Çoor surface are shown in Table 3. There is a statistically signiÔ¨Åcant difference or lack of Ô¨Åt between the distribution of the data with a given distribution when the p value of the goodness-of-Ô¨Åt test is less than 0.05. When the p value is greater than 0.05, there is no evidence of lack of Ô¨Åt, i.e., a good match. The results of the KolmogoroveSmirnov goodness-of-Ô¨Åt test indicated that the ACOF distribution appears to Ô¨Åt the normal and log-normal distributions under the water condition for the quarry tile, and all three distributions under dry condition for the porcelain tile as well as under the glycerol condition for the quarry tile. However, no match with a statistical signiÔ¨Åcance was found be- tween the distribution of ACOF and any of the three continuous distributions evaluated for the rest of the 12 out of 15 cases. The distributions of the data for each Ô¨Çoor type and surface condition that had a good match with any of the three continuous distributions with a statistical signiÔ¨Åcance are shown with the  was used to apply a Ô¨Åne water mist. As soon as a uniform layer of water was generated on the surface, judged by visual inspection, the process was terminated. For the glycerol condition, a paint roller was used to apply the contaminant of the mixture of 45% glycerol with water by weight. Liquid contaminant, such as water or glycerol, was replenished throughout repeated impacts on the Ô¨Çoor surface during a friction measurement on a contaminated surface. The ACOF was measured in this experiment with smooth Neolite test liners, a commonly used footwear material for slipmeter fric- tion measurements in the US. The material was cut into approxi- mately 7.6 by 7.6 cm squares to be attached to the test foot holder of the slipmeter as a footwear test pad. Before the Ô¨Årst measurement at each tile or location under each Ô¨Çoor surface condition, the surface of the Neolite pad was sanded using hand pressure with 400 grit silicon carbide abrasive paper. The sanding protocol described by Chang et al. (2012a) was used in this experiment. A brush was used to remove excess particles on the Neolite surface due to sanding. The sanding procedure was repeated until any visible scratches or dirt were removed from the Neolite surface. The PIAST is an inclined-strut slipmeter. During a measurement with this slipmeter, the operator systematically impacts the Ô¨Çoor with multiple strikes at different angles to determine the angle at which a non-slip becomes a slip. Only a fast movement was considered as a slip as described in Chang (2002). Instead of the scale of the slipmeter showing the angle, however, it shows only the COF reading, which represents the tangent of the acute angle between the normal to the Ô¨Çoor surface and the direction of impact. The procedure for operating this slipmeter becomes systematically impacting the Ô¨Çoor with this slipmeter at different COF readings, as shown on the scale that represents the impact angle, and looking for the COF reading at which a non-slip becomes a slip. The friction measurement should start at a low COF reading and increase by 0.05 as long as a non-slip persists, according to the protocol sug- gested by the manufacturer. Once a slip occurs, COF reading is reduced by 0.01 as long as the slip persists. The measurement is stopped at the next occurrence of a non-slip. The COF reading of the last slip is recorded as the result of the measurement. All the fric- tion measurements in this experiment were performed by one operator. For each surface condition and Ô¨Çoor surface, the Kolmogorove Smirnov goodness-of-Ô¨Åt test was used to determine whether the distribution of the ACOF had a good match with a commonly-used continuous distribution (normal, log-normal or Weibull). The Kol- mogoroveSmirnov test is one of the most useful and general nonparametric methods for comparing a sample with a reference  Table 2 Minimum, maximum, mean, standard deviation, skewness and kurtosis of the co- efÔ¨Åcient of friction for each surface condition and Ô¨Çoor type.

Chang et al.  / Applied Ergonomics 45 (2014) 811e815  by subtracting the minimum ACOF value from the maximum ACOF under the identical Ô¨Çoor type and surface condition within the data pool summarized in Table 2. Some cases in this study had a very small range in the ACOF such as the smooth quarry tile and marble under dry conditions, and the porcelain tile under wet and glycerol conditions. With a resolution of 0.01 in ACOF measurements, there was not enough variation in the data when the ACOF had a small range such as the example shown in Fig. 5, so the Kolmogorove Smirnov goodness-of-Ô¨Åt test was unable to carry out a proper comparison with this limitation. So, it appears that small values in skewness and kurtosis and a larger range seem to be the criteria for a good match with the normal distribution with a statistical sig- niÔ¨Åcance. By judging the results presented in Tables 2 and 3, most of the cases that did not have a good match with the normal distri- bution had a range of less than 0.15 and skewness and kurtosis more than 1.0. Therefore, the cases with skewness and kurtosis values less than 1.0 and a range more than 0.16 could have a good match with the normal distribution. However, there was an exception. The case of the ridged quarry tile under the glycerol skewness  0.3 and condition, which had a range of ACOF 0.31, kurtosis 0.4, did not have a good match with the normal distribu- tion according to the KolmogoroveSmirnov goodness-of-Ô¨Åt test, although the p value for this was 0.024, so it could be considered marginal for a match. The ACOF could be very close to zero with the presence of contaminants. Because the ACOF is not less than zero in practice, there could be a large number of the ACOF values around zero such as the marble wet and glycerol conditions. For those cases, none of the stochastic distributions could Ô¨Åt well. For the purpose of estimating slip probability, the stochastic distribution of the ACOF is compared with that of the RCOF. Chang et al. (2012b) collected a total of 30,968 successful strikes from 50 participants under four different walking conditions with standard quarry tiles (Floor type A) and footwear with Neolite as the heel material under dry conditions and reported the RCOF ranged from 0.112 to 0.413. Although the RCOF values are highly dependent on activities, the ACOF obtained in the current study could be compared with the RCOF obtained by Chang et al. (2012b) as an example. For practical purposes, one could assume that the ACOF is a constant represented by the mean value without signiÔ¨Åcantly affecting the estimate of slip probability when the ACOF is much lower or higher than the RCOF. Seven cases could be included in this category such as smooth quarry dry (0.84), quarry ridged dry (0.82), marble wet (0.002) and glycerol (0.001), vinyl dry (0.91), and por- celain wet (0.03) and glycerol (0.01).

In contrast, an ACOF distribu- tion that did not have a match with any of three distributions is shown in Fig. 5. The results reported by Chang et al. (2012b) showed that the distribution of the RCOF had a good match with the commonly used continuous distributions in a majority of cases. In particular, the RCOF distribution for each individual under each walking condition had a slightly larger number of cases that had a good match with the normal distribution (85.5%) than the log-normal (84.5%) and Weibull distributions (81.5%). Almost the opposite results were found for the ACOF. The results show that both the normal and log- normal distributions had a good match with the ACOF in only three out of 15 different cases evaluated, and the Weibull distribution had a good match with the ACOF in two cases. Similar to the RCOF distributions, the normal distribution could be used to represent the ACOF distribution in these cases due to its simplicity, practi- cality and familiarity compared with the log-normal and Weibull distributions. The RCOF is measured with a force plate under dry conditions and the value of the RCOF is usually non-zero and exists continu- ously over the range within the data pool, so the stochastic distri- butions could be used to represent the RCOF in most of the cases as shown by Chang et al. (2012b). With the protocol for the PIAST used in this experiment, the ACOF could only be measured in increments of 0.01; therefore, the slipmeter output could not resolve any dif- ferences in the ACOF less than 0.01. The ACOF range was obtained  Fig. 4. The stochastic distribution of the ACOF for dry condition on porcelain tile.  Fig. 5. The distribution of the ACOF for glycerol condition on marble tile.  
W.-R. Chang et al.  / Applied Ergonomics 45 (2014) 811e815  815  cases could be judged by their skewness and kurtosis values. The values of skewness and kurtosis could be used to determine if the ACOF distribution has a chance for a good match with the normal distribution. The kurtosis value has been reduced by three, so the normal distribution has a value of zero. A perfect normal distri- bution with zero skewness and kurtosis rarely occurs in real life. For the practical purpose of identifying a distribution close to a normal distribution, the standard error of skewness (SES) and the standard SES ¬º O(6/N) error of kurtosis (SEK) can be used where and SEK ¬º O(24/N), with N the sample size (Tabachnick and Fidell, 1996). If the skewness or kurtosis of the ACOF values is more than two times SES or SEK, respectively, they are probably skewed to a signiÔ¨Åcant degree. The sample size for each case was 100 in the current study, so SES ¬º 0.245 and SEK ¬º 0.490. Although they did not have a match with a normal distribution with a statistical sig- niÔ¨Åcance, quarry ridged wet and glycerol conditions could be considered as relatively close to a normal distribution for practical purposes since their skewness and kurtosis values do not exceed two times SES and SEK values, respectively. No representation was found in three cases out of 15, marble dry condition and vinyl wet and glycerol conditions. In the Ô¨Årst study on the stochastic distribution of the ACOF, Barnett (2002) reported that the distribution of the ACOF was near a Weibull distribution from 400 measurements of the ACOF over 100 new asphalt tiles under dry conditions with the Horizontal Pull Slipmeter (HPS). In our preliminary study with one Ô¨Çoor material (Chang et al., 2012a), we found that two cases (wet and glycerol) could be represented by the normal, log-normal and Weibull dis- tributions, but could not Ô¨Ånd a match for the dry condition. Without any further study, one might conclude that a good match with normal, log-normal or Weibull distribution exists in most of the cases. As we expanded the study from one Ô¨Çoor material to Ô¨Åve with continuation on dry, wet and glycerol conditions like that in Chang et al. (2012a) and 1500 measurements, we found that the distributions of most of the conditions actually could not have a match with these commonly used distributions with a statistical signiÔ¨Åcance. The results reported in the current manuscript certainly open up other possibilities that are far more complex than what had heretofore been reported. Under identical material combinations and test conditions, different slipmeters could produce very different ACOF values and different operators could produce different ACOF values with identical slipmeters (Chang et al., 2001a). The stochastic distribu- tions of the ACOF were evaluated under three surface conditions using Ô¨Åve different Ô¨Çoor materials in this experiment. More eval- uations should be done regarding the stochastic distributions of the ACOF considering factors such as different slipmeters, operators, material combinations and surface conditions.  4.  Conclusions  Based on the data evaluated in the current study, both the normal and log-normal distributions had a good match with the ACOF in three out of 15 different cases evaluated and the Weibull distribution had a good match with the ACOF in two cases. The normal distribution could be used to represent the ACOF distribu- tion in these cases due to its simplicity, practicality and familiarity compared with the log-normal and Weibull distributions. Under the surface conditions that could result in a very low ACOF, there  could be a large number of measurements with the ACOF values near zero. Likewise, there could be a large number of measure- ments with a high ACOF under dry conditions. In the estimate of slip probability, when the ACOF is compared with the RCOF, one could assume, for practical purposes, that the ACOF is a constant under certain circumstances without signiÔ¨Åcantly affecting the estimate of slip probability. Seven more cases could be represented as constants when compared with RCOF. Two cases could be rep- resented for practical purposes by a normal distribution by their skewness and kurtosis values. No representation could be found in three cases out of 15. More measurements are needed to explore the ACOF distributions of other surfaces and conditions.

s0003687013002172,"  Work-related musculoskeletal disorders (WRMSDs) refer to a broad range of inÔ¨Çammatory and degenerative conditions that affect the body‚Äôs muscles, tendons, ligaments, joints, and blood vessels (Punnett and Wegman, 2004). In the US, almost 70 million physician ofÔ¨Åce visits each year can be attributed to WRMSD- related complaints and the economic burden resulting from these complaints, including costs associated with workers‚Äô compensa- tion, and lost wages and productivity, is estimated at $45 to $54 billion annually (Research Council and Institute of Medicine, 2001). Moreover, in the US and other countries (e.g., Canada, Sweden), WRMSDs lead to more work absenteeism and disability than any other disease group (Punnett and Wegman, 2004). In 2011, WRMSDs accounted for 33% of all workplace injuries and illnesses that required employees to take days off from work (Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2012). Employees with WRMSDs took a median of 11 days to recuperate before resuming work (Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2012). WRMSDs represent a signiÔ¨Åcant threat to the health and quality of life of individuals employed in a wide range occupations (e.g., nursing, clerical work, airplane baggage handling, cleaning, truck driving, Ô¨ÅreÔ¨Åghting) and industries (e.g., service, construction, transportation, manufacturing) (Bureau of Labor  * Corresponding author.

In 2011, nursing as- sistants had the highest number of WRMSD cases (25,010) of any occupation, and heavy and tractor-trailer truck drivers needed the most days away from work (median of 21) to recuperate (Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2012). Beyond taking time off from work to recu- perate, employees may choose a more permanent solution such as changing jobs or retiring (Long et al., 2012). Studies on WRMSDs have traditionally focused on how physical job demands can lead to WRMSD complaints by generating biomechanical strain (for reviews, see Muggleton et al., 1999; National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health [NIOSH], 1997). For example, repetitive work, handling heavy materials, working in awkward positions (e.g., working above shoulder level, kneeling), and frequently using vibrating tools are physical aspects of job tasks that have been associated with greater risk of WRMSDs (e.g., Engels et al., 1996; Hansson et al., 2000; Latza et al., 2000; Simon et al., 2008; Sobeih et al., 2006; Yassi et al., 1995). Howev- er, there is increasing evidence that psychosocial stressors at work can serve as additional risk factors for WRMSDs (e.g., Hauke et al., 2011; Kraatz et al., 2013; Lang et al., 2012; Simon et al., 2008; Sobeih et al., 2006). Psychosocial factors typically refer to aspects of the psychological and social (as opposed to physical) work environment that elicit a mental stress response in workers (Marras et al., 2009; Warren, 2001). High workload, time pressure, and monotony, and low job clarity, autonomy, social support, and job security are examples of psychosocial factors associated with increased WRMSD symptoms (Bongers et al., 1993; Lang et al., 2012; NIOSH, 1997; Sobeih et al., 2006).

758  J. Golubovich et al.  / Applied Ergonomics 45 (2014) 757e766  Hauke et al. (2011) estimated that adverse psychosocial working conditions increase the risk of WRMSDs in various body regions by 15e59%. Unfortunately, the mechanisms linking psychosocial factors to WRMSD symptoms are not well understood. Even though multiple theoretical models (e.g., Bongers et al., 1993; Faucett, 2005; Melin and Lundberg, 1997; Sauter and Swanson, 1996) articulate these mechanisms, research provides inconsistent support for the path- ways these models propose (e.g., Kjellberg and Wadman, 2007; Larsman et al., 2011; Swanson and Sauter, 2006; Wadman and Kjellberg, 2007). Certain limitations in many of the studies in this area may have contributed to contradictory Ô¨Åndings. First, although the stress process as conceptualized by the transactional job stress framework (e.g., DeLongis et al., 1988; Lazarus and Folkman, 1984) is relatively well accepted by stress researchers (Mark and Smith, 2008), few studies in the area of WRMSDs directly test the hypoth- esized pathway of stressor-strain-physical symptoms that this framework implies (for an exception, see Eatough et al., 2012). Instead, effects of stressors (e.g., qualitative job demands, role con- Ô¨Çict, lack of control) are often examined in conjunction with those of strain (e.g., job dissatisfaction, negative mood, physical stress symptoms; e.g., Latza et al., 2002; Smith et al., 2004; Yip, 2002), making it difÔ¨Åcult to evaluate their relative impact on employees‚Äô WRMSD symptoms. Likewise inconsistent with the transactional job stress framework, studies typically examine only the bivariate re- lationships between psychosocial factors and musculoskeletal symptoms, as opposed to hypothesizing more complex processes. Second, many studies have used single-item measures written speciÔ¨Åcally for the study (e.g., Bigos et al., 1991; Smith et al., 2004; Swanson and Sauter, 2006) to assess psychosocial stressors or strain (see Davis and Heaney, 2000 for a review). The use of single- item measures can result in lower reliability, greater imprecision, and narrower scope than the use of established, multiple-item measures (Spector, 1992). Third, although physical job demands are a signiÔ¨Åcant risk factor in the development of WRMSDs (Muggleton et al., 1999; NIOSH, 1997), studies sometimes fail to control for physical demands when examining the effects of psy- chosocial stressors (e.g., Kjellberg and Wadman, 2007; Larsman et al., 2011). Finally, a lot of studies that examined the effects of  psychosocial factors on WRMSDs failed to consider potentially important individual difference variables (e.g., self-efÔ¨Åcacy, opti- mism, hardiness) that may inÔ¨Çuence employees‚Äô responses to psychosocial stressors (e.g., Kjellberg and Wadman, 2007; Larsman et al., 2011). Thus, some of the inconsistency in Ô¨Åndings could stem from not separating out the effects of stressors from those of strain, using measures with poor psychometric properties, failing to con- trol for physical job demands, and not taking individual differences into consideration. The current study provides a direct test of a model based on the transactional stress framework (Lazarus and Folkman, 1984), uses established measures of psychosocial stressors, strain, and WRMSD symptoms, controls for the effects of physical workload, and ex- amines the role of an important individual difference variable in the stressor-strain-WRMSD symptoms process. The study aims to contribute to researchers‚Äô understanding of the mechanisms link- ing psychosocial stressors with WRMSD complaints. As shown in Fig. 1, we propose that when employees perceive poor psycholog- ical safety climate, such perceptions may function as a psychosocial stressor and elicit frustration. Frustration, in turn, may be associ- ated with increased reporting of WRMSDs. Moreover, we explore employees‚Äô psychological hardiness, an individual difference vari- able that characterizes how employees handle stressful situations, as a moderator of the effect of poor safety climate perceptions on WRMSD complaints via frustration. In the paragraphs that follow, we provide an overview of the transactional job stress framework, explain how psychological safety could inÔ¨Çuence WRMSD complaints via frustration, and introduce psychological hardiness as a potential buffer of the ef- fects of poor safety climate. We will present our hypotheses for this study, explain the methodology that was pursued, and summarize the Ô¨Åndings. We will conclude the paper by discussing the impli- cations and limitations of current Ô¨Åndings, and providing a number of directions for future research.  1.1.  Transactional  job stress framework  The classic model of occupational stress postulates stress as the process describing how work-related factors contribute to  Fig. 1. Schematic model of stressor-strain-WRMSD complaint relationships.  
J. Golubovich et al.  / Applied Ergonomics 45 (2014) 757e766  759  decrements in psychological or physical health (Beehr, 1995). Stressors are the work-related factors that elicit the stress process, and strain represents psychological or physiological responses to stress (Hurrell et al., 1998). The transactional approach expands upon the static framework linking stressors to strains, and treats stress as a dynamic process where personal and environmental variables interact over time to cause stress (Hart and Cooper, 2001). Lazarus and colleagues‚Äô (e.g., DeLongis et al., 1988; Lazarus and Folkman, 1984) transactional stress framework proposes that in- dividuals appraise the stressors in their environment, including these stressors‚Äô potential costs, and plan which behavioral, emotional, or social strategies they will use to cope. Coping stra- tegies may be adaptive and reduce strain (Higgins and Endler, 1995), or maladaptive and actually increase strain (de Jong and Emmelkamp, 2000). The transactional approach provides a framework for linking psychosocial stressors with WRMSD complaints. Various job de- mands and organizational constraints act as occupational stressors that threaten employees‚Äô ability to achieve desired work outcomes (Boswell et al., 2004). Because stressors, such as role ambiguity, role conÔ¨Çict, and negative perceptions of the organizational context (e.g., high perceived politics or bureaucracy), require employees to expend efforts to appraise and cope with the demands, they induce strain responses such as frustration, emotional exhaustion, and depression (Boswell et al., 2004; Lazarus and Folkman, 1984). These emotional strains, in turn, result in other attitudinal (e.g., low morale), behavioral (e.g., poor performance), or physical (e.g., muscle tension, hyperventilation) outcomes (Carter and Russell, 1979; Chang et al., 2009; LePine et al., 2005; Ley, 1999). In the current study, we view poor psychological safety climate as a psychosocial stressor that may be related to WRMSD symptoms through its association with employee emotional strain (in the form of frustration). Unlike other models, which focus mainly on the role of job characteristics or environmental factors in the stress process (e.g., demands-control-support model, Karasek and Theorell, 1990; effort-reward imbalance model, Siegrist, 1996), the transactional approach to occupational stress explains why different individuals exposed to the same level of a stressor may experience different levels of emotional or physical strains (Mark and Smith, 2012). SpeciÔ¨Åcally, individuals who differ in their dispositions are likely to appraise and respond to stressors differently. Psychological hardi- ness (e.g., Eschleman et al, 2010), self-efÔ¨Åcacy (e.g., Jex and Bliese, 1999), optimism (e.g., Scheier and Carver, 1985), and conscien- tiousness (e.g., Watson and Hubbard, 1996) are examples of attri- butes that have been associated with more effective coping with stressors. Certain other attributes (e.g., neuroticism, Watson and Hubbard, 1996) have been associated with less effective coping. In the current study, we focus on psychological hardiness as a moderator of the negative effects of psychological safety climate on emotional strain and WRMSD complaints. We next elaborate on our predictions regarding psychological safety climate and frustration before proceeding to a more detailed discussion of psychological hardiness.  1.2.  Psychological safety climate as a stressor  Safety climate refers to employees‚Äô perceptions of safety pol- icies, procedures, and practices within their unit or organization (Zohar and Luria, 2005). Similar to other types of speciÔ¨Åc climates, safety climate may be considered at various levels within the or- ganization (Hellriegel and Slocum, 1974; James and Jones, 1974; Zohar and Luria, 2005). Psychological safety climate refers to indi- vidual employees‚Äô own perceptions of their work environment concerning safety-related policies and practices, and is likely to be  linked to individual-level outcomes. On the other hand, unit-level (e.g., work-team, organization) safety climate refers to the shared perceptions among employees of the same unit and is appropriate for unit-level analysis (Schulte et al, 2006). A recent meta-analysis demonstrated the importance of differentiating between psycho- logical and unit-level safety climate (Beus et al., 2010). The current paper will focus on employees‚Äô individual perceptions of their work environment concerning policies and practices related to safety, as WRMSD symptoms are reported as an individual-level outcome. Research has demonstrated the relevance of safety climate for various safety-related outcomes. Multiple meta-analyses have supported safety climate‚Äôs negative associations with accidents and injuries (Beus et al., 2010; Christian et al., 2009), and its positive association with safety performance (Christian et al., 2009; Clarke, 2006; Nahrgang et al., 2011). Safety climate perceptions may pre- dict WRMSD symptoms as well. SpeciÔ¨Åcally, studies have linked poor safety climate with arm pain, and back pain and injuries (Hofmann and Mark, 2006; Waters et al., 2007). Based on these Ô¨Åndings, we expect that psychological safety climate will be negatively related to WRMSD symptoms. As mentioned above, stressors can induce strain responses such as frustration, emotional exhaustion, and depression (Lazarus and Folkman, 1984). In particular, inadequate organizational safety policies, poor safety training, and management‚Äôs failure to model safety performance (e.g., wearing protective gear, maintaining protective equipment, adhering to safety procedures) can be stressful for employees in several ways. Such poor safety climate can generate ambiguity regarding appropriate safety behaviors, signal management‚Äôs general indifference to workers‚Äô safety and well-being, and create conÔ¨Çicting demands for employees (e.g., follow formal safety policies and procedures designed to protect employees versus focus instead on production goals; Hemingway, 1999; Siu et al., 2004; Wallace and Chen, 2006). Indeed, evidence supports poor psychological safety climate functioning as a stressor that elicits emotional strains. For example, Clarke et al. (2002) found that nurses who perceived their hospitals to provide inadequate safety training and scarce resources (e.g., low stafÔ¨Ång, lack of knowledge for using safety equipment) for pro- tecting nurses reported higher levels of emotional exhaustion and frustration. In addition, Siu et al. (2004) found that when em- ployees perceived their peers and managers to have low safety attitudes and considered safety a low priority, they experienced higher levels of anxiety and dissatisfaction. Thus, we expect poor safety climate to function as a stressor that may induce emotional strain such as frustration.  1.3.  Frustration and WRMSD complaints  According to Sauter and Swanson (1996), the physiological consequences of experiencing strain may partly explain the observed association between psychosocial stressors and WRMSD symptoms. For example, frustration may increase muscular tension (Carter and Russell, 1979), which may add to the biomechanical strain employees are under when performing physically demanding tasks and contribute to the development of WRMSDs (Krantz et al., 2004; Lundberg et al., 1994). Moreover, frustration may lead to increased physiological susceptibility to WRMSDs by affecting hormonal, circulatory, and respiratory responses. For example, frustration is often associated with hyperventilation (Ley, 1999), which disrupts the acid-based equilibrium in the blood stream and results in physiological reactions such as muscle spasms and tension (Schleifer et al, 2002). Frustration has also been found to decrease immune system response through activity inhibition (Schultheiss et al, 2009) and increase blood pressure (Landsbergis et al., 1994), which may increase employees‚Äô susceptibility to  
760  J. Golubovich et al.  / Applied Ergonomics 45 (2014) 757e766  WRMSDs (Smith and Carayon, 1996). For example, the body‚Äôs ability to repair tissue after microtrauma may be limited due to changes in individuals‚Äô physiobiological systems (Carayon et al., 1999). In addition to physiological mechanisms, other explanations exist for the linkage between frustration and WRMSDs. Frustration is associated with risky behavior (e.g., over-exertion), which in- creases the risk for WRMSDs (Smith and Carayon, 1996). In addi- tion, frustration is often associated with increased pain sensitivity and reduced efÔ¨Åcacy for managing pain (Muris et al., 2007). It has also been related to the higher reporting of pain experiences (Craig and Brown, 1984). Thus, it is possible that employees who experi- ence frustration as a result of poor safety climate may be more likely to develop and report (due to lower tolerance for discomfort and pain) WRMSD symptoms.  1.4.  Psychological hardiness as a buffer  As discussed above, the transactional approach to occupational stress underscores the role of individual differences in the process of stress appraisal and coping (Mark and Smith, 2012). Psycholog- ical hardiness is one individual difference that has been examined in the context of the stress process (Eschleman et al, 2010). Psy- chological hardiness is a personality composite of three attributes that are important for how people experience and manage stressful circumstances (Cole et al., 2004; Kobasa, 1979). SpeciÔ¨Åcally, Maddi and colleagues (Kobasa et al., 1982; Maddi et al., 2002) identiÔ¨Åed commitment, control, and challenge as characteristics that serve as buffers of the negative effects of stressors in organizational envi- ronments. Commitment refers to individuals‚Äô tendency to get deeply involved in whatever they do or encounter. Control refers to individuals‚Äô tendency to experience a sense of mastery over situa- tions they encounter. Finally, challenge describes individuals‚Äô belief that change is normal and represents opportunities for growth and development (Kobasa et al., 1982). Commitment, control, and challenge are interrelated, but non-redundant constructs (Bartone et al., 1989) and together they form the higher order construct of hardiness that characterizes individuals‚Äô positivity and resiliency when facing situational demands or threats (Maddi and Khoshaba, 1994). Hardiness inÔ¨Çuences how individuals experience and cope with stressful circumstances (Britt et al., 2001; Cole et al., 2004). Those who are high in hardiness may react more positively to stressors because they tend to interpret stressful events as opportunities, stay engaged in difÔ¨Åcult situations, and feel more in control of such situations (Cole et al., 2004; Maddi, 1999). Supporting this perspective, primary studies have indicated that hardiness in- Ô¨Çuences how people experience and interpret stressful circum- stances, insulates them from the effects of stress, and predicts future well-being (Bartone, 1999; Cole et al., 2004; Kobasa, 1979; Rosen et al., 2006). A recent meta-analysis examined these types of effects in the existing literature and argued that hardiness is ‚Äúone of the best dispositional predictors of well-being‚Äù (Eschleman et al, 2010, p. 303). In this study, hardiness may insulate employees from the negative effects of poor safety climate. For example, highly hardy employees may remain committed to working safely even when their general environment is not supportive of their efforts. They may also feel a stronger sense of control over their safety at work. Finally, they may view poor safety climate as a challenge to conquer. As such, instead of experiencing frustration due to ambi- guity and conÔ¨Çicting demands, psychologically hardy employees may actively engage in behaviors that can help improve the climate (e.g., form and get involved in safety committees to make man- agement aware of safety-related issues). Thus, given that  psychological hardiness has been shown to buffer the negative effects of stressors (Eschleman et al., 2010), we expect it to mod- erate the relationship between safety climate and frustration, and the indirect effects of safety climate on WRMSD symptoms.  1.5. Hypotheses  be  related  be  negatively  negatively  to WRMSD  Hypothesis 1 Psychological safety climate will related to WRMSD symptoms. Hypothesis 2 Psychological safety climate will related to frustration. Hypothesis 3 Frustration will be positively symptoms. Hypothesis 4 Psychological hardiness will moderate the relation- ship between safety climate and frustration, such that the negative relationship between safety climate and frustration will be weaker for highly hardy employees. Hypothesis 5 Psychological hardiness will moderate the indirect effect of safety climate on WRMSD symptoms, such that the negative effect of safety climate on WRMSD symptoms will be weaker for highly hardy employees.  2. "
s0003687013002196,"  Recent disasters such as the Columbia loss, the 9.11 terrorist attacks, the Katrina hurricane, and the Fukushima nuclear accident were high-surprise events in which organizations were caught in response situations where previous training, established tactics, or well deÔ¨Åned procedures simply do not exist. Under such situations, new failure conditions challenge existing emergency plans, safety systems, and organizations, and achieving high levels of perfor- mance in responding to these challenges in high risk and complex systems requires resilience, including the ability to act in situations of surprise (Hollnagel et al., 2006). Large-scale socio-technical organizations that use risk technol- ogies attempt to enhance their capacity to deal with disasters by practicing emergency response using simulations. Domains in which safety is paramount, like aviation, chemical, and nuclear plants use simulation because simulations of accident or abnormal situations are the only way to prepare people to deal with events/ situations that are unlikely to occur in reality. Simulation offers opportunities to design new technologies (Carvalho et al., 2008), to train operators, to test existing procedures (Carvalho and Oliveira,  * Corresponding author.

Energia Nuclear/Instituto  de  de  2009), and in the case of emergency response simulations, to pre- pare agencies and people to better respond to a real emergency. Some types of simulation can offer high Ô¨Ådelity, even in a controlled environment, to better reproduce rare and critical situations. Such simulations have been widely used to test Nuclear Power Plants‚Äô (NPPs) emergency response plans, as part of their licensing requirements. Simulation training can present opportunities for organizations to work on human factors, such as group dynamics, and to explore how the organization might respond to hitherto unelaborated conditions or surprises. It is still often the case, however, that training and simulation exercises seek principally to show and develop individual competency to deal with prescribed and well deÔ¨Åned emergency situations, not addressing human factors and response to surprises speciÔ¨Åcally (Malakis and Kontogiannis, 2008; Takahashi and Kitamura, 2013). According to Klein (2001) team coordination is the attempt by multiple entities to act in concert in order to achieve a common goal by carrying out a script/plan they all understand. Good team coordination is paramount for an adequate nuclear emergency response. Large-scale socio-technical organizations might be more resilient if they used the opportunities provided by these exercises and simulations to more effectively capture learning and to facili- tate a deeper understanding of the cognitive work and team co- ordination in the domain (Malakis and Kontogiannis, 2008; Voshell et al., 2008).  0003-6870/$ e see front matter √ì 2013 Elsevier Ltd and The Ergonomics Society.

J.O. Gomes et al.  / Applied Ergonomics 45 (2014) 780e788  781  A critical aspect of these run-throughs is practicing teamwork and coordination over multiple groups in different facilities as the simulated disaster evolves and cascades (Woods and Hollnagel, 2006). In addition, how well teams work together and the difÔ¨Å- culties they encounter in these simulated cases provide informa- tion about sources of resilience and brittle points in the emergency response system. The deployment of an Emergency Plan requires complex cognitive and collaborative skills, and a variety of Cogni- tive Task Analysis (CTA) techniques can be used to extract infor- mation about these skills from the resources available (Woods and Hollnagel, 2006; Crandall et al., 2006), and to learn more about the domain challenges, which is our focus in this research. In Brazil, we are applying CTA techniques to the nuclear incident emergency response exercises to investigate emergency manage- ment issues, such as the decision-making of the emergency response coordinator (Voshell et al., 2008). We used the CTA approach to identify sources of resilience and brittleness, analyzing how the team handled the emergency response simulation exer- cise. Identifying the sources of resilience and brittleness helps provide indicators of the emergency response system‚Äôs level of resilience and can suggest design directions such that future emergency response simulation exercises help enhance team per- formance by including group dynamics and exploration of re- sponses to surprises in the exercise plan.  measures are included under the D2 approach and it must be taken when all physical barriers fail, resulting in the liberation of radio- active materials into the environment. In a nuclear accident sce- nario, with radioactive release to the environment, emergency measures are taken and people must be evacuated from the vicinity of the plant, as occurred in the recent Fukushima nuclear accident in Japan. Therefore consistent emergency response systems must be included in the overall safety approach of the nuclear power plants, and to deliver a license for NPP operation, government and regulatory authorities would have to assess the plant emergency response systems, as well as they access the physical safety barriers. Emergency response measures and plans aim to handle the po- tential damage that a nuclear disaster may cause, and response agencies must be prepared and capable to stabilize an accident, protect life and the environment, and be prepared for command, control and coordination of a response in order to coordinate efforts toward a common goal (FEMA, 2006). One of the most important measures to respond to a nuclear major accident is the External Emergency Plan (EEP), where local governments, agencies and people concerned work together in a previously deÔ¨Åned place, outside the Nuclear Power plant, to follow the evolution and consequences of the accident, to classify and distinguish local ranges of accidents and to take measures and procedures to mitigate the consequences of a Nuclear accident for people and for the environment.  1.1.  Emergency response in nuclear power plants  1.2.  Emergency response in Brazilian NPPs  Since the Ô¨Årst atomic reactor created by Enrico Fermi in 1942, safety aspects are an important part in the development and operation of Nuclear Power Plants (NPPs) (Martin, 2002). The defense-in-depth (D2) safety approach used in NPPs aims to avoid the liberation of Ô¨Åssion products to the environment in case of a major nuclear accident (WNA, 2008). Emergency response  The nuclear emergency management regulations in Brazil are similar to the worldwide regulations and the EEP is centered on the notion of Emergency Planning Zones (EPZs), circle areas within 3, 5, 10 and 15 km of the nuclear power plant in which people might be more seriously and immediately affected by direct radiation exposure, shown in Fig. 1. The EEP has different measures according  Fig. 1. The emergency planning zones of Brazilian NPP.  
782  J.O. Gomes et al.  / Applied Ergonomics 45 (2014) 780e788  to the severity of accident and different actions according to each EPZ. In case of radiation release the EEP has urgent measures to remove the population from the EPZ-3 (in a radius of 3 km from the NPP), and from NPP-5. The EPZ 10 and 15 are considered environ- mental control zones, where urgent protection measures (such as population removal) are not planned, and in these zones there is only environmental monitoring. The Civil Defense estimates that there are 300 people in EPZ-3 ad 14,640 people in EPZ-5. Responsibility for the communication of risk and the formula- tion of emergency plans in the EPZ is left to the utility company running the nuclear complex, in conjunction with state and local police, Ô¨Åre, and civil defense authorities, and the local Civil Defense is responsible by the EEP conduction. The plans must be approved by the Brazilian Nuclear Regulatory Commission (CNEN). Another important regulation involves classes of Emergency Action Levels (EALs), that is, levels of response to an accident. These levels range from minor events involving no public danger (Unusual Event) to progressively more serious occurrences that may require immedi- ate response actions (Alert, Site Area Emergency and General Emergency). EALs are declared by plant operators and elicit re- sponses by emergency planners, who recommend response actions to people living in an EPZ. Only in case of General Emergency e actual or possible (immediate) indication of radioactive material release e the population of EPZ-3 and eventually of EPZ-5 will be removed from the zones.  2. Method  Our aim in observing the nuclear emergency response simula- tion exercise reported in this article was the identiÔ¨Åcation of sources of resilience and brittleness in its team coordination ac- tivities. Resilience can be very widely deÔ¨Åned as the capacity of the system/organization to successfully handle disturbances, including the surprising ones (Woods and Hollnagel, 2006). Our research method can be described as a case study research that uses CTA techniques in its analysis. Yin (1984) deÔ¨Ånes the case study research method as an empirical inquiry that investigates an actual phenomenon within its real-life context, when the bound- aries between phenomenon and context are not clearly evident, in which multiple sources of evidence are used. We collected data during the simulation of a nuclear power plant emergency where the External Emergency Plan was employed to test and better prepare agencies and people for a real event. The exercise we observed included both coordination and Ô¨Åeld activities. Our observation, however, was limited to the coor- dination activities component carried out within the conÔ¨Ånes of the Nuclear Emergency Coordination Center. The NPP where the simulation was conducted and where the studies took place is located in ANGRA dos REIS in Brazil, and besides the normal chal- lenges that already exist in emergency response situations, we faced new challenges related to the basic local infrastructure and to the need to organize the interplay of different agencies that nor- mally do not work together. This Nuclear Power plant is located quite close to a high-density population area, and the protection of people living in the neighborhoods and the preservation of the environment are the main goals of the External Emergency Plan.  2.1.  Research setting  The EEP was originally developed by the Department of Civil Defense over 10 years ago. This plan has been modiÔ¨Åed and revised multiple times by the agencies involved to become more complete and consistent. Today the EEP is a guideline to facilitate the inte- gration of each of the 26 agencies‚Äô individual Emergency Plans. The EEP is a synthesis of threats, vulnerabilities, scenarios and role  assignments of each agency in a real nuclear accident. The 26 agencies in attendance for the simulation are listed in Table 1 below. The asterisks (*) next to participants in Table 1 indicate mem- bers of the Nuclear Emergency Response Simulation Exercise Planning Committee, which is responsible for the activities listed in Table 2. The emergency response simulation we observed is part of a national exercise program that takes place each year and is based on scenarios developed by the Department of Civil Defense to test the response capabilities of the multiple agencies. The simulation starts when the simulation coordinator sends in the Ô¨Årst scenario, a warning of a small emergency in the nuclear power plant, to the Emergency Call Center. Following this Ô¨Årst message the EEP is employed to gather the representatives from all the agencies together. A conference room previously prepared for the simulation receives the representatives of each agency, as described in the EEP. After everyone gathers, multiple scenarios will be sent to the EEP coordinator, in pre-deÔ¨Åned intervals. The simulation observed in this work occurred in 2007 from 8:00 am until 5:00 pm with a small break for lunch. During the exercise development, situations become more complex, starting from local problems up to a nuclear material release into the environment, in the last part of the exer- cise. All through the different situations that occurred during the simulation, including unplanned events, the participants were aware of activities as realized in the Ô¨Åeld, and based their decision- making on their awareness of those contexts. Participants‚Äô actions had real consequences on the ground, leading to event cascades, requiring further decisions. The presence of real deployed resources contributed to the realism of the simulation.  2.2. Data collection  Data collected came from direct observations and electronic records in audio and video of the participants‚Äô interactions during the exercise. The exercise participants, and especially the emer- gency coordinator, were encouraged by the simulation exercise plan to talk aloud about their actions (when possible) to facilitate the understanding of the thought processes during the analysis  Table 1 Simulation participants.

This approach generated verbal reports of task performance to allow further thought process analysis (Ericsson and Simon, 1993). The simulation records include almost 4 h of video re- cordings of interactions between the participants, including problem-solving and decision-making situations. This video was transcribed and translated to English to be analyzed by the research group. To clarify and complete elements that were not clear in the recordings and in the ofÔ¨Åcial analysis report of the EEP experts on the EEP simulation were consulted over e-mail.  2.3. Data analysis  To examine the cognitive work in the case studied, a Protocol Analysis was used. The Protocol Analysis is a rigorous method for eliciting verbal reports of thought sequences as a valid source of data on thinking (Ericsson and Simon, 1993). Protocol analysis and content analysis (Krippendorff, 1980) are also referred to as a general data analysis procedure, where each statement in the protocol is coded according to a model of reasoning that reÔ¨Çects the goal of the research. This model of reasoning has coding categories that can include expressions of goals, observations, hypotheses and decisions, leading to analytic and representational formats that can reveal important aspects of cognitive process (Crandall et al., 2006; Carvalho et al., 2006).  2.4. Analysis and representation  Crandall et al. (2006) deÔ¨Åned the CTA analysis and representa- tion phase as a process of exploration and discovery to locate what is important in the data set, and a moment to organize and struc- ture those discoveries in order to communicate them well. In this study, data analysis and representation were conducted by means of a timeline analysis. In this timeline analysis, all the activities of the people in the room involved in the EEP simulation were rep- resented in a chart, to create a ‚Äúlongshot‚Äù view of all the simulation activities. To represent the various activities of the teams, cate- gories of actions were created based on separate analyst review. Common categories were then labeled to express analyst agreed upon key moments of the simulation, as well as to simplify the representation for analysis. These categories are listed in Table 3. The timeline used to represent the simulation activities is built on two axes, with time on the vertical axis and activity sub- categories aligned along the horizontal axis. Whenever necessary to allow the representation of different groups engaging separately simultaneously in activities in some given sub-activity category that column‚Äôs width is multiplied accordingly. The horizontal space allotted to any team engaged in any category of activity is constant. Since simultaneous activity was observed in some activity cate- gories but not in others, some activity category columns are wider than others. The intersection of the minute lines with the activity  Communication  Conversation in small groups Messages from plant/new information Explanation of details/ speciÔ¨Åc knowledge External communication (cell phone)  Repeating known information Question  Order/ command  Command to team members  Approving and taking decisions  Request for silence  Request for information  Physical/ technology  Technology problems  People arrival  People speaking in small groups New events, scenarios, information Technical explanation to share knowledge Communication outside the external emergency room BrieÔ¨Ångs to maintain common ground Doubts of the participants  Orders given by the coordinator or another leader Decisions concerning what to be done in each case To avoid dispersion of the group To avoid unclear information  Inadequate technology resources Replacements, lunch break, arrival of people  category columns (subteams) results in regular sized rectangles that were colored in, or not, depending on whether or not that action was observed at that time. The color used to Ô¨Åll the rect- angles representing observed actions is a function of the agency participant involved in the action. For example, between 10:30 am and 10:31 am of the simulation, activities involving Whispers, External Communication, and Request for Silence were observed, and therefore rectangles corresponding to actions in each one of those subcategories at 10:30 am were Ô¨Ålled in. Due to camera limitations, the recordings did not register the activities of many individuals that participated in the simulation exercise, and consequently the timeline does not represent these individuals‚Äô actions either. Only actions of individuals appearing in the videos were represented in the timeline. Fig. 2 shows a sample of the structure of the timeline analysis from 10:30 am to 11:00 am. The timeline used to represent the simulation activities was built on two axes, with the vertical axis representing time and the horizontal axis representing actions. The column widths of actions are not constant. What is constant is the horizontal space reserved to represent teams or participants engaged in the given action. Whenever necessary to allow the representation of different groups engaging separately simultaneously in some given action, the column width of that action was multiplied accordingly. The intersection of the minute lines with the action and (when appli- cable) team columns results in regular sized rectangles. Due to camera limitations, the recordings did not register the activities of many individuals that participated in the simulation exercise, and consequently the timeline does not represent these individuals‚Äô actions either; only actions of individuals appearing in the videos were represented in the timeline. Each participating agency with observed actions was color coded. The color coding key has been withheld to preserve participants‚Äô anonymity. Depending on whether or not a given action was observed at a some given time, the corresponding rectangle was colored in or not. The color used to Ô¨Åll the rectangles representing observed actions is a function of the agency involved in the action. For example, during the simulation, at 10:30 am actions involving Whispers (Conversations in Small Groups), External Communication, and Request for Silence  
784  J.O. Gomes et al.  / Applied Ergonomics 45 (2014) 780e788  Fig. 2. Detail view from the timeline analysis.  were observed, and therefore the rectangles corresponding to oc- currences of each one of those actions at 10:30 am were Ô¨Ålled in Fig. 2. The simulation exercise‚Äôs events were numbered sequentially. The numbers that can be seen in some of the action rectangles refer to the initiating event for that sequence of actions, e.g. event 16 is the event that triggered two of the actions used in the example mentioned above, and it followed through to an action at 10:31 am (Explaining Situation). For analysis and comprehension purposes, comments on speciÔ¨Åc important actions were added to the rect- angles that have a red marker on their top right corners. (For interpretation of the references to color in this Ô¨Ågure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.) After numbering all the simulation events and coding their related actions accordingly, analysis turned to sequences of actions triggered by each event to examine what actions occurred together, in search of action patterns. We ignored pair order because of observation limitations, which in many cases rendered the actual order indeterminate. The occurrences of each action pair were tallied and are presented in Table 4. The numbers at each inter- section of this table tell how many times the actions in the in- tersection‚Äôs row and column occurred together. The table‚Äôs lines (and consequently columns) were then reordered so as to bring forward the more frequently occurring ones. This reorganization  made it easier to identify some speciÔ¨Åc patterns of the simulation concerning team organization, information and actions Ô¨Çow. Agents‚Äô recurring actions or repeated behavior sequences, seen in different events or scenarios (actions sharing the same event number in the timeline), were considered patterns. Using the higher tally values in the event pairing tally table discussed above, the more likely candidates for recurring behavior patterns were identiÔ¨Åed, and then analysis returned to the timeline and the transcript for more precise identiÔ¨Åcation. Fig. 3 shows an example of an identiÔ¨Åed action pattern. This sequence of actions appeared a number of times, associated with different situations during the simulation. The example (event 55) describes team behavior upon receiving a new problem or item of information. In this pattern, the Ô¨Årst order of business was to seek common grounding (Klein et al., 2005) and mutual situation aware- ness (Carvalho et al., 2012) by holding simultaneous discussions in small groups, questioning and explaining the problem throughout the team. This is necessary, since a requirement of collaborative work is that agents‚Äô actions be predictable by all other members of the team, and this in turn requires common grounding. Following on the discussion stage, decisions were made and communicated. The example presented above is but one case. Several different mechanisms and action patterns were identiÔ¨Åed. Associating  
events and action patterns was an important step toward under- standing the reasoning process of the team. Patterns identiÔ¨Åed in this context are important, as they can shed light on the decision- making processes employed by the team and according to Natu- ralistic Decision-Making approach, in critical situations, most decision-making is based on pattern recognition (Klein, 1989; Carvalho et al., 2006). Another analysis was carried out concerning interactions be- tween people on the team. For that, the distribution of the mem- bers of the External Emergency plan was represented schematically by circles in the same formation as their distribution in the External Emergency room. Again, there are some restrictions concerning the capture range of the recording equipment. Arrows of various thicknesses representing the number and direction of interactions among the participants were superimposed on this representation. Fig. 4 presents this analysis where individual names are not pro- vided because they are undisclosed. However, there was an analysis based on the role each person had on the simulation and their participation in the simulation. This analysis was important to detect how the distribution of people in the room interfered in the communication among the team, to have a better view of the in- formation Ô¨Çow, to identify overloads and bottlenecks in the simu- lation and to identify the most important people involved in communication, decision-making activities in the simulation, and also to identify unsurprising or surprising patterns, function based grouping of interactions, and so forth. This is an interesting avenue of investigation but is beyond the scope of this article. It may be the subject of a forthcoming paper depending on associated clearance issues.  3. Discussion  The exercise we observed attempted to simulate a nuclear emergency response situation, including both coordination and Ô¨Åeld activities. Our observation, however, was limited to the coor- dination activities component carried out within the conÔ¨Ånes of the Nuclear Emergency Coordination Center. Our aim was the identiÔ¨Åcation of sources of resilience and brittleness in the team coordination activities during the EEP simulation exercise. The sources of resilience and brittleness identiÔ¨Åed based on the data analysis are of different natures. Some of them concern the design of the exercise itself (realism, dynamics, simulation development, validity), some concern to the challenges of the nuclear emergency response coordination activities.  3.1.  Sources of resilience  There were important efforts from the emergency team coor- dinator on brieÔ¨Ång/debrieÔ¨Ång dialogs to achieve a common ground and mutual situation awareness, as seen in Fig. 5, where the ‚ÄúCommunication‚Äù action category described in Table 1 stands out. According to Klein et al. (2005), agents have three challenges to- ward achieving interpredictability: (1) acting predictably and being directable, (2) signaling their status and intentions, and (3) inter- preting signals that indicate the status and intentions of other team members. Due to the dynamic characteristics of an emergency response, cross check interactions through constant brieÔ¨Ång and debrieÔ¨Ång are extremely important to achieve a mutual situation awareness and interpredictability. BrieÔ¨Ång and debrieÔ¨Ång in- teractions appeared in the timeline analysis as a behavior pattern when new messages arrive from the plant, as exempliÔ¨Åed in Figs. 3 and 4. The ability of people in an emergency response control room to revise plans, cross check data, and review previous assessments when evidence arrives and situations change leads to a more consistent and reliable decision-making process and requires  T  a  b  l  e  4  N  u  m  b  e  r  o  f  c  r  o  s s  e  d  i  n  t  e  r  a  c  t  i  o  n  s  .

The diversity of the emergency response team might be a source of resilience. The presence of representatives from 26 different agencies creates diversity in the group and broadens the knowl- edge base. Due to the variety of response measure possibilities, it is very useful to have people with different backgrounds to achieve a satisfactory solution. As already shown by Hong and Page (2004), if you get a team of people that all have some level of problem- solving skills, not necessarily all being experts in speciÔ¨Åc issues, but not novices either, the team will outperform a group of best individuals (experts in one subject). According to Klein (2001) organization is the attempt by mul- tiple entities to act in concert in order to achieve a common goal by carrying out a plan they all understand. We observed some good organization patterns in the emergency response team. In the EEP studied, emergency response team members brought their agencies‚Äô plans and scripts for emergency response. For complex  system demands, having smaller and modular plans rather than complete complex plans makes more sense, because it makes adaptation of the plan to the situation easier (Klein, 2001). We also observed reorganization patterns that emerged from the emergency response team activities. When incidents appeared requiring different competences, the agents necessary to under- stand and make decisions on speciÔ¨Åc domains gather in small groups to discuss the subject. Fig. 6 highlights the dialog concentration in the ‚ÄúConversation in small groups‚Äù and ‚ÄúExplanation of details/ speciÔ¨Åc knowledge‚Äù subcategories listed in Table 1. An example of this happened when there was an unexpected real situation arose on the road, and required a real emergency response. Anti-nuclear activists, afÔ¨Åliated to a well-known global envi- ronmental NGO, blocked roads close to the NPP area. To deal with the situation, Road, Civil and Military Police representatives gath- ered to discuss its status and dynamics and decide a course of ac- tion. Each of them then contacted their own agencies to act in concert, and shortly thereafter the demonstration was contained and the exercise resumed. These reorganization mechanisms are sources of emerging marginal value to operations, according to Klein (2001).  3.2.  Sources of brittleness  Lack of resilience or brittleness is a situation where a system is operating riskier than expected. Identifying sources of brittleness can help anticipate how the system can fail and helps preventing it (Gomes et al., 2008).  Fig. 4.  Interaction between agents analysis.  Fig. 5.

J.O. Gomes et al.  / Applied Ergonomics 45 (2014) 780e788  787  requests for silence from the team. Having a large number of in- dividuals might degrade teamwork, especially if some agents do not have an active participation in the team‚Äôs decisions and actions. A team can become too large to produce optimal results: additional members only improve team performance as long as team size does not lead to participant disengagement and their contribution ex- ceeds the team‚Äôs associated coordination cost increases (Klein, 2001). Agencies bring along their own emergency plans, generating a less complex modular overall emergency plan. A structured inte- gration and coordination plan to identify the function and role of each agency in the nuclear emergency response is required. An analysis of the existing EEP considering the integration of the agencies‚Äô plans might help to improve the simulation and increase the system‚Äôs resilience. Visual support facilitates understanding context and decision- making when time to respond is short (Schoenwald et al., 2005) as often occurs in emergency situations. In these situations, people can get lost in the details, especially if there is a lack of cognitive support, such as visual wall display panels, tactile tables, or com- puter resources in general. This cognitive support can provide better context evolution understanding and sharing among all the agents involved in the EEP, maintaining participant situational awareness, avoiding the present situation in which this is done verbally.  4.  Conclusions  In the current study we have used CTA techniques to look for possible sources of resilience and brittleness in a nuclear emer- gency response situation by analyzing a simulation exercise. Our analysis found sources of resilience and brittleness related to team coordination, simulation dynamics, and crisis response activities producing a deeper understanding of cognition at work in the nuclear emergency domain. Knowing and understanding these sources of resilience and brittleness in a system is useful to better understand how and why activities are successful or unsuccessful, and factors that may compromise system performance. The results obtained through this analysis additionally suggest that areas such as workspace redesign, visual and communication technology support are areas with high potential for improvements in emer- gency response and its simulation. To examine the sources of resilience and brittleness in emer- gency response situations, further studies and research are plan- ned. We believe this further research will support the enhancement of resilience and mitigation of brittleness, or even the trans- formation of sources of brittleness into sources of resilience, in other emergency response situations and simulations. There are challenges on how to stage such exercises and develop CTA methods so that researchers will be able to learn and abstract from these Ô¨Åeld observations. Relevant constraints on this research were the sensitivity of the domain and shortcomings inherent in the material resources available to perform the analysis. The audio and video recordings covered only a small area of the coordination center situation room. Because of this, analysis was restricted to the agents involved in the most important actions in each event. Also, although the recordings covered most of the simulation activities, it did cover them in their entirety. It is important to note that many of our recommendations for improvement are not related to the emergency response activities, but, rather, are hints of issues to improve the simulation exercise. We hope that our approach examining many exercise challenges from multiple perspectives in this research help future simulation designers and researchers to effectively capture and explore  Fig. 6. Detailed subcategories of simulations dialogs.  In our opinion, the main source of brittleness observed in the simulation was resulted from the design of the exercise, which was quite static, while a nuclear accident is highly complex and dy- namic. The emergency response team received a relatively small number of predetermined situations in a predetermined sequence, creating a less complex and challenging environment. Team behavior changed markedly when a group of activists started blocking roads in a surprise real-world situation. Agency partici- pants became noticeably more serious and marginal activities (those between people not directly involved in dealing with the situation) dropped. A ‚Äúlearning laboratory‚Äù approach might miti- gate this issue, enabling the abstraction of valuable lessons from and better design of these large-scale exercises, as proposed by Burke et al. 2007. We observed frequent brieÔ¨Ångs during the simulation. Although agents arrive at various times, depending on their agencies‚Äô response times, we did not identify the adoption of any speciÔ¨Åc brieÔ¨Ång mechanisms or support tools to bring latecomers up to speed on the current situation, issues, and decisions under way. This staggered arrival is more frequent during the Ô¨Årst hours of the simulation, when agencies contacted are sending their represen- tatives, and during lunchtime, but can be sometimes be seen during the course of the simulation, when an agent needs to be replaced for any reason. The physical distribution of individuals in the room is extremely important, as proximity and relative positions can affect in- teractions among team members. In shared workspaces, in- dividuals will organize their own activities and placement in relation to the distribution of others in the room (Engestr√∂m and Middleton, 1996). In situations such as nuclear emergency re- sponses, a large team dealing with variable complex problems will have multiple interaction conÔ¨Ågurations, and there are situations where some combinations of agencies may work better than others. An appropriate workspace organization could also enhance the organization mechanism that already exists in the emergency response team. Activities of the team coordinator are extremely important to EEP command and control. Indeed, we noted that most activities in the EEP involve team coordinator participation. This situation may result in team coordinator cognitive overload, and constrain the decision-making process (Klein, 2001). Figs. 3e5 show that most of the communication between agents happens through the team coordinator (in red).

Planning of emergency exercises needs to be resilient because when one scales up, given the use of distributed groups, spatially separated agents, and multi-hour and multi-day work environments, as required in a complete nuclear emergency simulation, unanticipated disruptions and changes will make sure events do not go as planned, as has already occurred in the exercise we observed. We conclude by observing that most studies of emergency response simulation in nuclear power plants have been undertaken in developed countries, in which the cultural issues that enable people to follow rules and instructions may be quite different than we have in developing countries. Further studies about nuclear power plant emergency response issues in developing countries are important because such countries are socially, culturally and economically different from developed countries and these differ- ences imply different demands on agents, organizations and the organization among them in the emergency response context.

s0003687013002214,"  1.1.  Chording text entry on mobile phones  Traditional cellphones mainly depend on MultiTap for text en- try, the advantage of which is that it needs far fewer keys than a conventional keyboard. Yet, its input requires multiple or repeated presses, so the key strokes per character (KSPC) are increased (MacKenzie, 2002). Not only is input efÔ¨Åciency reduced, but it is also more likely to cause repetitive strain injuries (RSI) to a hand (Balakrishnan and Yeow, 2008). Consequently, the QWERTY layout is the mainstream mode of text entry widely adopted by newly- emerging smartphones. Whether installed physically or virtually on a cellphone, the standard QWERTY keyboard, which is normally 28 cm in width, is miniaturized on a 6-cm panel. Needless to say, the key size is not in line with most human Ô¨Ångers (Wigdor, 2004). To address this problem, many researchers have developed a large number of chording input devices, but the fact that their learning efÔ¨Åciency are too low has led to severe criticism (Kristensson, 2007; Tinwala and MacKenzie, 2009). With respect to the above, this study endeavored to develop new modes of chording text entry, which combine physical with virtual keys simultaneously pressed, as well as comply with principles of ergonomic operation and cognitive factors. In this way, the proposed text entry methods reduce the problems with input efÔ¨Åciency and operational errors caused by overly crowded and small keys on common cellphones and chording devices.  * Corresponding author. E-mail addresses: fonggong@mail.ncku.edu.tw, wu.oryang@hinet.net (F.-G. Wu).  To enter a character or command with a chording keyboard, users must press multiple keys simultaneously. For instance, the Half-QWERTY keyboard (Matias et al., 1993) relies on the space key as its control unit. Though it has only the left side keyboard, the left key is combined with the space key to produce a corresponding character on the right side through mirroring. Thus, the chording keyboard possesses the following features: fewer keys, a smaller size, high portability, operable in a mobile or unstable environ- ments, and prevention of injury caused by repetitive force-applying (Billinghurst et al., 2009). Accordingly, it is suitable for mobile devices. Twiddler was invented as a one-handed chording device (Lyons et al., 2006). With its keys arranged in alphabetic order, Twiddler enters a letter through the chording text entry of multiple keys. In addition, it can deÔ¨Åne a wide range of input characters, so there are many combinations that can be deÔ¨Åned for the input of multiple characters, such as -ing and -tion (Wigdor, 2004). Although Twid- dler can enhance the input efÔ¨Åciency of characters, some studies have shown that its Ô¨Çoor entry rate is too low, its learning time too long, and its error rate too high (Kristensson, 2007; Tinwala and MacKenzie, 2009). Furthermore, with too many keys present, its key layout will have various inÔ¨Çuences on users of different gender, palm size, and Ô¨Ånger length (Lyons et al., 2004). As a result, it is somewhat difÔ¨Åcult to convert the hand-held Twiddler into a device fully compatible with mobile phones. Wigdor and Balakrishnan developed two new modes of chord- ing text entry for cellphones, i.e., TiltText and ChordTap (Wigdor  0003-6870/$ e see front matter √ì 2013 Elsevier Ltd and The Ergonomics Society. All rights reserved. http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2013.10.011  
826  F.-G. Wu et al.  / Applied Ergonomics 45 (2014) 825e832  and Balakrishnan, 2003). TiltText combines the MultiTap layout and four directional movements, namely, forward, backward, left, and right movements, to select a particular character. A similar concept is also found in ChordTap (Wigdor, 2004). ChordTap adds three chording keys to the back of the traditional 12-key Ô¨Çip phone, and the three keys are used to control the selection of characters on the front keyboard. This means that users must press the numeric key with one hand, and press one of the chord keys with the other. The above two methods divide the letters into individual groups; then, in the process of typing, a certain group is Ô¨Årst selected through one key, and then a member of the group is selected through the cor- responding key or the tilt angle. Thus, the problem connected with the high KSPC is effectively relieved. However, it is rather difÔ¨Åcult for users to execute such a two-stage selection simultaneously, so input efÔ¨Åciency is still not improved.  1.2.  Ergonomic rules and design elements  Text entry is a fairly complex process, involving visual, tactile, motion, memory, learning, and other cognitive functions. More- over, they belong to different levels of cognitive processing. The process of text entry is subject to the biomechanical constraints of the hand. Whether perceptual and cognitive concepts are suitable will dominantly affect the user‚Äôs Ô¨Ånal performance, such as the response time and accuracy rate of typing (Logan, 2003). Therefore, if a new input method is to be designed, ergonomic operation and cognitive compatibility must be emphasized. According to Fitts‚Äô law concerning motion execution (Fitts, 1954), the keyboard layout should be arranged so that a Ô¨Ånger travels the minimum distance necessary, allowing text entry efÔ¨Å- ciency to be improved. Moreover, some studies have shown that if two hands are used simultaneously to do a non-computing job, operational efÔ¨Åciency will be enhanced because of two-handed coordination (Sandnes and Aubert, 2007). Further, users‚Äô familiar- ity with the QWERTY keyboard, procedural memory, which here concerns Ô¨Ångers corresponding to different letters, should be incorporated into ergonomic considerations when typing actions are designed. Consequently, users need not invest too much cognitive effort while typing (McLoone et al., 2003). Realizing that the procedural memory has a subtle effect on users, many re- searchers have employed the transfer effect of learning to conduct relevant designs or studies (Hwang and Lee, 2005; MacKenzie and Soukoreff, 2002; Matias et al., 1993; McLoone et al., 2003; Sandnes and Aubert, 2007). Contrarily, if the layout design is different from the user‚Äôs original procedural memory, it will cause interference (McLoone et al., 2003). In addition to enhancing motional perfor- mance, researchers have also changed the user interface, singled out the character keys on the touchscreen dynamically, enlarged the area of the selected characters, and shortened the distance between characters in order to enhance input performance and reduce error rates (Merlin and Raynal, 2010). Apart from an ergonomic layout matching users‚Äô actions, cognitive concepts must be consistent with users‚Äô intuition, past experience and memory. Roughly categorized, the methods for text entry are based on two kinds of arrangement: alphabetic order and QWERTY layout. However, which of the two layouts is most suit- able for users? Sandnes and Aubert (2007) argued that the QWERTY layout is much easier for users to become familiar with, and therefore is more suitable for the arrangement of letters. Hence, they took the advantage of users‚Äô spatial familiarity with the QWERTY layout, and designed a joystick that enabled users to perform text entry. Hwang and Lee (2005) also presented their assertion that the alphabetic order makes it more difÔ¨Åcult for user to memorize and results in low typing efÔ¨Åciency. Accordingly, they developed the 3  4 mobile keyboard, the layout of which is similar  to QWERTY, resulting in better performance than the standard keyboard with an alphabetic layout. The cognitive compatibility of encoding is also a very important factor. For instance, Matias et al. (1993) developed the Half- QWERTY chording keyboard, which is operated only with the left hand. The corresponding characters originally typed with the right hand are in the form of mirrored entities. Nevertheless, they did not account for why the keyboard design was based on the mirror approach instead of spatial congruence. Munhall and Ostry (1983) reported that the motional control of the left and right hands is through mirroring rather than direct spatial congruence (cite from Billinghurst et al., 2009). Further, according to the Ô¨Åndings regarding the stimulus-response compatibility effect (SRC effect), different hand postures will affect encoding patterns, which will vary with the relationship between visual stimulus and Ô¨Ånger re- action (Ehrenstein et al., 1989).  2. Observation: users‚Äô typing postures on different phones  Understanding the typing postures of how users operate their mobile phones is crucial for developing new ways of interaction for text entry chording methods. Based on the observation by Gold et al. (2012), three postures were found to occur most often by mobile phone users: holding the phone in one hand while using the index Ô¨Ånger of another hand, holding the phone in the palm of the hand while using the thumb of the same hand, and using both hands to hold the phone and typing with both thumbs (Fig. 1). Furthermore, this study tried to analyze the relationship between the typing postures and phones with different typing methods. Therefore, in this stage, the main purpose was to observe the postures when using phones with different typing methods. Forty-six participants (24 men and 22 women), aged between 18 and 39 (M ¬º 25.48, SD ¬º 4.88) were recruited from National Cheng Kung University (NCKU). They were asked to perform text entry on their own mobile phone. The results show that mobile phones could be roughly characterized into two types: physical and virtual (touchscreen) keyboards, and the layout of those two key- boards can also be divided into MultiTap and QWERTY. The par- ticipants also demonstrated three operating postures that resembled to the result of Gold et al. As Table 1 shown, mobile phones with a physical keyboard and MultiTap style were owned by most participants, and they tended to hold the phone with their right hand and type with their right thumb. Phones with virtual keyboards most frequently featured the QWERTY layout, where participants tended to use the left hand to hold the phone and operate it with their right index Ô¨Ånger. However, to determine which of the above three operating postures is suitable for the new chording methods can be compared via the two perspectives. First, the operating posture needs to avoid the occlusion problem (fat Ô¨Ånger problem) (Wigdor et al., 2007) where the user‚Äôs Ô¨Ånger is too big and induces the error of touching neighboring keys. Consequently, some researchers have compared different Ô¨Ånger precision of target selection and found that the performance of the index Ô¨Ånger was relatively better than the thumb (Sheik-Nainar, 2010; Wang and Ren, 2009). Secondly, the movement time of different operating postures can also be considered as the reason for new design. Silfverberg et al. (2000) compared right hand holding, right thumb typing and left hand holding, right index typing on a MultiTap mobile phone, and used Fitts‚Äô law to predict the movement times of two operating postures. They found the input by left hand holding, right index typing achieved a shorter movement time and lowered the index of dif- Ô¨Åculty. Furthermore, if users held the device with their left hand and typed with their right index Ô¨Ånger, the new design could be operated by both hands. This method was found to also reduce the

There- fore, holding the phone in one hand and using the index Ô¨Ånger of the other was chosen as the basic posture to develop the new chording text entry methods in this study.  3. The design concept of the new chording text entry methods  Based on the results of above-mentioned studies, this study was consistent with Fitts‚Äô law of movement and accuracy. The place where one‚Äôs hand holds the cellphone was taken as a reference point, and some physical keys were installed on its side. Also, the QWERTY layout was adopted as the foundation of the chording text entry. Naturally, compatibility between the keys and keyboard encoding must be taken into consideration. After observing and comparing how users performed text entry on their cellphones, the design was based on holding with the left hand, and the character selected with the right index Ô¨Ånger. Therefore, the authors made text entry possible by combining the physical keys on the side of the cellphone and the virtual keys on the screen. Furthermore, in accordance with Wigdor et al., chording text entry was mainly composed of area-selecting and character-selecting (Wigdor and Balakrishnan, 2003; Wigdor, 2004). Thus, the authors‚Äô design of the keys involved two modes of text entry, as described in the following paragraphs. In the Ô¨Årst mode, the physical keys are used to select an area, and an interface is then used to input exact characters. In the second mode, the virtual keys are used for area- selecting, and the physical keys are then used to input exact characters.  3.1. MagArea text entry  Under the MagArea text entry method, three keys on the side of a cellphone are used for area-selecting, and the touch interface is used to select exact characters. The three keys on the side respec- tively represent the upper, middle, and lower rows of the standard QWERTY keyboard. After an area (row) is selected, ten intersected hint boxes appear on the interface, where the characters originally operated with the left or right hand are marked with different colors and placed into different sections. For instance, if character D is the target character, users select the middle row with their left middle Ô¨Ånger. Meanwhile, hint boxes with nine characters will appear on the screen, and character D could be selected with their right index Ô¨Ånger. As the method is based on chording text entry, users can select an area and exact character simultaneously after they are familiar with the location of each character, as elaborated in Fig. 2.  3.2. MemoryTap text entry  Under the MemoryTap text entry method, Ô¨Åve keys on the phone‚Äôs side are used to select exact characters, and the touch interface is used to select an area. To be more speciÔ¨Åc, the right index Ô¨Ånger clicks the touch interface to select one of the six box areas, and the left hand presses one of the Ô¨Åve keys for character- selecting. Furthermore, the mirror principle of the Half-QWERTY keyboard (Matias et al., 1993) as well as the encoding rules based on Orthogonal Stimulus-response Compatibility are followed. As a result, as with standard keyboard encoding, the spatial encoding for the left-handed keys of MemoryTap turns the left-to-right characters into the bottom-to-top ones, i.e., left-bottom/right-top. Contrarily, the spatial encoding for the right-handed keys turns the left-to-right characters into the top-to-bottom ones, i.e., left- top/right-bottom (Ehrenstein et al., 1989). Thus, characters origi- nally input with a right Ô¨Ånger are operated with its corresponding Ô¨Ånger on the left hand. For example, if character D is the target character, the area on the interface where character D exists is selected with the right index Ô¨Ånger. Meanwhile, characters G, F, D, S, and A are organized from top to bottom (left-bottom/right-top) on the physical buttons. Thus, with the middle Ô¨Ånger pressing the key, character D is entered successfully. Moreover, the keys on the right side are arranged as a result of mirrored typing. For instance, if character K is the target character, the area on the interface where K exists is selected with the right index Ô¨Ånger. Then, characters H, J, K, and L are organized from top to bottom (left-top/right-bottom) on the physical buttons. Thus, with the middle Ô¨Ånger pressing the correct key, character K is entered successfully. Similarly, after becoming familiar with the layout, a user can perform synchronous text entry, as illustrated in Fig. 3.  4.  Evaluation  Evaluation experiments in this study were primarily intended to understand the learning efÔ¨Åciency, input performance, and error rates of the new text entry methods. Sandnes and Aubert (2007) argued that, for a successful device, ease of learning is a rather crucial factor. In the past, all chording text entry methods required long-term practice and testing, a reality that was severely criticized. Consequently, the new methods have emphasized ease of learning, low learning threshold, and good input performance to be achieved in a short time. Unlike a previous longitudinal study (Lyons et al., 2006), this study required the two new methods to be learned and tested within three days, with their results compared repeat- edly. In most previous studies, the learning performance of Multi- Tap has been taken as the control group. However, a virtual

Moreover, it was discovered by other researchers that the learning efÔ¨Åciency of the iPhone virtual keyboard was limited (MacKenzie et al., 2009). For this reason, the experiment participants did not need to spend any time in learning the virtual keyboard. By contrast, they spent three days in learning this study‚Äôs two new methods. Then, their learning performances of the Ô¨Ånal tests were compared with the single test result of the iPhone virtual keyboard.  4.1.  Participants  The new input methods presented in this study are based on the standard QWERTY keyboard, so participants were limited to right- handers who are familiar with a QWERTY keyboard. According to Ostrach‚Äôs investigation (1997), average typing speed is 40 words per minute (WPM); therefore, the average typing speed of 40 WPM was taken by this study as a standard to judge whether or not the potential participant was familiar with the QWERTY keyboard. To avoid interference of different dominant hands, participants Ô¨Ålled out the Edinburgh Handedness Inventory (OldÔ¨Åeld, 1971) so as to be established them as a right-handed person. Fourteen partici- pants (seven men and seven women) aged between 20 and 28 were recruited from NCKU, with their average age being 22.6. Their range of typing speed on the standard QWERTY keyboard was 41e 74 WPM, with an average of 48.86 WPM.  4.2.  Equipment and software  The experimental hardware of the two new entry methods included an Apple iPhone 4, on the side of which were self- developed Bluetooth wireless keys. The two kinds of hardware were changed in the same way as a protective cover, as shown in Fig. 4. The cellphone for the MagArea text entry had three physical keys installed on its right side while the cellphone for the Memo- ryTap text entry had Ô¨Åve physical keys. According to the Ô¨Åndings with respect to Ô¨Ånger positioning (Wu et al., 2011), the keys were properly arranged, with the top right corner of the cellphone regarded as the reference point. In the case of three physical keys, the keys operated with the index, middle, and ring Ô¨Ånger were 3.24 cm, 5.61 cm, and 7.67 cm away from the reference point, respectively. As for the Ô¨Åve keys, the keys operated with the index Ô¨Ånger were 2.74 cm or 3.74 cm away from the reference point, while the keys operated with the middle, ring, and little Ô¨Ånger were 5.61 cm, 7.67 cm, and 9.49 cm away from the reference point, respectively. It was conÔ¨Årmed by Wu‚Äôs Ô¨Åndings that the Ô¨Ånger positioning mentioned above was not inÔ¨Çuenced by gender or palm size as far as most users were concerned. The program interface was written by Apple iOS, which is an application development platform, with the help of the program language Xcode 4.0.1. The Ô¨Ånished program was capable of timing, measuring typing speed (WPM), measuring error rates, and storing many articles that could be randomly selected. As shown in Fig. 5, the input interface for the two text entry methods was mainly divided into the timing zone on the top, instant display zone,

As for article-inputting, when the input text was correct, the character in the instant display zone would turn green, and the user could go on to enter the next character. On the other hand, if the input text was wrong, the character in the instant display zone would turn red. In such a case, the user had to correct the wrong character before being allowed to move on to another. In the case of the MagArea text entry, the interface was composed of ten inter- sected pentagons, each of which measured about 58*58 pixels (about 10 mm). The letters on the left keyboard were marked in yellow while those on the right were marked in green. As for the MemoryTap text entry, the keys were divided into six groups, and the size of each group varied with the number of letters. The group with Ô¨Åve letters measured 170*50 pixels (about 26*5 mm), the group with four letters measured 130*50 pixels (about 20*5 mm), and the group with two letters measured 65*50 pixels (about 10*5 mm). When a user clicked on a certain group, it provided vi- sual feedback by turning from blue to yellow.  4.3.  Experimental design  A two factors within-participant design was applied as the experimental design. The two independent variables were the two text entry methods and three training days. Meanwhile, dependent variables were the text entry rate and error rate. The text entry rate (WPM) deÔ¨Åned a word as having Ô¨Åve characters, whether the character referred to a letter or punctuation, or even empty blank  (O‚ÄôBrien, 2006). Calculation of the error rate was done by extracting the incorrect characters entered in the experiment and presenting them in the form of a percentage of total characters. Suhm et al. (1999) indicated that the four basic factors responsible for errors were substitution, omission, insertion, and transposition. Never- theless, this study did not focus on the forming mode of errors. Reasonably enough, each participant was asked to correct any error before he/she could continue a trial. The error rate was measured by dividing the incorrect strokes with the total strokes, yielding a percentage.  4.4.  Procedure  The experiment was a within-subjects design; therefore, all participants had to learn both new text entry methods and then take tests. The entire experiment lasted 3 days, with participants learning both methods as well as completing tests each day. More speciÔ¨Åcally, participants learned each of the two methods six times and also received six tests each day. Learning and testing took place alternately, with each trial lasting for 2 min; moreover, there was a two-minute break between two trials. In other words, participants spent about one and a half hours performing the experiment. Additionally, six paragraphs from the famous literary work ‚ÄúWal- den‚Äù were chosen as the typing material (Liang et al., 2009). Both learning sequences of the text entry methods and typing materials were conducted based on the principle of counterbalance. There- fore, half of the participants were told to learn in one sequence (AB,

(For inter-  BA, AB) while the others were told to learn in another sequence (BA, AB, BA) during the three days of the learning process. All partici- pants were told to type the passage shown on the mobile screen as soon and as accurately as possible. Only the Ô¨Ånal testing trial on each day was recorded as the dependent variables of input per- formance. As for learning curves, all of the testing trials were recorded as the basis of it. Further, the two new methods were compared with the iPhone virtual keyboard after three days of learning to see which one performed best. After all participants were familiarized with the interface and operation of the iPhone virtual keyboard, they took a single test, with their performances recorded. Subsequently, the input performance of the iPhone vir- tual keyboard was compared with those of the two new methods during the last testing trial.  5. Results  In this experiment, every participant underwent three days of learning and testing for the two text entry methods. In addition, the virtual QWERTY keyboard of the iPhone was tested and used as the control group. Thus, this experiment was a within-subjects design, and input performances and error rates were all analyzed through repeated measures ANOVA.  5.1.  Text entry rate and learning curves  Through repeated measures ANOVA, it was discovered that the text entry rate improved with the increase of days (F2, 26 ¬º 177.90, p < 0.001), and that the MemoryTap text entry performed better than the MagArea text entry (F1, 13 ¬º 14.49, p < 0.01). There was an interaction effect between the number of days and the two judging from text entry rates (F2, 26 ¬º 8.98, p < 0.001). methods, With the least signiÔ¨Åcance difference (LSD) applied to make a comparison, it was revealed that there was no signiÔ¨Åcant difference between the two entry methods on the Ô¨Årst day (F1, 13 ¬º 0.89, p > 0.05). However, the MemoryTap text entry performed signiÔ¨Å- cantly better than the MagArea text entry on the second (F1, 13 ¬º 23.05, p < 0.001) and third days (F1, 13 ¬º 21.28, p < 0.001). These results indicate that the overall entry rate improved with the increased days and reached the signiÔ¨Åcance level. Also, the inter- action was caused by the higher learning efÔ¨Åciency of MemoryTap. After participants had practiced the two new methods for three days and received the Ô¨Ånal tests, their input performances were compared with those of the iPhone virtual keyboard. Results show that the MemoryTap text entry had the best performance  ¬º  (mean 18.78 WPM), followed by the virtual keyboard (mean ¬º 18.33 WPM), while the MagArea text entry had the worst performance (mean ¬º 15.08 WPM). Analyzed through repeated measures ANOVA, results indicate that there were signiÔ¨Åcant dif- ferences between the three methods (F2, 26 ¬º 10.39, p < 0.001). With LSD applied, it was discovered that the MemoryTap text entry performed signiÔ¨Åcantly better than the MagArea text entry (F1, 13 ¬º 21.28, p < 0.001). Meanwhile, the virtual keyboard performed than the MagArea text entry (F1, 13 ¬º 13.77, signiÔ¨Åcantly better p < 0.01). However, there was no signiÔ¨Åcant difference between the 13 ¬º 0.22, MemoryTap text entry and the virtual keyboard (F1, p > 0.05). After understanding the differences in learning efÔ¨Åciency of the two entry methods, the authors spread three days of learning re- sults (18 trials and 72 min in total) expand. Further, through the exponential regression function, their learning curve formulas could be obtained. Because there was no learning assignment for the iPhone virtual keyboard, its measured result was a horizontal baseline. As shown in Fig. 6, the learning curve formulas of two new entry methods were obtained, with the formula constants repre- senting their starting points. From Fig. 6, it can be seen that the MagArea text entry initially had better performance. The exponent in each formula represents the learning efÔ¨Åciency of the text entry method.

The Ô¨Ågure shows that, on the Ô¨Årst day, there was no obvious difference in learning perfor- mance. Then, on subsequent days, the growth rate of the Memo- ryTap text entry signiÔ¨Åcantly increased. Ultimately, after three days of learning, the entry efÔ¨Åciency of the MemoryTap text entry exceeded that of the virtual keyboard.  5.2.  Error rate  ¬º  (F2,  During the three days of learning, the error rates of the two entry methods were analyzed through repeated measures ANOVA. It was discovered that their error rates did not reduce with the increase of days (F2, 26 ¬º 1.20, p > 0.05). After being compared, the MagArea text entry had a signiÔ¨Åcantly lower error rate than the MemoryTap text entry (F1, 13 ¬º 15.57, p < 0.01). The interaction between the number of days and the two methods did not reach a signiÔ¨Åcant level (F2, 26 ¬º 2.57, p > 0.05). Thus, during the three days, a stable error rate was found in the two methods. After three days of learning, the last test results of the two methods were compared with that of the iPhone virtual keyboard. As indicated by the sta- tistics, the MagArea text entry had the lowest error rate (mean 3.91%), followed by the MemoryTap text entry (mean ¬º 5.64%), while the virtual keyboard performed the worst (mean ¬º 6.84%). It was discovered through repeated-measures ANOVA that there was a signiÔ¨Åcant difference between the three 26 ¬º 6.23, p < 0.01). With the LSD post-hoc methods test applied, it was revealed that the MagArea text entry performed signiÔ¨Åcantly better than the MemoryTap text entry (F1, 13 ¬º 7.37, p < 0.05) and the virtual keyboard (F1, 13 ¬º 9.21, p < 0.05). However, there was no signiÔ¨Åcant difference between the MemoryTap text entry and the virtual keyboard (F1, 13 ¬º 1.95, p > 0.05). Similarly, the participants‚Äô learning performances during the three days are represented in greater detail, and reveal how the error rates changed over time. Then, in terms of error rate, the two new methods were compared with the iPhone virtual keyboard. As shown in the above mentioned statistics, which were analyzed through repeated measures ANOVA, the error rates did not reduce with the increase of days, so no learning curve formula was calculated. In the detailed Ô¨Ågure of the learning performances below (Fig. 7), there was a trend similar to that suggested by the above statistics. To be more speciÔ¨Åc, the MagArea text entry had the lowest error rate, and its performance remained rather stable throughout the three days of practice. By contrast, the MemoryTap text entry had a rather high error rate in the Ô¨Årst few tests. How- ever, after participants were familiarized with the designated as- signments, the MemoryTap text entry performed as well as, and even better than, the virtual keyboard.  6. Discussion  After learning for three days, the two new methods were compared to identify the differences in input efÔ¨Åciency, learning efÔ¨Åciency, and error rates. Under the MagArea text entry, three physical keys were used to select an area, and the graphic user interface was used to select characters. As the physical keys divided the characters into three groups, the area covered by the touchscreen keys was expanded, and thus the error rate of input characters was effectively reduced. Despite this, the distance be- tween the virtual keys failed to be shortened, which slowed input speed. In addition, many participants claimed that the characters, which originally existed in the same row and were entered with two hands, were arranged separately in the upper and lower rows. As a result, operational procedures often occurred in the following  MagArea  MemoryTap  Virtual Keyboard  )  %  (  e  t  a  R  r  o  r r  E  16.0%  14.0%  12.0%  10.0%  8.0%  6.0%  4.0%  2.0%  0.0%  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18  Trial  Fig. 7.

Under such a situation, it was very difÔ¨Åcult for the participant to input simultaneously with both hands, leading to a lower input rate. But, in terms of error rate, the MagArea method performed better than the existing virtual keyboard; moreover, its input per- formance can be enhanced in the future by redesigning the physical keys or graphic user interface. By contrast, the MemoryTap text entry method, in which a graphic user interface was employed to select an area and the physical key was used to select a character, performed better in terms of typing speed. Also, as indicated by the learning curve, the MemoryTap method displayed higher learning efÔ¨Åciency. This is attributed to the encoding of the Ô¨Ångers according with the rules of spatial transpositional correspondence, and the resultant typing habit was very similar to that associated with the standard QWERTY keyboard. As a result, when taking performance tests, all participants did better. However, in the initial process of learning, some participants claimed that they found the MemoryTap more difÔ¨Åcult to understand than the MagArea. Yet, after getting used to the way that right-handed characters were mirrored with the left hand, the participants subjectively thought that they had achieved good performance. Meanwhile, they were highly conÔ¨Ådent with, as well as strongly interested in, the MemoryTap method. Several of the participants even mentioned that implementing a new entry method was just like playing games. Such an attitude helped to strengthen motivation and to enhance input performance, which was reÔ¨Çected in their learning performances and subjective reports. Furthermore, previous research about chording entry devices has adopted traditional MultiTap as the control group device when input performances were compared. Yet, the ecological signiÔ¨Åcance of such a control group is now no longer adequate. Therefore, the iPhone virtual keyboard was used as the device of the control group and compared with the two new methods. The measured results of the virtual keyboard in our experiment, namely, a mean text entry rate of 18.49 wpm and a mean error rate of 7.7%, showed no obvious difference from the results obtained by MacKenzie et al. (2009). After the three methods were compared, it was discovered that MemoryTap, which took only 72 min of learning, performed as well as the virtual keyboard in terms of typing speed and error rate. By contrast, MagArea performed the worst in terms of typing speed but performed the best in terms of error rate.

Learning curves of different chording methods.  Also, by referring to relevant literature, the authors compared the learning performances of different chording text entry devices, as shown in Fig. 8. Subsequently, the same length of learning time was put into the regression formulas for those devices to obtain their estimated performances. To be exact, the learning curve for- the MemoryTap text entry was y ¬º 6.40x0.363, mula for for the MagArea text entry it was y ¬º 7.42x0.232, for ChordTap, which is applied to the Ô¨Çip cellphone with three keys on its back, it was y ¬º 8.41x0.241 (Wigdor, 2004), for TiltText, which depends on the tilted directions of the cellphone, (Wigdor and Balakrishnan, 2003), and for Twiddler, which is operated with a single hand, y ¬º 4.90x0.578 (Lyons et al., 2006). From the above, it can be seen that the chording text entry methods developed by the authors need only a short period of learning time to achieve better input performance than the other chording text entry methods. The most interesting thing is that MagArea has a learning curve similar to that of ChordTap, which also uses three keys to conduct chording text entry. By contrast, Twiddler, which is available in the market, has a lower learning baseline, but a higher learning index. There- fore, based on its learning curve, it is estimated that the user will have to spend 18 hours in learning before he/she can achieve the same input rate as that of MemoryTap.  y ¬º 7.68x0.213  7.  Conclusion  Based on the rules of ergonomic manual operation and cognitive load, the authors have developed two chording text entry methods, namely MagArea text entry and MemoryTap text entry, which combine physical and virtual keys. In addition to ergonomic factors that were considered carefully in the design process, the main contributions include raising input efÔ¨Åciency and reducing error rates, as indicated by the experimental results. In consequence, the two methods will satisfy users‚Äô requirements, perform better than their previous counterparts in terms of learning performance, and enhance users‚Äô motivation as well as operational performance.

s0003687013002226,"  Mobility refers to one‚Äôs ability to identify the relation between their position and the objects in the environment and then move independently, safely and efÔ¨Åciently (Kuyk et al., 2010). The most obvious problem faced by blind persons is moving around in their environment without bumping into unexpected obstacles (Molton et al., 1998). Obstacle detection is thus one of the major problems to be solved to ensure safe navigation. The white cane is the most popular and traditional navigation aid for the visually impaired (Molton et al., 1998; Snaith et al., 1998; Dakopoulos and Bourbakis, 2010) in spite of modern technology-based devices (Clark-Carter et al., 1986; Schellingerhout et al., 2001). The white cane is the simplest, cheapest and most reliable device thus far. It can be generally applied to detect static obstacles on the ground, uneven surfaces, holes and stairs (Cardin et al., 2007). However, the reach of the cane is limited (Yasumuro et al., 2003) and obstacles not located on the ground are hardly detected. A number of electronic travel aids (ETAs) for the visually impaired have been developed for navigation and obstacle detec- tion/avoidance. Dakopoulos and Bourbakis (2010) presented a comparative survey among portable/wearable obstacle detection/ avoidance systems for the visually impaired. Cardin et al. (2007)  * Corresponding author.

The common ETA features based upon new technologies in the literature may conclude that information was gathered from the environment using sonar, laser scanner or stereo camera vision. The user was generally informed through auditory and/or tactile sense (Cardin et al., 2007; Dakopoulos and Bourbakis, 2010). Other fea- tures and disadvantages of ETAs are brieÔ¨Çy summarized as follows. The signal processing of many novel ETAs usually required complicated computer algorithms to provide more complete in- formation about nearby obstacles (Cardin et al., 2007; Sainarayanan et al., 2007). The sensors in some ETAs could only detect obstacles on the ground just like the white cane. Other ETAs had more functional body protection capabilities (e.g., shoulder protection, Cardin et al., 2007). Some ETAs were small, light and handheld, e.g., Miniguide (Phillips, 1998), while other ETAs were bulky, e.g., Nav- belt (Shoval et al., 1994) and GuideCane (Ulrich and Borenstein, 2001), making them difÔ¨Åcult to hold or carry when needed. Although some aids were portable, they still required manual operation (e.g. Ghiani et al., 2009), making co-incident use of conventional aids difÔ¨Åcult or impossible (e.g., white canes). One or more cameras in some ETAs required mounting on headgear (Sainarayanan et al., 2007) or the frame of eyeglasses for obstacle capture (Meers and Ward, 2005 cited in Dakopoulos and Bourbakis, 2010). Such devices may be not accepted by some visually impaired individuals because they may feel cumbersome or embarrassed to wear in public places. Some ETAs required extensive training  0003-6870/$ e see front matter √ì 2013 Elsevier Ltd and The Ergonomics Society. All rights reserved. http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2013.10.012  
818  C.-L. Lee et al.  / Applied Ergonomics 45 (2014) 817e824  periods (Snaith et al., 1998). The relatively high cost of ETAs avail- able in the market is a discouraging feature. To Ô¨Åll the detection gaps in the white cane and overcome the disadvantages of ETAs, a compact size, lightweight, low-cost and simple detection feedback obstacle detection device was developed and explored in this study. The prototype of this detector was developed and evaluated using blindfolded sighted and visually impaired participants in travel experiments. This study hypothe- sized that different travel aid devices would alter walking efÔ¨Åciency and obstacle detection for visually impaired persons. The aims of this study were to compare ETA walking efÔ¨Åciency and obstacle detection capability using both blindfolded sighted and visually impaired participants under three test conditions.  2. Method  2.1.  Survey of mobility needs  At the start of obstacle detector development a survey of visually impaired students was conducted to determine their mobility needs in daily life. Participants were interviewed individually using a constructed questionnaire. The data were then recorded by re- searchers. The Ô¨Årst part of the questionnaire contained the partic- ipant‚Äôs personal data which included name, gender, age, educational level, blind or visually impaired condition, peripheral (side) vision, awareness of light, colour vision and any other impairment. The second part asked for travel experiences including daily activities, use of travel aids and obstacle collision experiences in the environment. Several discussions were held with teachers, who were blind and teaching in the school, to modify the questions before the interview was performed. The purpose of this study was clearly explained to the participants prior to the interview. Informed consent to participate was obtained from the participants in this study. Thirty-one participants were junior high and senior high stu- dents from a school for the visually impaired in Central Taiwan. The students had received at least six-month training in orientation and mobility before joining this study. During the interview one student was determined to have a learning disability, and thus, was elimi- nated from the study. A total of 30 valid participants included 15 junior high school students (aged 13e15, 9 males and 6 females) and 15 senior high school students (aged 16e19, 9 males and 6 females). As self-reported during the interview, 25 students (83.3%) said they were blind and 5 classiÔ¨Åed themselves as having low vision, 27 (90.0%) with congenital impairment and 3 with acquired impairment. All interviewed participants lived at school during the weekdays and could choose to return home or stay at school during weekends and holidays. This study (including a survey and an obstacle detection experiment) was approved by the Institutional Review Board for Ergonomics Experiment of Chaoyang University of Technology.  2.2.  Travel aid development  2.2.1. Obstacle detector  The obstacle detector developed in this study was based upon an automobile parking sensor, consisting of 3 main modules; a sensing module with transmitting and receiving functions, a pro- cessing module and a warning module. Table 1 shows the di- mensions and photos of the ultrasonic obstacle detector modules. The detector architecture is illustrated in Fig. 1. The detection sys- tem works by sending out ultrasonic pulses that are reÔ¨Çected back to the sensor by obstacles within the sensor detection envelope. The reÔ¨Çected signals are processed by the processing module,  the user that  which in turn activates the warning buzzer to alert there is an obstacle in the travel path. The three detector modules were commercial electronic parts packed as a set used for obstacle detection while car-parking. The default distance sensitivity setting of the sensor was adjusted to a lower level for this study. Another detection system modiÔ¨Åcation was made for the detector power connection. A 12 V dry battery was sufÔ¨Åcient for detector use by an individual. A 12 V battery with 2 Ah capacity was used to supply the experiment with sufÔ¨Åcient operational time during a day. The obstacle detector was small and lightweight, as shown in Table 1. One sensing module was mounted on the participant‚Äôs body with the other two modules placed in a small bag on a belt worn on the waist or in a pocket. Two sensors were attached to the participant‚Äôs chest and waist, respectively, during the experiment. The reason for this arrangement was to test if the detector could effectively detect obstacles not located on the ground. The sensor detection envelope was investigated in the labora- tory before the detector was assessed in the Ô¨Åeld. A high Ô¨Çat wooden board (height 245.4 cm, width 32.5 cm) and three uni- versity students were employed to move around as targets for detection envelope measurements. The mean age of these students was 27.0 yr/SD 2.6 yr; mean body height 165.6 cm/SD 4.6 cm; and mean body weight 60.3 kg/SD 10.8 kg. The test direction was varied every 5 from the midesaggital plane to the right and left sides. Each angle for each target was tested twice. Another test for detection distance was performed at the university campus after the laboratory test. The obstacles on the campus included the iron railings outside a building and in an athletic Ô¨Åeld, the net in a volleyball court, the bonnet of sedans and the stairways. An indi- vidual (stature 163.3 cm and body weight 68.4 kg) was asked to wear a sensor on his chest (120.4 cm) in the test. A parking lot gate arm (7.5 cm in width) was also tested in a parking lot by the indi- vidual with a sensor worn on his waist.  2.2.2.  Evaluation of  the electronic obstacle detector  Two experimental stages were performed for obstacle detection evaluation in this study. Five blindfolded sighted participants (4 males and 1 female) who were graduate students at the university were recruited to detect obstacles in a simulated environment. Fifteen visually impaired participants (10 males and 5 females) were then invited to travel a real world mobility route. The visually impaired participants included 5 junior high school students, 6 senior high school students and 4 teachers from a visually impaired school in Central Taiwan. These participants were totally blind with no residual vision. Thirteen suffered from congenital visual impairment. All visually impaired participants had received at least six-month training in orientation and mobility prior to this study. Table 2 shows the participants‚Äô personal data and anthropometric measurements. A corridor 30 m long outside the laboratory at the university was used as a simulated route for the Ô¨Årst experimental stage. Nine obstacles existed in the corridor, including 5 purposefully placed obstacles (1 bicycle, 2 chairs, and 2 overhanging cardboard boxes) arranged in the middle of the corridor and 4 natural obstacles (2 shoe cabinets and 2 shelves) situated against the corridor walls. The positions of the purposefully placed obstacles were changed for each test and each participant. No arrival time was recorded at each checkpoint (i.e., the obstacle location) in this experimental stage and only the total time for each test was recorded. The route around the school campus travelled by visually impaired participants was used for the second-stage test. The route shown in Fig. 2 was determined based upon the concern for the participant‚Äôs transportation safety when the experiment was pro- posed and discussed with the school staff. Eight obstacles were

The purposefully placed obstacles consisted of 2 bicycles/motorcycles and 1 hanging cardboard box. Their locations were varied for each test condition and each participant. Five natural obstacles existed in the path, including a plant terrace, a tall tree, a pedestrian overpass, a side-door and a tilted tree. Ten checkpoints in the path, shown in Fig. 2, consisted of 3 locations on the pedestrian overpass and 7 locations at the other obstacles. The arrival time to each of these 10 checkpoints in the path was recorded for each test condition and each participant. Three experimental test conditions were completed by both blindfolded sighted and visually impaired participants: (1) using a white cane only, (2) using the obstacle detector only and (3) using both devices together. The test conditions were selected at random for each participant in the experiment. A collision prevention strategy regarding participant safety during the experiment was stated as follows. A collision risk assessment was conducted to ensure the safety of participants before the experiment was performed. A pilot test was performed by an experimenter with and without a blindfold in order to observe the possible collisions before and after the collision  Obstacle  Transmitting unit  Receiving unit  Control host  Buzzer  Fig. 1.

The possible parts of ob- stacles that might be collided with by the participant‚Äôs body during the experiment were wrapped with foam instead of asking the participant to wear personal protective equipment such as helmet and gloves. This was done because observing the participant‚Äôs be- haviours after obstacle collision was one of the major study pur- poses. Several instructions were given to the participants before the experiment: (a) Participants had the possibility of body collision with obstacles on the footpath during the experiment. Such ob- stacles were wrapped with foam and might exist at ground, waist or head level. (b) Although measures to minimize the risk for injury had been taken, participants could still suffer light impact with obstacles when collisions occurred during the experiment. (c) An experimenter would follow the participant on the path during the experiment to protect the participant from any injury. When an orientation loss took place or before a harmful collision occurred the experimenter would guide the participant with verbal warn- ings or/and hand(s). (d) Participants had the option to withdraw from the experiment any time. A clear explanation of the experimental objectives and pro- cedures was given to ensure no difÔ¨Åculties in operating the experimental aids by the participants. A brief training period for both blindfolded sighted and visually impaired participants was provided to ensure enough practice and familiarity with the tests before actual data were collected. A written consent from each participant was obtained and the anthropometric data were measured. For test conditions 2 and 3 (i.e., a detector included), two sensing modules were worn on each participant‚Äôs chest and waist to detect possible collisions by the head or waist. Both Ô¨Ånish time and collision frequency of three test conditions for each participant were recorded to determine whether different test conditions

A warning sound was delivered to the participants by a buzzer. An experimenter followed the participant on the footpath, could hear the warning sound and record the participant‚Äôs behaviour during the experiment. Post-experiment interviews regarding the useful- ness of the travel aids were carried out after the participant had completed all three test conditions. Finish time (FT) was deÔ¨Åned as the time required for one participant to complete one test condition. Collision frequency (CF) was considered only when participants collided unintentionally with the obstacles. If the participants walked into and made contact with an obstacle on the route with their white cane or when an alarm sounded and the participant recognized that an obstacle lay ahead in test conditions 2 and 3, tentative actions were usually taken by participants to try to determine the characteristics of the obstacles. Such behaviour would be considered an intentional collision and was not counted in CF in this study.  2.2.3. Data analysis  Finish time and collision frequency under three different test conditions from 5 blindfolded sighted and 15 visually impaired participants were obtained in the experiment. Data were analysed using one-way ANOVA using SPSS 10.0 for Windows. When the main effect was signiÔ¨Åcant, a post hoc analysis using Duncan‚Äôs new multiple range test was applied to evaluate differences among test conditions. All signiÔ¨Åcance levels were set at alpha ¬º 0.05.  3. Results  3.1. Mobility needs  The questionnaire results showed that 90.0% of the participants often used a white cane when going out alone. Ninety percent of the visually impaired did not use white canes in familiar  environments such as school or home. The places visited most frequently included stores (73%), relatives‚Äô/friends‚Äô homes (50%), and restaurants (30%). Fig. 3 shows four obstacle types that the participants often collided with while navigating. Both the auto- mobile/motorcycle (70%) and piled item/protrusion (63%) obtained the highest obstacle collision percentage. Fig. 4 illustrates the body parts that were most often collided with obstacles and expected to avoid obstacle-colliding. All participants expressed that they had never used electronic travel aids before but would like to try if available. The low cost, convenient aids were of greatest interest for all participants.  3.2.  Experiment  3.2.1. Mobility performance data  Fig. 5 shows the sensor detection envelopes obtained from two tests using a high Ô¨Çat wooden board and three persons as targets in the laboratory. The farthest and shortest detection distances were about 228 cm and 43 cm when the sensor was placed right ahead of the wooden board (i.e., 0 in the Ô¨Ågure) and at 50 to the mide sagittal plane of the person. The sensor did not detect the wooden board or three persons at angle ranges beyond 50 . The detection distance measured at the university campus after the laboratory test ranged from 72.5 to 152.3 cm for different obstacles, including iron railings, volleyball net, sedan bonnet and stairways. A parking lot gate arm that protruded about the individual‚Äôs waist height (105 cm) could be detected. Figs. 6 and 7 show the Ô¨Ånish time (FT) and collision frequency (CF) means obtained from 5 blindfolded sighted and 15 visually impaired participants under the three test conditions. The shortest Ô¨Ånish time was found using the white cane plus detector test condition for both blindfolded sighted and visually impaired par- ticipants. The maximum differences in FT among the visually impaired participants were 235.4 s using the white cane only, 213.4 s using the detector only, and 156.9 s using both aids together. The FT values varied markedly among the visually impaired par- ticipants under the same test condition, however, such results were  Subject  80%  70%  60%  50%  40%  30%  20%  10%  0%  70%  63%  20%  17%  Automobile/ motorcycle  piled item/ protrusion  step  Table/chair  Obstacle type  Fig. 2.

No CF values were obtained under the white cane plus detector condition for both blindfolded sighted and visually impaired participants. The statistical analysis results revealed that both Ô¨Ånish time and collision frequency for the visually impaired participants showed signiÔ¨Åcant differences among the three test conditions (F(2, 42) ¬º 6.935, p ¬º .002, and F(2, 42) ¬º 63.7, p ¬º .000). The Duncan‚Äôs groupings for both FT and CF were then obtained by test condition (a ¬º .05) and present in Figs. 6 and 7, respectively. Among the three test conditions, the test using both devices pro- duced the smallest FT. The test with the white cane only produced the largest CF among the three conditions.  3.2.2.  Post-experiment interview  All blindfolded sighted participants stated that they did not feel conÔ¨Ådent in detecting obstacles while using the detector only. For the other two test conditions they felt more conÔ¨Ådent because the white cane was included. However, they all reported positive when the detector was used in the experiment and agreed that the de- tector was useful in detecting obstacles not located on the ground. The post-experiment interview results for the visually impaired participants are listed in Table 4. Eleven participants (73.4%) were satisÔ¨Åed or very satisÔ¨Åed with current detector prototype, and 12 (80.0%) were satisÔ¨Åed or very satisÔ¨Åed with the prototype weight. Thirteen participants (86.7%) expressed that the travel aid was really helpful to their mobility and their conÔ¨Ådence in mobility could be enhanced (80.0%). In response to questions about their preference for the devices used in this experiment, all participants preferred to rely upon the white cane due to its reliability when only one device could be chosen. However, using both devices would be their best choice if the obstacle detector was available for use.  4. Discussion  4.1. Mobility needs  The questionnaire inquired into the participant‚Äôs vision status (total blindness and low vision), light perception and colour vision. The visually impaired participants recruited for the experiment were totally blind with no residual vision. The participants‚Äô vision status was not reconÔ¨Årmed with eye examinations. Their answers to these questions were kept conÔ¨Ådential. However, there might be bias in the study survey results. The participants were allowed to choose more than one answer (item) in the questionnaire regarding the obstacle types that they

Seventy percent of the visually impaired par- ticipants, shown in Fig. 3, expressed that automobile/motorcycle was the most common obstacle that they often collided with. Au- tomobiles or motorcycles are allowed to be parked on the roadside in Taiwan. Occasionally automobiles or motorcycles are illegally parked on the sidewalk. Visually impaired persons therefore may easily meet and collide with them while walking in the street. The participants were allowed to answer with more than one body part that often collided with obstacles. The result shown in Fig. 4 indi- cated that head collisions (57%) occurred almost as often as leg collisions (60%). However, there are far fewer head level obstacles than leg level obstacles in a natural environment. This might be explained as follows. A head collision is a serious event and the participant was more likely to remember head collision incidences than other body part collision incidences. The high rate of reported head collisions might simply reÔ¨Çect the long-lasting memory of painful head collisions instead of the true frequency of head colli- sion incidences. Therefore, the highest desire was to avoid head collisions, which seemed to be a reasonable assessment, with the highest percentage (50%) among body parts.

The white cane was insufÔ¨Åcient to protect the head, hands and waist while walking. Head collision was the participant‚Äôs strongest desire to avoid. Additionally, the cost and ease-of-use of travel aids were also a great concern. This motivated the development of a low cost electronic detector with a warning for obstacles near the head and waist of the visually impaired. The limitations of this survey were that the sample size was small, the participants were young and their travel environment was restricted mostly to a school campus or several limited sites that they frequently visited. Future surveys must collect larger samples with a wide range of ages and visual impairment for further statistical analysis.  4.2.  Evaluation of aids  The longest Ô¨Ånish time (FT) was found in the test condition using only a detector for both blindfolded sighted and visually impaired. All blindfolded sighted and visually impaired participants had no previous experience using a detector and were observed to walk forward slowly and carefully when using only the detector during the experiment. It was also found that the mobility speed varied markedly among participants. An individual‚Äôs walking habit partly accounted for the speed difference. The shortest FT appeared in the condition where both devices were used together. The body protection (for head, waist/hands, and legs) was also enhanced and the collision frequency (CF) decreased. The mobility performance and body protection using  
C.-L. Lee et al.  / Applied Ergonomics 45 (2014) 817e824  823  both devices used together were the highest in all test conditions. Using a detector only protected the user‚Äôs body parts better than the white cane but was worse in mobility speed. The experimental results veriÔ¨Åed the study hypotheses. This is consistent with the results of Snaith et al. (1998) and Cardin et al. (2007) that the white cane is a major mobility aid and other aids can assist with the cane‚Äôs deÔ¨Åciency. The developed detector did augment the white cane. Participants walking with both devices together would obtain more information about obstacles ahead and their conÔ¨Å- dence in mobility might be increased. This Ô¨Ånding could be observed from the post-experiment interview results, in which all participants expressed positive comments for the presence of the detector. It should be noted that the beneÔ¨Åt of using the cane and the detector together only occurred in Ô¨Ånish time, not in obstacle collision. There was no signiÔ¨Åcant difference in obstacle collision between the detector alone condition and the white cane plus detector condition. Visually impaired participants received mobility and orientation training prior to this study. They could more easily adopt coping strategies and obtain more conÔ¨Ådence with their mobility needs. It was observed that they showed good navigation behaviour during the experiment. However, the study results showed that visually impaired participants gained greater Ô¨Ånish times. The difference in Ô¨Ånish time between visually impaired and blindfolded sighted participants might result from the travel routes selected for the experiment. The route around the school campus navigated by visually impaired participants was to some extent complicated. There were 3 turning points, 1 pedestrian overpass, 1 plant terrace and 1 side-door on the route. This route was longer than that travelled by the blindfolded sighted participants. Visually impaired participants sometimes deviated from the planned path during the experiment and the actual travel distance became larger when an orientation loss took place. However, path deviation and orienta- tion loss were found in only a few instances for blindfolded sighted participants because the test route was straight, Ô¨Çat and shorter. Additionally, the blindfolded sighted participants usually waited at laboratory for the experiment and basically knew the route and the obstacles before they were blindfolded. Therefore, blindfolded sighted participants would have much shorter Ô¨Ånish times. The preliminary test for the travel aid detection function (i.e., white cane and detector), observed from blindfolded sighted participants, was the purpose for the Ô¨Årst experimental stage. Observing visually impaired participants‚Äô behaviour during the experiment was the purpose of the second stage. The navigation performance com- parison between these two groups was not the original experiment design in this study. The detector developed in this study could not differentiate the characteristics of obstacles. The warning sound simply raised the alertness level of the participant and prompted the participant to take cautious actions. It was observed that the participants always moved with their hand(s) raised forward and upward when the buzzer sounded under test conditions 2 and 3 (i.e., a detector included). They also swung their white cane vigorously when an obstacle was detected by the white cane. They adopted these ac- tions to determine what and where the obstacles were. They then lowered their head or stooped down to avoid head collisions, side- stepped away from an obstacle on the ground with hands touching or/and with the white cane swinging. A loss of orientation usually occurred for most participants after they collided with an obstacle during the experiment. Visually impaired persons should decrease their walking speed to avoid an accidental collision. Additionally, they should be trained how to solve the orientation loss problem while collisions happen during navigation. The warning signal for the obstacles ahead was the only in- formation provided by the detector. This has been generally  sufÔ¨Åcient in most situations for the visually impaired to take action and avoid possible collisions. The developed device was small in size and lightweight. One or more sensing modules can be easily worn or attached to user body sites such as the head, chest, waist, hand or other body part to detect obstacles. One advantage of the current detection system is that it is hands free. At the travel aid development stage pilot trials were performed to test the detection system capabilities. The warning signal frequently sounded in trials with the original detection system (i.e., without any sensor modiÔ¨Åcation). It was observed that objects located a little farther on the side of the road and within the detection envelope might be detected by the sensor. However, such objects did not obstruct the users‚Äô movement. The sensor default distance sensitivity setting was adjusted to a lower level. The detection system then worked reasonably. This sensor adjustment avoided false alarms while walking and successfully met the obstacle detection demands of this study. The distance envelope obtained with the test using a wooden board as the target was larger than that used by the sample in- dividuals (Fig. 5). This result was fair because more reÔ¨Çected sig- nals were received from the Ô¨Çat board by the ultrasonic sensor due to its smooth surface. A certain amount of reÔ¨Çected signals occurred from an individual, however, these signals became scattered and could not be received by the detector. This decreased the effective detection distance. Furthermore, the detection distance varied for different obstacles tested at the university campus after the laboratory test. It was found that the sensor distance envelope could be affected by several factors such as the body movement while walking, the individual‚Äôs clothing, the body sites where sensors were attached and the obstacle features (e.g., dimensions, appearance, and surface roughness). Users should be aware that the sensor detection distance is target and direction dependent. The visually impaired participants were not told or did not ask about the nature and number of obstacles appearing on the route as well as whether the same route was used for all three tests during the experiment. Three test conditions were completed in random order by each participant and the locations of the purposefully placed obstacles were varied in each condition. The experimental results could be used to reasonably explore the usefulness and make a comparison analysis of the tested devices. However, a familiar test environment might lead to insufÔ¨Åcient generalizability of the FT and CF results. Eight obstacles were scattered over a 138-m path with no two obstacles within the detection envelop at the same time in this study. However, the participants were not told that there was only one obstacle when the warning sounded. They always behaved as described above when an obstacle was detected. In a realistic environment the warning sound might be continuous. If this occurs it is suggested that the user turn the detector off and use a white cane or other suitable travel aid instead. This might be the limita- tion of using this detector. The experimental results presented positive responses to the detector. However, detector improvement is still needed. To enhance user convenience the detection device system should be designed with a user-friendly interface and wireless function. A vibro-tactile feedback and earphone function should also be pro- vided to ensure the warning signals are received by users who are deaf/blind or in a noisy environment. Furthermore, a global posi- tioning system (GPS) may be taken into account in detection sys- tem development to provide location information for the visually impaired in outdoor navigation. The current developed detector provides only information that a detected obstacle is in front and nearby. If the actual position of the  
824  C.-L. Lee et al.  / Applied Ergonomics 45 (2014) 817e824  obstacle (i.e., appearing on the left side, right side, upper level, or lower level of the user) can be provided the user may more easily take correct action to avoid obstacle collision. Future work should be done regarding this suggestion: (1) the feasibility of manufacturing such a detector prototype/product, (2) experiments conducted for detection performance and (3) a training course for the user.  5.  Conclusions  A compact, lightweight, simple detection feedback, easy-to-use, low-cost obstacle detection device for the visually impaired was developed in this study. The results showed that the developed detector could augment the user‚Äôs performance with a white cane. To achieve the best mobility performance and body protection ef- fect, the obstacle detection device should be used in conjunction with the white cane.

s0003687013002238,"  In-vehicle information systems (IVISs) in automobiles are becoming more and more complex due to their increasing levels of functionality, which are related to multimedia services. IVISs include various functions such as navigation, music or video players, and TV, as well as standard radio or air conditioning con- trollers. However, multitasking such as manipulating IVISs while driving can cause interference between the primary driving tasks and the secondary IVIS operating tasks. For example, performing a search for music (Mitsopoulos-Rubens et al., 2011; Young et al., 2012) or navigation (Choi et al., 2013) while driving increased the  * Corresponding author.

Kim).  amount of time that drivers spent with their eyes off the roadway and decreased their ability to maintain constant lane position. These types of interference might be heightened when the two tasks require the use of the same driving modalities (Brookhuis et al., 1991; Tsimhoni et al., 2004), i.e. the visual, auditory, cogni- tive, and physical dimensions. Thus, operating an IVIS while driving can divide drivers‚Äô attention, thereby degrading their performance in terms of both driving the car and manipulating the IVIS (Alm and Nilsson, 1995; Horrey et al., 2006; Janelle et al., 1999; Salvucci, 2001) and inducing accidents (Stutts et al., 2001). Therefore, many automobile design guidelines have recommended that manipulating several disruptive IVIS functions (e.g. scrolling through a map or searching for an address) while driving should be prohibited (CEC, 2007; Green, 1999; JAMA, 2004). Traditionally, touch screens or physical controllers such as hard buttons or knobs (e.g. BMW iDrive) have been used to operate IVISs.  0003-6870/$ e see front matter √ì 2013 Elsevier Ltd and The Ergonomics Society.

790  H. Kim, H. Song / Applied Ergonomics 45 (2014) 789e798  Recently, a touchpad located in the steering wheel has been used to improve the usability of IVISs (Kim et al., 2009). Also, many studies have focused on non-touch or touchless gestures based on vision techniques. Manipulating IVISs with non-touch gestures may cause less interruption to primary driving tasks, thereby lessening the task load and allowing the task completion time to decrease signiÔ¨Åcantly (Karam and Shraefel, 2005; Karam et al., 2009; Pirhonen et al., 2002). In comparison with hard buttons or touch pads, touch screens are being applied in IVISs because they allow direct manipulation of devices. Moreover, operating with Ô¨Ånger gestures enables interac- tion between users and interfaces to be more intuitive and efÔ¨Åcient. However, touch screens may be cumbersome because of the lack of touch and kinesthetic cues, which are highly important in the safe control of cars (Burnett and Porter, 2001; Burnett and Irune, 2009). Lacking such characteristics, the operation performance on un- sealed roads or conditions of high vibration will become impaired (Salmon et al., 2011). Particularly, touch gestures on touch screens have limitations because there are difÔ¨Åculties in providing visual cues and tactile feedback for the gestures on the screen (St√∂√üel and Blessing, 2010). Bj√∏rneseth et al. (2012) showed that traditional touch-screen button and menu interaction was quicker and less erroneous than multi-touch gestures in a safety critical maritime domain. Bach et al. (2008) demonstrated that controlling IVISs using touch buttons was more rapid and efÔ¨Åcient than manipu- lating such systems with hard buttons or touch gestures. On the contrary, the study insisted that touch gestures demanded less vi- sual attention from users. Alpern and Minardo (2003) showed that handling IVISs using simple touchless gestures, rather than work- ing with the hard buttons, could allow drivers to focus more on their driving activities. Due to this beneÔ¨Åt of the decreased demand on visual attention, many automobile manufacturers are beginning to apply touch or touchless gestures in the manipulation of their IVISs. In particular, touch gestures such as Ô¨Çicking, panning, and pinching are likely to be used widely in IVISs because such gestures are already widely used in smart phones and tablet PCs. Rydstr√∂m et al. (2012) showed that a touch screen interface based on simple tapping operations was better for alphanumeric input tasks, but was worse for continuous adjustments and list scrolling. Touch gestures such as Ô¨Çicking and panning might make worse tasks better. However, the effects on safe driving of operating IVISs using these touch gestures remain unknown. In order to verify whether these touch gestures are appropriate for operating IVISs while driving, the following three aspects should be considered. First, each glance duration for a touch gesture should not require more than 1.5 s, so that drivers are not visually distracted from their driving task. Time is required to visually pay attention to IVISs during the performance of touch gestures, but not to cognitive or manual processing. Drivers tend to restrict their eyes-off-the-road-time to 1.5 s (Rockwell, 1988); the possibility of car accidents increases as this time increases over 2.0 s (Klauer et al., 2006; Zwahlen et al., 1988). ISO15005 also recommends that the time that drivers‚Äô eyes dwell on the IVIS should be less than 1.5 s (glance duration ¬º transition time √æ dwell time; ISO15007-1, 2002). In particular, operating IVISs using touch gestures should not require drivers to pay continuous visual attention to the device (ISO15005, 2002). Therefore, an evaluation of the visual attention demanded by a device is essential in order to reveal the safety of using touch gestures while driving. There is a ‚Äú15-Second Rule‚Äù that is a simple heuristic for evaluating attention load on a task (Green, 1999). This heuristic indicates that tasks that can be completed within 15 s in a stationary car may be safe without an increased risk of car accidents while driving. Furthermore, the visual occlusion technique is being widely applied for the evaluation of the visual demands in the automobile  industry (Young et al., 2003; Stevens et al., 2004; Gelau and Krems, 2004; Foley, 2008). While driving, drivers‚Äô eyes primarily focus on the road and sometimes on the IVIS. While drivers keep their eyes on the road, they cannot watch the IVIS. Using the occlusion technique, this typical scenario can be simulated by occluding the participants‚Äô eyes so that they cannot continuously watch the device. The use of this technique is much simpler and easier than the development of a driving simulator (Young et al., 2003); furthermore, in order to compare the results of the current study with the experimental re- sults from other studies, the occlusion technique is required because it enables comparisons of standardized experimental methods (Pettitt, 2008). Several studies have demonstrated that the visual occlusion technique is valuable in evaluating drivers‚Äô visual atten- tion load because this technique resulted in loads similar to those found in real driving environments (Baumann et al., 2004; Gelau et al., 2009). Due to these beneÔ¨Åts, the technique is occasionally used in the automobile industry in order to determine what func- tions should be allowed or prohibited while driving. When using the technique, Horberry et al. (2008) recommended that only younger/ middle-aged participants (broadly 17e66 years old) should be used in the occlusion measurement in order to minimize inter-subject variability. Brook-Carter et al. (2009) suggested that the proper sample size was 14 in spite of the size‚Äôs dependency on the vari- ability of the occluded task; within-participant basis was more consistent than between-participants basis. Second, the touch gestures themselves should be intuitive so that drivers can imagine and recall them easily. For example, users can easily associate the ‚Äòsweep up/down‚Äô Ô¨Ånger gestures with scrolling operations; in the same manner, they can also associate ‚Äòsweep left/right‚Äô gestures with the back or forward operations of touch browsers (Ecker et al., 2009). However, unlike the case of touch buttons, providing affordable and intuitive cues for touch gestures on a display is often not achievable because such gestures are not static but dynamic. For example, the zooming function in maps, in which users apply a pinching gesture, is not easily adopted without cues for the gestures; however, the visualization of certain cues on the map can become unnecessary and distracting after users learn the gestures. However, gestures such as Ô¨Çicking, panning, and pinching may be intuitively used in IVISs because such gestures are used widely in smart phones; thus, users already know these gestures without cues. Third, the hand or Ô¨Ånger positions required to make the gestures should be comfortable. Generally, for smart phones or tablets, the users‚Äô wrists are not likely to be stressed because the angle between their wrist and the display surface is almost parallel. However, the angle of an IVIS display on a dashboard in automobiles is usually between 30 and 75 , thereby forcing the users‚Äô wrists to bend more when using touch gestures; users thus can become uncomfortable. The purpose of this study is to verify the safety and usability of operating IVISs using touch gestures while driving. For this pur- pose, an experiment was performed in which the three gestures commonly used in smart phones, i.e. Ô¨Çicking, panning, and pinch- ing, were compared with simple tapping operations in standard IVISs. The participants performed tasks like scrolling through a list, moving a map, and zooming in/out of a map with two devices that could be operated only by touch gestures or common touch but- tons. Then, the usability and safety of the Ô¨Çicking, panning, and pinching gestures were evaluated in terms of the abovementioned three aspects of visual attention, intuitiveness, and operational usability. In order to measure the visual attention load required for each gesture while driving, the visual occlusion technique was employed in the experiment. Initial gestures performed by the participants and their wrist motions were analyzed to evaluate the intuitiveness and usability of each touch gesture.

s0003687013002287,"  A growing body of literature has examined the extent of work- place violence internationally (Chappell and Di Martino, 2006; Kelloway et al. 2006). At a time when other forms of violence in society appear to be on the decline, research suggests that work- place violence is increasing (Estrada et al., 2010), including violence as a leading form of occupational fatality (Menendez et al., 2013). This is reÔ¨Çected in the European Agency for Safety and Health at Work report (2010), which forecasted workplace violence to be one of the important emerging issues facing organisations. Despite a growing interest in this psychosocial phenomenon from researchers and international and national bodies concerned with safety and injury prevention, the ergonomics literature has largely ignored workplace violence to date. While ergonomics has contributed to the literature on other psychosocial risks e often in the context of musculoskeletal disorders and notably stress (e.g. Eatough et al., 2012), and working hours and fatigue (e.g. Bohle et al., 2011) e just two peer-reviewed articles on the problem of workplace violence were identiÔ¨Åed (using the search term  * Corresponding author.

These two articles were concerned with violence, bullying and other psychological risks among Turkish workers (Aytac et al., 2011) and violence and ergonomic prevention (Choe, 2000). Neither article applied a systems approach to the problem of workplace violence. During this period, more than 400 articles on the topic appeared in medicine journals and hundreds more in nursing, management and safety-related journals. Much of this literature on workplace violence dealt with descriptive epidemiology focusing on speciÔ¨Åc industry sectors, with few arti- cles considering broader systemic concerns or focusing in more depth at risk factors and preventive measures. The absence of a contribution to the Ô¨Åeld by ergonomics is surprising as ergonomics, as a systems discipline, has an important role to play in under- standing workplace violence risk and effective measures for its prevention. Like other occupational health and safety risks, violence in the workplace is related to the broad work system (rather than being a strictly interpersonal conÔ¨Çict problem) and can be understood in terms of interactions between individual, task, environment, and organisational work system elements. Moreover, the analysis and design of these system components are key to an effective violence prevention initiative.

Having Ô¨Årst examined the extent and nature of violence cases in a sample of organisations from a wide range of New Zealand industry sectors, the paper ex- plores health and safety managers‚Äô perceptions of risk for the different aspects of the work system, and current measures to manage risk amongst respondent‚Äôs organisations from the perspective of a systems model of violence control.  1.1. Workplace violence in New Zealand and internationally  Workplace violence is a relatively recent consideration under New Zealand health and safety law. Introduced in 1992, the Health and Safety in Employment Act provided a more systematic approach to hazard management than existed previously under several laws. However, psychological harm and worker participa- tion, two elements highly relevant to workplace violence, were not included in the Act until a 2002 amendment. Consequently, the proÔ¨Åle of such psychosocial issues among industry and government agencies alike is still developing. Following a number of high proÔ¨Åle incidents involving fatal and non-fatal cases of violence against New Zealand employees (Mayhew and Reilly, 2007), exploratory studies explored the extent and nature of violence at work across a range of New Zealand in- dustry sectors (Bentley et al., 2013; Catley et al., 2011). This initial research found relatively high levels of reported workplace violence across the range of surveyed organisations, but most notably in health and public administration workplaces. In the most recent survey (Bentley et al., 2013), a total of nearly 2500 cases of workplace violence were reported by 96 organisations with 436 cases involving some form of physical injury (18% of all reported cases). The incidence rate for all violence cases (32.3 per 1000 employees) was at the high end in relation to internationally re- ported rates, as the discussion below indicates. Highest violence incidence rates and lost-time due to violence injury were reported for organisations from the health sector. However, interpreting prevalence data must be treated with caution due to the considerable variation employed by researchers in the deÔ¨Ånitions, terminology and their operationalisation (Schat et al., 2006). Additionally, the concept of violence is itself often treated in an axiomatic fashion (Catley and Jones, 2002). Yet, the extent of workplace violence reported in international studies does suggest a signiÔ¨Åcant concern in all countries where data on such events are available. Typically, a prevalence range of between 1.5% and 5% is observed for violence experienced by workforces sur- veyed, including 13 per 1000 in the US (Hartley et al., 2005); 2% of Canadian Public Service Employees (Kelloway et al., 2006), 5% of workers in Europe (Parent-Thirion et al., 2007), and 4.9% of UK workers (Jones et al., 2011). Employees at greatest risk of violence include those working in health, public administration, education, transportation and hos- pitality (Chappell and Di Martino, 2006; European Agency for Safety and Health at Work, 2010; Gerberich et al., 2004; Gerberich et al., 2011; Jones et al., 2011; Kowalenko et al., 2013; Pompeii et al., 2013; Schat et al., 2006). Nurses and others work- ing in health care and amongst hospital staff in particular appear to be the most vulnerable occupational groups for assaults from pa- tients, visitors and others (Gerberich et al., 2004; Henry and Ginn, 2002; Chen et al., 2012; Pompeii et al., 2013). Consistent with these international Ô¨Åndings, Bentley et al. (2013) and Catley et al. (2011) found that rates of workplace violence in New Zealand were notably higher among employees working in education, health, public transport and postal services. Counter to the stereotype that workplace violence is typically co-worker aggression, research indicates that the perpetrator of workplace violence is more likely to be e depending on industry e  a patient, hospital visitor, client or customer (Barling et al., 2009; VandenBos and Bulatao, 1996; Chappell and Di Martino, 2006; Chen et al., 2012; Gerberich et al., 2004; Hoobler and Swanberg, 2006; Jones et al., 2011; Jenkins, 1996; Kelloway et al., 2006; Laden and Schwartz, 2000; Pompeii et al., 2013; Schat et al., 2006). These international Ô¨Åndings were supported by the previ- ous surveys conducted by the present authors in New Zealand, with highest risk ratings for non-employee perpetrators, although this varied by industry sector (Bentley et al., 2013; Catley et al., 2011). Health organisations rated patients, customers/clients, and family members as particularly important potential sources of violence, while in education patients and students were highest rated. Although workplace violence is often represented as being about co-worker aggression, co-workers were rated highest for only two industry sectors: ‚Äòmanufacturing and professional‚Äô and ‚ÄòscientiÔ¨Åc and technical services‚Äô. Highest risk factor ratings (as perceived by occupational health and safety managers and others responsible for managing workplace violence) were reported for exposure to un- stable persons, including: alcohol and drug use, prejudice and/or harassment, and mental instability/distress.  1.2. A systems approach to workplace violence  The extent of the workplace violence problem and its impact on individual workers and organisations has led to a considerable body of epidemiological research literature that has investigated risk factors for workplace violence. However, rather less research attention has been focused on measures to prevent violence at work (Campbell et al., 2011; Chappell and Di Martino, 2006; May and Grubbs, 2002). Chappell and Di Martino‚Äôs (2006) conceptual systems model is particularly useful in assisting in risk assessment as it depicts the interactive role of individual, workplace, contextual and societal risk factors in the aetiology of workplace violence events. This model has provided a basis for the collection of risk factor data in the previous New Zealand surveys, with a range of individual and organisation risk factors identiÔ¨Åed as of key importance by respondents. Previous New Zealand studies (Bentley et al., 2013; Catley et al., 2011) have found highest risk factor ratings for individual factors, including exposure to unstable persons, although, interestingly, workloads and time pressure also received relatively high ratings, suggesting poorly organised work and work- related stress increases the perceived risk of violence in the workplace. Indeed, research has indicated that stress can lead to the breakdown of workplace relationships and increase violence risk, while factors such as competition for scarce resources, work intensiÔ¨Åcation and constant change can be important antecedents for workplace violence (Hoad, 1993; Howard and Wech, 2012; Jones et al., 2011). The present study draws on the Chappell and Di Martino (2006) systems model to determine the relative contribution of risk factors in the experience of workplace violence in New Zealand. Moreover, it attempts to understand the violence prevention measures employed by New Zealand organisations from different industry sectors and relates the control options available to managers ac- cording to Catley et al.‚Äôs (2011) conceptual systems model. The model includes four key control dimensions that may be available as a violence control measure to organisations from different sec- tors: (1) behaviour e managing the behaviour of people in and around the workplace; (2) technology e including surveillance and other technology solutions; (3) administrative controls e notably shift scheduling and workload management; and (4) environ- mental design e including factors such as the use of lighting, bar- riers to isolate vulnerable employees from dangerous situations, and workplace layout and design factors. Supporting each of these control dimensions is the organisation‚Äôs health and safety culture e  
T.A . Bentley et al.  / Applied Ergonomics 45 (2014) 839e848  841  principally, a shared understanding of the workplace violence risk and how to manage it, and a communicated commitment at the top of the organisation to prioritise violence control. These control di- mensions are shown in Fig. 1, from the perspective of the control of violence risk to taxi drivers, and as a comparison, retail shop workers. The degree of overlap with the larger circle for each of the four violence measures corresponds to the ability to control each dimension for each sector. In the case of taxi drivers, little control can be exerted over the external environment and work organisa- tion and therefore control activity needs to focus on the other control measures such as technology. This has been well-illustrated in New Zealand where, following a fatal knife attack on a taxi driver, all cabs are legally required to be Ô¨Åtted with a surveillance camera. The presence of cameras has reduced the incidence of attacks on taxi drivers, acting as a deterrent for passengers considering a  Fig. 1. Conceptual model of violence control as applied to the transport (taxi drivers) and retail sectors (adapted from Catley et al., 2011).  verbal or physical attack on the driver. For retail workers, all four dimensions of control can be applied, as the working environment for retail staff is restricted to the store, and technology in the form of surveillance cameras and panic buttons can be readily applied. These factors will in turn inÔ¨Çuence customer behaviour, reducing the risk of violence from an external source further. Work organi- sation, such as ensuring workers are not roistered on late shifts alone, will further reduce the violence risk. There is little published research on organisational attempts to manage the workplace violence problem (Bentley et al., 2013; Dillon, 2012; Wassell, 2009); although the literature that is avail- able suggests that current violence management prevention is inadequate. Dillon (2012), from a review of the literature, reports that nearly 70% of US organisations have no programs or policies to deal with violence. Previous New Zealand studies by the present authors have found just 50% of organisations formally recognised violence as a hazard in the workplace, and many organisations did not formally address violence as part of their risk management activity (Bentley et al., 2013; Catley et al., 2011). The present study seeks to add to this meagre literature by focusing on the prevention activities to control workplace violence used by organisations from the different sectors responding to the survey. Moreover, it con- siders the use of the different control dimensions depicted in Fig. 1.  1.3.  Study aims  The present study, in common with its predecessors, aims to examine the extent and nature of the workplace violence problem in a sample of New Zealand organisations, towards the on-going development of a biennial workplace violence survey that can assist government and industry in monitoring the workplace violence problem, identify key areas of risk and develop in- terventions that target these areas. The study had four speciÔ¨Åc aims:  i)  ii)  iii)  iv)  to determine the extent and nature of cases of workplace violence (including assault on both people and property) among a sample of New Zealand organisations from a variety of industry sectors to identify the major perceived sources of violence/perpe- trators for participating industry sectors to identify perceived key risk factors for workplace violence, in relation to a systems model, from the perspective of different sectors to examine workplace violence control measures presently employed by participating organisations and relate these measures to a systems control model.  2. Method  2.1.  Sample  The sample for the 2012 New Zealand Workplace Violence Survey was drawn from the occupational health and safety pro- fessionals who subscribe to the New Zealand Safeguard Forum e an email-based forum for health and safety professionals hosted by the Safeguard Magazine. Respondents accepted an invitation to participate in the survey posted on the Safeguard Forum site. Approximately 400 individuals subscribe to the Safeguard Forum, although it is unknown how many are practicing OHS professionals or in related Ô¨Åelds, nor how many received the invitation email to participate. Thus, determining an accurate response rate is impos- sible, although the 93 respondents suggest a minimum response rate of approximately 24%.  
842  T.A . Bentley et al.  / Applied Ergonomics 45 (2014) 839e848  2.2.  Procedure, data treatment and analysis  A web-based survey was developed and a message was posted on the Safeguard Site, with the agreement of the site administrator, and emailed to the Forum membership inviting individuals to respond to the survey. Individuals were asked to respond if they either worked in a health and safety management function in an organisation or operated as a consultant or advisor attached mainly to one organisation. The invitation message included a brief infor- mation section outlining the background and aims of the study, and detailing ethics approval for the survey. Respondents were informed that the survey would take approximately 20e30 min to complete (some additional time may have been required to retrieve relevant records from the organisations database). Respondents were also informed that their responses were conÔ¨Ådential and no individual or organisation would be identiÔ¨Åed in the Ô¨Åndings of the study. They were also told they could withdraw from the survey at any point. Participation in the on-line survey was considered to be consent to participate. Once respondents had completed and submitted the survey, the data were automatically transferred to an IBM SPSS spreadsheet, where they were cleaned and prepared for analysis. Analysis was conducted in IBM SPSS for Windows version 20. Analysis involved basic descriptive analysis of all variables, including cross- tabulations between key variables. Qualitative analysis involved thematic content analysis of narrative text describing intervention measures used by organisations, based on the control dimensions framework provided by the Catley et al. (2011) conceptual systems model.  2.3.  Survey design  The on-line survey was divided into four main sections: basic demographical details; reports of workplace violence recorded by the organisation; the respondent‚Äôs views on risk factors for work- place violence in their organisation (this section was divided into four main scales, originally derived from factors included in Chappell and Di Martino‚Äôs (2006) conceptual systems model, con- taining a total of 30 items); and the organisation‚Äôs risk management practices in relation to workplace violence (this section was informed by a number of items used in the US Department of Labour, Bureau of labour Statistics Survey of Workplace Violence Prevention, 2007). While the authors acknowledge that there are competing representations of violence (Catley and Jones, 2002), the respondents were asked to focus on individual physical acts of violence when responding to the questions in Sections 2e4. Throughout the questionnaire the majority of items used Likert- type response scales, while open free-text Ô¨Åelds were used to collect data on preventive measures used by respondents‚Äô organisations.  3. Results  3.1.  Sample demographics  Some 93 health and safety professionals responsible for man- aging workplace violence in their organisations responded to the survey, although seven respondents did not answer a number of question items and their data was excluded from the study. This left a total of 86 usable responses. Participating organisations ranged from the very small to the very large, by New Zealand standards (range: 1e7000 employees), with a mean organisational size of 626, and a total number of staff represented by the 86 organisations of approximately 54,000. Participating organisations were largely located in the main New Zealand cities, and were representative of  Table 1 Reported level of workplace violence for participating organisations.

Almost one-half of the sample was comprised from organisations operating in three in- dustry sectors: manufacturing (26%), construction (11%), transport, postal and warehousing (11%), with a further 7% in health care. The majority of survey respondents were health and safety managers/ advisors/coordinators (60%) or human resource managers/advisors (21%) e the remaining were in general management roles that also had responsibility for health and safety. Respondents had moderate to high experience in their current role, with a mean time in role of just over Ô¨Åve years (sd ¬º 5.5).  3.2. Perceived and reported levels of workplace violence across the sample  Almost 75% of respondents rated the level of risk of workplace violence associated with the work of their organisation as being either ‚Äòvery low‚Äô or ‚Äòlow risk‚Äô on a Ô¨Åve-point scale (very low-very high risk). Just 5% rated the risk of violence to be either ‚Äòhigh‚Äô or ‚Äòvery high‚Äô. Table 1 provides an overview of cases of workplace violence reported by respondents. Despite the low level of perceived risk (evidenced in respondents‚Äô violence risk ratings) associated with workplace violence in the respondents‚Äô organisa- tions, more than one-half reported some form of violent event over the 12-months period. However, the majority of these cases were relatively minor in terms of injury to persons or damage to prop- erty. Some 510 incidents of workplace violence were reported, with 299 of these being physical assaults as opposed to cases of damage to organisational property. The table shows the number of orga- nisations reporting violence cases for the Ô¨Åve different categories of violence employed by the study, with three levels of physical as- sault and two levels of property damage. While the proportion of organisations reporting minor categories of physical assault were high compared to previous studies by the present authors (Bentley et al., 2013), the number of serious harm events was relatively low. Table 2 shows reported incidence of violence by industry sector for those sectors with representation in the survey from at least Ô¨Åve  Table 2 Reported cases of workplace violence by sector.

responding organisations. Highest levels of violence were observed for the agriculture, forestry and construction organisations repre- sented in the sample, this Ô¨Ånding being out of step with most in- ternational studies where health sector violence attracts most research attention. Indeed, previous New Zealand surveys have found health, public sector and transport sectors to report highest violence incidence (Bentley et al., 2013).  3.3.  Perceived sources of workplace violence  Table 3 shows mean ratings of importance of different types of perpetrator as sources of violence in respondents‚Äô organisations, as measured on a Ô¨Åve point Likert-type scale. Overall ratings were approximately even for all sources of violence, although these Ô¨Åg- ures are more meaningful when considered independently for each industry sector. In-line with the previous surveys, health care or- ganisations rated patents (mean: 4.4; sd: 0.55) as a very important source of risk, with customers/clients (3.5; 1.22) also of particularly high importance. While workplace violence is often thought of as being about co- worker aggression, co-workers were highest rated for just three sectors: ‚Äòagriculture, forestry and Ô¨Åshing‚Äô; ‚Äòmanufacturing‚Äô; and ‚Äòconstruction‚Äô. Although these Ô¨Ågures possibly reÔ¨Çect the physical nature of the work in these sectors and attendant masculine cul- tural values, it is more likely a reÔ¨Çection of the lack of exposure to other potential sources of violence in the daily work of most staff. Stranger violence was rated highest in the transport, postal and warehousing sector group, reÔ¨Çecting the nature of the work in the occupational groups represented where exposure to the public outside of the workplace is frequent.  3.4.  Perceived risk factors for workplace violence  Respondents were asked to rate the importance of a set of 29 possible risk factors for workplace violence, derived from the  literature and a conceptual systems model of workplace violence risk constructed by Chappell and Di Martino (2006). Risk factors included in the list were related to the broad work system; covering individual, organisational, and environmental factors. Tables 4e6 show risk factors ratings in terms of importance for workplace violence, organised under these three areas, for sectors where Ô¨Åve or more organisations participated in the survey. Looking Ô¨Årst at the overall ratings of risk (across all sectors), highest mean ratings were reported for interpersonal and organ- isational factors and lowest for environmental. SpeciÔ¨Åc interper- sonal factors with highest mean ratings were: interpersonal communication (mean: 2.62; sd: 1.21); alcohol and drug use (2.43; 1.27); prejudice and/or harassment (2.24; 1.21), and perceived injustice (2.50; 1.33). Similar to the 2010 survey, organisational factors which received the highest mean ratings were workloads (2.53; 1.26) and time pressure (2.60; 1.21), suggesting work-related stress increases the perceived risk of violence in the workplace. Inadequate staff training in managing workplace violence (2.40; 1.21) and exposure to customers/contact with public (2.35; 1.43) were also highly rated across the sample. The relatively low rankings for the environmental risk factors, notably cash on the premises (1.45; 1.02), and working area design/ layout (1.70; 0.95), are likely to reÔ¨Çect the fact that for many re- spondents these factors were a non-issue e i.e. they did not feature in the work of their employees. For the health care sector, the physical location of the workplace (2.33; 1.03) was rated relatively highly, reÔ¨Çecting the impact location and environmental design can have on the work of sector staff and interactions with the public. In-line with the 2007 and 2010 surveys, organisational factors related to workload, time pressure, and organisational communi- cation were notably high for the health, construction and manufacturing sectors, reÔ¨Çecting the high levels of psychological and physical demand in these sectors and stress outcomes which may increase the likelihood of psychosocial problems such as bullying and violence. For the health care sector, working in  Table 3 Perceived sources of workplace violence risk by sector.

isolation/remotely was also a key factor, and inadequate staff training in managing workplace was rated highly by health, con- struction and manufacturing sectors, suggesting a potential area for further intervention to reduce violence risk.  3.5. Managing workplace violence: perceptions of ability to control violence  Respondents were asked to rank the four dimensions of violence control shown in Fig. 1 and identiÔ¨Åed from previous research by these authors (Bentley et al., 2013; Catley et al., 2011) in relation to their importance for their organisation‚Äôs violence prevention stra- tegies. Highest average rankings (i.e. those most often selected as the most important when ordering in relation to the other 3 control dimensions) were reported for behavioural control (mean: 1.56; sd: 0.84), followed by administrative control (2.39; 0.94), environ- mental (2.61; 0.97), and technological (3.43; 0.84). Hence, for most organisations, behaviour was the dimension of control over which there was most focus in relation to their violence prevention stra- tegies while technology received the least focus. Examining these Ô¨Åndings by sector, some sectorial differences in control rankings were observed. Notably, behavioural control is seen as consistently most important in agriculture, forestry and Ô¨Åshing organisations along with health care, while technological control is ranked consistently lowest in health care and relatively high for retail. These Ô¨Åndings have implications for organisations working across different sectors where some categories of inter- vention are either unavailable (e.g. environmental control for postal workers who deliver mail) or difÔ¨Åcult to manage effectively (e.g. behavioural control in health care). In these cases, it is suggested that safety improvements need to be made through improvements to other control dimensions and to health and safety culture with regard to workplace violence and the organisation of work, including administrative measures. Further research by the present authors is exploring the different control options and constraints on control for organisations of different type and from different industry sectors.  3.6. Managing workplace violence: control measures used by responding organisations  The management of workplace violence was identiÔ¨Åed as a priority by 44% of respondents‚Äô organisations, with 5% communi- cating workplace violence risks to their staff ‚Äòoften‚Äô, and a further 62% communicating violence risk at least sometimes. Some 23% of organisations had employed the services of a security specialist in relation to preventing workplace violence. The survey questioned respondents on their organisation‚Äôs health and safety management system in relation to workplace violence. Respondents reported that workplace violence had been formally identiÔ¨Åed as a hazard in 50% of organisations, this Ô¨Ågure being identical to the Ô¨Ånding of the 2010 survey. Some 28% reported having a speciÔ¨Åc risk management plan for workplace violence in place, and a further 28% having a general hazard management plan that included workplace violence; Ô¨Ågures similar to those reported in the international literature (Dillon, 2012). A fairly large propor- tion of respondents (30%) reported that at least some of their em- ployees had had specialist training in relation to workplace violence or related aspects of security. Respondents were also asked to describe measures, in addition to training, that had been put in place in their organisations for the prevention and control of workplace violence. While some of these, for example policy and hazard management, were generic in na- ture, many others appeared to be speciÔ¨Åcally designed for the control and management of the workplace violence problem.

Very few organisations used a combination of control measures in their violence prevention strategy with most relying instead on one, and occasionally, two control measures. However, across the sample a wide range of measures for violence prevention were reported as currently being in use with considerable variation by industry. These responses were content analysed and are presented in Table 7. A summary overview is also provided in Fig. 2, with general intervention categories used to map against each control dimension of the Catley et al. (2011) conceptual model. As shown in Table 7, many of the measures adopted by par- ticipants‚Äô organisations were primary interventions and organ- isational in nature, including the use of anti-harassment policies, staff scheduling, improved supervision of some sites, better com- munications, drug and alcohol policies, and company risk regis- ters. Other interventions were mainly technical, including  Table 7 Control measures used by participating organisations by sector.  personal alarms, panic buttons, customer surveillance, and secu- rity barriers.  4. Discussion  Approximately one-half of all respondents reported one or more cases of workplace violence in their organisation, a Ô¨Ågure consis- tent with earlier New Zealand surveys (Bentley et al., 2013; Catley et al., 2011). These Ô¨Åndings, together with those from interna- tional research, indicate a signiÔ¨Åcant workplace violence problem across some industry sectors, notably, but not limited to, health care. A strong positive from the survey was the propensity for or- ganisations to report attempted assault and minor violence injury cases. This suggests a positive culture in relation to the reporting of less serious workplace violence cases that should be encouraged as lost-time cases can be relatively uncommon in some sectors, thereby restricting the possibility for organisational learning to- wards the prevention of workplace violence.

Summary of respondent organisations‚Äô violence control strategies, mapped against Catley et al.‚Äôs (2011) dimensions of violence control.  The Ô¨Ånding that the source of violence/perpetrator of most concern to respondents varied by sector is unsurprising given previous research (Bentley et al., 2013; United States Department of Labour, 2006; cited in Dillon, 2012, p.16). Co-workers were commonly rated a lower risk than external or clients by some sectors, including health care (Chen et al., 2012; Kowalenko et al., 2013). These Ô¨Åndings are contrary to common notions of co- worker aggression often portrayed in the media, and suggest or- ganisations should consider violence control measures that address all potential sources of workplace violence. The study identiÔ¨Åed a range of risk factors for workplace violence and sought to determine how each risk factor impacts on perceived violence risk for the different industry sectors repre- sented in the study. In keeping with Ô¨Åndings from the previous NZ workplace violence survey, this study has found that organisa- tional, as well as interpersonal, risk factors are seen as an important source of risk for workplace violence (Chappell and Di Martino, 2006). Indeed, factors such as time pressure, workload and communication appear to be very important to violence risk, sug- gesting that poorly organised workplaces may be more prone to experiencing psychosocial problems such as violence and bullying (Skogstad et al., 2011) as a response to stress and uncertainty caused by factors such as poor management, work overload and constant change (Hoad, 1993; Howard and Wech, 2012; Jones et al., 2011). This information will be useful in the development of countermeasures to prevent the occurrence of workplace violence.  Some 44% of respondents reported that in their organisation the management of workplace violence was a priority. This Ô¨Ånding is perhaps surprising given that the majority of respondents (75%) believed that their organisation was at low risk of violence. Possible explanations include the fact that a number of serious, high proÔ¨Åle, violence events have been reported within the New Zealand media in recent years, heightening the awareness of the violence risk and resulting in organisational concern and action to reduce violence risk. Equally, the prioritisation of violence prevention management among the sample may reÔ¨Çect the risk management strategy of prioritising low frequency, high hazard/impact events such as physical violence. The survey identiÔ¨Åed the violence control measures currently used by respondents‚Äô organisations. While an array of in- terventions were identiÔ¨Åed by respondents, just 50% of re- spondents‚Äô organisation formally recognised violence as a hazard in the workplace, while only 28% of organisations had a speciÔ¨Åc hazard management plan to address workplace violence risk e a concern given the 50% of organisations reporting violence cases during the 12 month period of the analysis. These Ô¨Åndings reÔ¨Çect those of international studies (Dillon, 2012) and suggest that violence management efforts may be out of step with the level of risk within organisations, particularly those within high-violence risk sectors. The Ô¨Åndings of this study suggest that organisations may often rely on single interventions, addressing just one aspect of risk and

With this research, we tested the comprehension of some existing healthcare graphical symbols in three different countries: the United States, South Korea, and Turkey. Testing the comprehension of the healthcare signs that are used in settings such as hospitals to aid wayÔ¨Ånding for patients and families is critical to signage development that is comprehensible to international users. Furthermore, testing those signs interna- tionally is necessary for developing standardized, universal signs. Developing universal signs will allow people from different cultural and linguistic backgrounds to easily Ô¨Ånd their way in hospitals and improve their experience in those settings. As the recent development and advancements in technology, communi- cation, and transportation have expedited globalization, global integration has brought the world closer.

The medical in- dustry has witnessed patients who travel to the opposite direction. In other words, less wealthy patients from developed countries traveling to seek affordable medical care (Herrick, 2007). The globalization in healthcare industry may cause confusion and miscommunication as patients and their families may experience difÔ¨Åculties from cultural differences. In the era of increased globalization, developing universal signs will make it easier for people traveling internationally to reach quality care in hospital settings. In addition to international patients, members of mi- nority populations who do not speak the major or the ofÔ¨Åcial language of that country and illiterate people would have difÔ¨Å- culty Ô¨Ånding their way in complex public environments such as hospitals. Signs are very helpful for wayÔ¨Ånding, and effective wayÔ¨Ånding systems are critical in unfamiliar environments. It is indicated in the existing body of literature that public information signs in healthcare facilities need standardization (Gakopoulos, 2009; Hablamos Juntos, 2003a, b; Rousek and Hallbeck, 2011). Thus, there is a need for international testing of those signs. This study focuses on healthcare symbol designs that may help patients who have different cultural and language backgrounds.

S. Lee et al.  / Applied Ergonomics 45 (2014) 878e885  879  provide a better facility user experience through easy navigation for global citizens.  1.1.  Signs and symbols  Many people visit healthcare settings in their times of stress and uncertainty while searching for healing. Lahood and Brink (2010) explained that ‚Äúlighting, color, Ô¨Ånish materials, furniture, and wayÔ¨Ånding are key design elements that deÔ¨Åne how comfort and aesthetics can play various roles in the overall hospital aesthetic‚Äù (p. 23). WayÔ¨Ånding can be deÔ¨Åned as spatial problem solving (Arthur and Passini, 1992). It requires intellectual abilities including decision making, decision executing, and information processing. Among many wayÔ¨Ånding aids, signage is considered to be a critical component to help in wayÔ¨Ånding. Sounds (words) and images (symbols) are two basic ways to communicate. While people can communicate complex ideas effectively with words, signs are used across language barriers (Wyman and Berger, 2005). Signs carry words, symbols, or both. Signs direct people to destinations to which they desire to go. Settings such as hospitals are visited by people of diverse backgrounds. Therefore, it is crucial that the signage is designed to be comprehended universally (Salmi, 2007). However, because signs are not interactive communication tools, people cannot ask questions when they do not understand them clearly. Thus, it is important that the messages on signs are easily understood without any further explanation and clariÔ¨Åcation (Carpman and Grant, 1993). People can navigate through hospital space easily when signs and pictograms are legible and can be clearly, quickly, and easily understandable (Gakopoulos, 2009). Kendler (2012) highlighted the role of abstraction in signage design, as it simpliÔ¨Åes the message and speeds up the cognitive process of comprehending the meaning by communicating the most important aspects of the referent. Simple, abstract line drawings are less distracting than a realistic representation of the referent. However, as Olmstead (1999) indicated, understanding the meaning of such abstract symbols depends on the viewer‚Äôs familiarity with culturally learned symbols. Cultural differences between the sender and receiver of signs can cause misinterpretation (Olmstead, 1999). Cowgill and Bolek (2003) suggested that a graphic symbol should utilize the essential facts about the referent, that the design of the sign should be uniform throughout the graphic and graphic system, that the symbols should be visually simple, that silhouette or side views should be preferred since they are easier to under- stand compared to frontal views, and that a symbol should be designed to be distinct from other signs to prevent confusion. Foster and Afzalnia (2005) also highlighted a lack of studies on signage comprehension that report international data. In their study, they found agreement on a single variant across three different countries, supporting the fact that international general principles can be applied to symbol standardization. However, they also found lower levels of comprehensibility in Iran compared to Korea and the U.K., signifying the importance of gathering cross- cultural data. Olmstead (1994) collected data in the U.S., Japan, and China to test 41 symbols for seven health-care referents. She found that Ô¨Åve symbols were estimated highly both in the U.S. and China, suggesting that universal symbols for healthcare facilities have potential to be understood in a cross-cultural fashion.  1.2.  International symbols for healthcare facilities  With the inÔ¨Çuence of increased interests in globalization, the use of symbols to communicate with people of different cultural and linguistic backgrounds has become more important in recent decades. Using pictograms would be helpful in countries with high illiteracy rates or with immigrant or minority populations who  cannot speak the major language of that country. In addition to communicating the referent to a diverse population of visitors, healthcare settings facilitate graphic symbols to avoid wayÔ¨Ånding problems that are due to the technical terms used on signs (Olmstead, 1999). Too often, medical and technical terms are not understood by patients and visitors (Carpman and Grant, 1993). Foster and Afzalnia (2005) noted that even though symbols are useful for communicating with people with different languages, the existence of many different symbols for any speciÔ¨Åc referent can be confusing. Public information signs for healthcare facilities have been used sporadically, and there has been a lack of research on their standardization (Olmstead, 1999). Pooaviah (reported in Gakopoulos, 2009) conducted a case study on signage systems in Ô¨Åve hospital settings in Bombay, India. India has 1600 dialects and 14 major languages, and the education level of the population varies (Gakopoulos, 2009). The numeric signage systems used in the hospitals at the time of the study caused difÔ¨Åculty in wayÔ¨Ånding, and people ended up waiting in the wrong line for a long period of time. Such confusions can be prevented by replacing the numerical signage system with pictogram-based signage. Healthcare signs should be intuitive, but their meanings still need to be explained to the public via distributing booklets to schools, organizations, and communities (Gakopoulos, 2009). Cowgill and Bolek (2003) also claimed that a symbol‚Äôs meaning can be taught or learned. Standards Australia tested the effectiveness of nine healthcare symbols, and results showed that respondents‚Äô comprehension increased by twelve percent for the second test (Cowgill and Bolek, 2003). However, Brugger (1999) claimed that symbols can be mis- interpreted across cultures. Foster and Afzalnia (2005) explained that the differences found in cross-cultural data would depend on the ‚Äúcultural speciÔ¨Åcity of the symbol or referent.‚Äù A form that has a speciÔ¨Åc meaning or association with a speciÔ¨Åc object or person ac- cording to a cultural group may not denote or connote the same meaning in another cultural group. According to Foster and Afzalnia (2005), it is difÔ¨Åcult to conclude whether or not a symbol interpre- tation can be culturally limited because it depends on the symbol. This study focused on some existing healthcare symbols and tested its comprehensibility in three different countries in order to Ô¨Ånd out if people who live in different countries understand healthcare symbols with the same level of comprehensibility.  2. Method  2.1.  Participants  This study employed the stratiÔ¨Åed sampling technique to select survey participants. The population was Ô¨Årst segmented into mutually exclusive sub-groups by age and gender. In the sample, there were three age groups: 18e30, 31e50, and over 50 years of age. In addition, there were two gender groups: male and female. Participants were recruited in three countries among natives of each country: U. S., South Korea, and Turkey. These three countries are considered to represent three distinct cultures including Western, Eastern, and Middle-Eastern. Each age group from each of the three countries included 20 respondents with 10 male and 10 female participants. A convenient sample of a total of 180 con- sumers participated in the study.  2.2.  Procedure  The oral consent of the participants was granted prior to their participation in the study, and the purpose of the study and experimental procedures were explained to each of them. Each respondent also completed a self-report sheet that was adapted  
880  S. Lee et al.  / Applied Ergonomics 45 (2014) 878e885  from the ISO‚Äôs comprehensibility test. The self-report sheet was used for collecting demographic data about the respondents‚Äô age, gender, education level, cultural background, and whether or not they had vision problems that would inÔ¨Çuence their responses to the pictograms. No participant reported that they had vision difÔ¨Å- culties that would impair their participation in the study. The data collection was conducted using a hard copy question- naire that included three sections: 1) the comprehension test, 2) the matching test, and 3) the judgment test. For each section, the respondents were told not to go back to their previous responses.  2.3. Measures and instruments  2.3.1.  The comprehension test  The Ô¨Årst section tested the comprehension of fourteen selected healthcare symbols (see Fig. 1) using the ISO comprehension test method. Those healthcare symbols were selected from a universal healthcare symbol set developed by Hablamos Juntos (http://www. hablamosjuntos.org/signage/PDF/Best%20Practices-FINALDec05. pdf), which is a project funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (http://www.hablamosjuntos.org/default.about.asp). The universal healthcare symbols were developed to help non- English speaking patients to navigate healthcare facilities in the U.S. Those 14 healthcare symbols showed basic information about some major departments in a healthcare setting including billing, cardiology, emergency, family practice, immunization, intensive care unit (ICU), laboratory, medical Ô¨Åles, ob clinic, pediatrics, pharmacy, radiology, surgery, and waiting area. An adjusted version of the ISO‚Äôs comprehension test was utilized to analyze the comprehensibility of the signs. The comprehension test allowed us to examine whether or not the respondents com- prehended what each of the fourteen symbols referred to. Each symbol was displayed on a single sheet. Each of the pictograms was placed in a 200  200 (50.8 mm  50.8 mm) square. The symbol was accompanied by a short description explaining that the symbol is used in healthcare settings. The respondents were asked about what they thought each symbol meant. Although the ISO‚Äôs comprehension test asks what action respondents think they should take after seeing a particular symbol, this questionnaire did not ask which action should be taken because it was irrelevant to the context of the symbol. Before starting the comprehension test, the respondents were shown an example test sheet with an example pictogram and its correct answer.  2.3.2.  The matching test  In the second section of the questionnaire, we showed the re- spondents the same fourteen pictograms that were used in the Ô¨Årst section. All of the fourteen pictograms were shown together on a single sheet and each of them had a size of 28 mm  28 mm. The  test provided a list of healthcare department names, including sixteen hospital services (pharmacy, emergency, intensive care unit, waiting area, immunization, billing, surgery, ob clinic, labo- ratory, pediatrics, radiology, medical Ô¨Åles, family practice, cardiol- ogy, orthopedics, internal medicine, and dermatology).  2.3.3.  The judgment test  This study tested emergency, cardiology, and pharmacy symbols (see Fig. 2) using the judgment test developed by the ISO (Inter- national Standards Organization, 9186:2001). The authors collected symbol examples that were being used in each country‚Äôs healthcare facilities. However, due to the limited uses of healthcare symbols, there were variants only from the U.S. and Korea for cardiology and pharmacy symbols. There were three variants for emergency symbols from the U.S., Korea and Turkey. The variants were printed for one referent on one single white sheet. The respondents were informed in words what each symbol was supposed to mean (i.e. emergency or cardiology) and that the symbol was intended to communicate its meaning to the general population in a healthcare setting. Respondents judged how much each symbol was under- standable by writing the percentage of the general population that the respondent expected would understand the meaning. Re- spondents were informed that the percentages they would write on all lines did not have to add up to 100.  2.4.  Research analysis  In order to examine how country, age, and gender are related to the comprehension of universal symbols, various statistical ana- lyses were employed to analyze the data. All calculations were made using SPSS 20. For the comprehension test, Pearson‚Äôs chi- square tests were conducted to examine universal healthcare symbol comprehension for cross-country, cross-age, and cross- gender comparisons. In addition, logistic regression was conduct- ed to predict the healthcare symbol comprehension outcomes with predictor variables of country and age. For the matching test, cross- country tabulations of successes in universal healthcare symbol matching in percentages were developed to explore differences in matching cross-country. To compare cross-country matching suc- cess statistically, Pearson‚Äôs chi-square tests were conducted for the same data. For the judgment tests, ANOVA was conducted for each symbol variant to compare cross-country.  3. Results  3.1.  The comprehension test  ISO 3864 (1984) determined 67% as the criteria for compre- hension of a graphical symbol. Many authors (e.g. Cowgill and  Fig. 1. Healthcare symbols used in the comprehension and the matching tests.  
S. Lee et al.  / Applied Ergonomics 45 (2014) 878e885  881  Fig. 2. Healthcare symbols used in the judgment test.  Bolek, 2003; Rousek and Hallbeck, 2011; Wolff and Wogalter, 1998) used 67% criteria in their studies. Cross tabulation of the compre- hension percentage in different countries was developed and shown in Table 1. Symbols that yielded 67% or more of the correct answers in all three countries were billing, emergency, laboratory, ob clinic, radiology, and surgery. The symbols that received less than 67% correct response rate in each country were as following: cardiology, family practice, immunizations, medical records, ICU, pediatrics, pharmacy, and waiting area in Korea; pediatrics, phar- macy, and waiting area in Turkey; cardiology and ICU in the US. While the ICU symbol showed a low comprehension percentage in all three countries, the cardiology, immunization, and pharmacy symbols were comprehended very differently depending on the country. Cross tabulations with Chi-square tests in Table 2 show the re- lationships between healthcare symbol comprehension and coun- tries. The test results showed that ten symbols (cardiology, emergency, family practice, immunization, laboratory, medical re- cords, pediatrics, pharmacy, surgery, and waiting area) have sig- niÔ¨Åcant relationships with countries. The associations of countries with symbol comprehensions were of moderate to strong strength in some symbols: the country that the participant lived in accounted for 37% of the variance in the score on comprehension of the immunization symbol, 45% of the variance in the score on comprehension of the family practice symbol, and 50% of the variance in the score on comprehension of the pharmacy symbol. While people in the U.S. and Turkey comprehended the immuni- zation and family practice symbols relatively easily, people in Korea had difÔ¨Åculty understanding it correctly. For the pharmacy symbol, only people in the U. S. understood the symbol easily. The waiting area symbol was identiÔ¨Åed correctly by a large majority of American respondents (82%), demonstrating a signiÔ¨Å- cant association between the country and symbol comprehension. The medical records symbol showed lower comprehension rates (53%) in Korea compared to the other two countries. The cardiology symbol showed very low comprehension percentages in the U. S. (35%) and Korea (43%), whereas it received a higher comprehension rate in Turkey (77%), again showing a signiÔ¨Åcant association be- tween nationality and its comprehension. Finally, comprehension rates of billing, ob clinic, and radiology did not show any signiÔ¨Åcant difference across nationality (all of those three symbols were identiÔ¨Åed by the respondents in all three countries with high percentages). Pearson‚Äôs Chi-square tests (2  2) and Fisher‚Äôs Exact Tests were conducted to examine the relationship between healthcare symbol comprehension and gender (Table 3), and no statistically signiÔ¨Åcant relationship were found both in total and in any country speciÔ¨Åc data. Pearson‚Äôs Chi-square tests (2  2) were conducted to examine the relationship between healthcare symbol comprehension and age (Table 4). The two younger aged groups ranging between 18 and 50 years were combined as they showed similarities in results and 2  2 Chi-square tests were conducted. Some statistically  signiÔ¨Åcant relationships were found between symbol comprehen- sion and the emergency, surgery, and waiting area symbols. The oldest age group (50 years of age or older) had more difÔ¨Åculty comprehending those symbols correctly compared to the younger age groups. Pearson‚Äôs Chi-square tests (2  2) and Fisher‚Äôs Exact tests were conducted to explore the relationship between symbol compre- hension and age in each country. No signiÔ¨Åcant relationship was found in the U.S. However, the younger age group showed better symbol comprehension compared to the older age group in Turkey and Korea. The signiÔ¨Åcant relationships between age and symbol comprehension in countries were found for the emergency, sur- gery, and waiting area signs in Turkey and Korea; and billing, medical records, and OB clinic signs in Korea only. Logistic regression analyses were performed with symbol comprehension as the dependent variable, and country, age, and a combined age and country term as predictor variables. A total of 180 cases were analyzed for each symbol, and the full model signiÔ¨Åcantly predicted correct symbol comprehension except for the cardiology, intensive care unit, and radiology symbols. Country was a reliable predictor variable for symbols including family practice (Exp(B) ¬º 5.56, p ¬º .0005), immunization (Exp(B) ¬º 5.60, p ¬º .0005), laboratory (Exp(B) ¬º 2.58, p ¬º .021), Ob (Exp(B) ¬º .405, p ¬º .015), pediatrics (Exp(B) ¬º 2.07, p ¬º .007), and pharmacy (Exp(B) ¬º 5.75, p ¬º .0005). According to the regression analyses results, the asso- ciations of country with symbol comprehensions were of weak to moderate strength; the country that the participant lived in accounted for 2% (billing) to 27% (pharmacy) of the variance in the score on matching of the symbols. While people in the U.S. and Turkey comprehended the immunization symbol relatively easily, people in Korea had difÔ¨Åculty understanding it correctly.  3.2.  The matching test  See Table 5 for the percentages of success in matching each healthcare symbol to its correct department title in each country. It displays high percentages of success rates in matching compared to the comprehension tests (except for the radiology symbol). The success rate percentages ranged from 82 to 100 with ex- ceptions of laboratory (68%) and pharmacy (45%) in Korea and pharmacy (47%) in Turkey. Although successfully identifying the pharmacy symbol increased by at least 20% in both Turkey and Korea, it was still lower than 50%. Cross tabulations with Chi-square tests in Table 6 show the relationships between healthcare symbol matching and countries. The test results indicated that matching the billing, cardiology, family practice, immunization, laboratory, and pharmacy symbols to their correct department titles has a signiÔ¨Åcant relationship with countries.  3.3.  The judgment test  The reported percentages were averaged for each of the groups that varied by age, gender, and nationality.  
Nationality inÔ¨Çuenced responses to all three of the emergency symbols and both of the pharmacy symbols signiÔ¨Åcantly. Koreans thought that, on average, 89% of the public in Korea would correctly identify the Korean emergency symbol. However, the average rat- ings dropped to 29% for the American emergency symbol and 1.3% for the Turkish emergency symbol. Surprisingly, Turks rated the American emergency symbol the highest (62%) followed by the Turkish (52%) and Korean (26%) emergency symbols. Americans rated the American emergency symbol the highest (95%) followed by the Korean (16%) and Turkish emergency (7%) symbols. None of those three emergency symbols received consistently high per- centages from all three countries. The radiology symbols did not signiÔ¨Åcantly receive different percentage ratings from Americans, Turks, and Koreans. The American radiology symbol received higher than an 80% rating from each country. None of the pharmacy symbols consistently received high percentages across all three countries. All of the three symbols that are used in the U.S. received higher than 80% ratings from the American respondents. Koreans rated the emergency and pharmacy signs that are used in Korea higher than 80%. Among all seven signs used in the test, the only sign that is used in Turkey is the Turkish emergency symbol, which did not receive average ratings higher than 55% from any of the three groups of respondents. A one-way between-subjects ANOVA test results revealed a statistically signiÔ¨Åcant effect of nationality on all emergency and pharmacy symbols. See Table 7 for effect sizes.  4. Discussion  Although the universal healthcare symbols were initially developed for individuals with various cultural backgrounds, this study found that some universal healthcare symbols were com- prehended with variances depending on the country in which the respondent resided. The comprehension test and cross-tabulations of its results demonstrated that Americans comprehended uni- versal healthcare symbols that were used in this study better than Turks and Koreans did. Those symbols were developed by an American institution, which might have inÔ¨Çuenced the results.  Therefore, the country individuals reside in may affect the comprehensibility of healthcare symbols. In the comprehension test, the billing, ob clinic, radiology, emergency, laboratory, and surgery symbols were identiÔ¨Åed correctly by at least 70% of the respondents in each of the three countries. Neither logistic regression nor Pearson‚Äôs Chi-square tests found any signiÔ¨Åcant differences between nationality and the comprehension of the Ô¨Årst three of those symbols (billing, ob clinic, and radiology). These results suggest that universal healthcare symbols can be under- stood cross-culturally, supporting Olmstead‚Äôs (1999) Ô¨Åndings. Results from logistic regression of the comprehension test showed that the country in which a respondent lives can be a factor that inÔ¨Çuences comprehension of a healthcare symbol such as pharmacy, immunization, and family medicine. The pharmacy symbol (a bottle-shaped pill container) used in this study is widely used in the U. S., and many of the American respondents were familiar with it. The symbol was rarely comprehended among the respondents in Turkey and Korea, because those countries use different types of medicine containers. In Turkey, the ofÔ¨Åcial sign for pharmacy includes the letter ‚Äúe‚Äù in a square frame, which is the initial for the word pharmacy in Turkish (eczane). This sign is required to be used at all pharmacy shops in Turkey, making the Turkish respondents unfamiliar with any other pharmacy signs. Some Turkish respondents confused the pharmacy symbol with the radiology symbol since R in the pharmacy symbol was confused with the R in radiology. Korean people had a difÔ¨Åcult time under- standing what the immunization symbol meant, because in Korea, injection is popularly practiced in family medicine and pediatrics; there is no need to identify the symbol. At usual visits to the hos- pital, Koreans may receive injections of various medicines. Also, there is an injection room next to the exam room in most doctors‚Äô ofÔ¨Åces such as pediatrics and internal medicine. Thus, Koreans did not think the injection shape meant an immunization sign. The family medicine symbol was another example that Korean re- spondents had difÔ¨Åculty identifying correctly. Many Korean re- spondents thought it was a consulting room or information desk where various types of visitors gather. In comparison to Koreans, Turkish respondents comprehended the family medicine symbol correctly. This is probably due to the recent policies in the Turkish  Table 1 Cross tabulations of universal healthcare symbol comprehension (unit: % of correct responses reported).

health industry which promote family medicine through cam- paigns and regulations. The pediatrics symbol was not compre- hended easily by the Korean and Turkish respondents. Many participants answered that it was an animal clinic, and some re- spondents associated the symbol with non-medical environments such as a children‚Äôs playground. According to the Pearson Chi- Square tests, cardiology, emergency, laboratory, medical records, surgery, and waiting room are other signs that were found to be associated with nationality. The cardiology symbol was not iden- tiÔ¨Åed correctly by the majority of the respondents in the U. S. and Korea. However, a majority of the Turkish respondents identiÔ¨Åed the symbol correctly as cardiology. Many American and Korean respondents identiÔ¨Åed the cardiology symbol as heart monitor, EKG, or deÔ¨Åbrillator. They may have thought that it meant a place where they could use those equipments. The emergency symbol that was used for the comprehension test was identiÔ¨Åed correctly by the majority of the respondents in all three countries. This symbol had the second highest average percentage of comprehension after the radiology symbol. The emergency symbol is widely used in American movies and shows, which have an international audience. The symbol includes ‚Äúemergency‚Äù in text form, making it easier to identify the sign for those who know English. However, despite high percentages of  comprehension of this symbol in all three countries, the Pearson‚Äôs Chi-square test results indicated that there is a signiÔ¨Åcant rela- tionship between nationality and the responses to this symbol. There is a 15% difference between the highest and the lowest per- centages of comprehension for this symbol between the rates of correct responses from the U.S. and Turkey. As it was expected that this symbol would be known by many Americans, the Turkish and Korean respondents‚Äô lesser familiarity with American media and lesser knowledge of English may have caused the difference. The ‚Äúmedical records‚Äù symbol received very different rates of correct responses from the three groups of respondents. The symbol was identiÔ¨Åed correctly by the majority of the respondents in the U.S. (87%) and Turkey (70%) and by about half of the Korean respondents (53%). Some of the Turkish respondents identiÔ¨Åed the symbol as a room or cabinet where medical supplies or equipment are stored. Medicine storage and pharmacy were some of the alternative responses that Korean respondents provided for the medical records symbol. The variety of responses to this symbol from the three countries exempliÔ¨Åes how cultural background or nationality inÔ¨Çuences perception of a symbol. In Turkey, patients usually do not interact with medical staff through their own medical records. On the contrary, American patients can ask for a copy of their records for employment reasons or for their own  Table 6 Cross-country comparisons with chi-square tests for universal healthcare symbol matching (c2 (4, N ¬º 180)).

Surgery and its comprehension had a signiÔ¨Åcant relationship with nationality despite being identiÔ¨Åed correctly by the majority of the respondents in all three countries. The symbol was inter- preted by some Korean respondents as a doctor‚Äôs ofÔ¨Åce, patient‚Äôs room, or examination room. Some Turkish respondents identiÔ¨Åed the symbol as patient care instead of surgery. Finally, waiting room was identiÔ¨Åed correctly by a high percentage of American re- spondents (82%). However, less than 65% of Korean and Turkish respondents identiÔ¨Åed it as waiting room. Both Turkish and Korean respondents identiÔ¨Åed the symbol as a reading or rest area. Those results support Brugger‚Äôs (1999) statement that symbols can be misunderstood across cultures. While gender did not show any signiÔ¨Åcant association with symbol comprehension in the comprehension test, age did have a signiÔ¨Åcant association with healthcare symbols including emer- gency, surgery, and waiting room. The emergency symbol includes an English word that most older people in Korea and Turkey would not be able to read because English has become more popular around the world in the recent decades as a result of increased globalization and the media effect. Thus, the younger generations are more likely to have learned English at a school age compared to the older generations. Regarding the surgery symbol, many older people in Turkey and Korea misunderstood it as a patient room. For the waiting room symbol, some older respondents in Turkey and Korea answered that it was a reading room, as the symbol shows a person who is reading. Based on statistical analyses of Chi-square tests in the compre- hension and matching tests and logistic regression of the comprehension tests, there were commonly shared results. The country in which a respondent resides is associated with the cor- rect comprehension of healthcare symbols, including family prac- tice, immunization, laboratory, and pharmacy. These results provide important information for designers: symbol design should consider cultural diversity so that symbols can be comprehended universally. It also shows that it is a great challenge for designers to devise universal symbols which can be understood accurately by people of various cultural backgrounds. Results from the judgment test revealed that people compre- hended symbol design from their own country signiÔ¨Åcantly better. These results support the Ô¨Åndings of comprehension and matching tests. In addition, previous studies indicated that the judgment test predicted the comprehension test results (Brugger, 1999; Foster and Afzalnia (2005); Young and Wogalter, 2001). The matching test results support that familiarity inÔ¨Çuences understanding of a symbol. Promoting simple and easily identiÔ¨Åable universal healthcare symbols in different countries and making the public familiar with them can increase their comprehensibility. The matching test results also support Gakopoulos (2009) and Cogwill and Bolek‚Äôs (2003) suggestions that symbols can be learned and should be explained to the public. A lack of familiarity with most of the symbols that are included in this study may have inÔ¨Çuenced the results. For example, the emergency symbol is widely used on ambulances, creating famil- iarity for many Americans, which would explain why 98% of Americans understood it. However, 100% of the American re- spondents understood the radiology symbol correctly, although it is not used commonly in the country. This indicates that, although familiarity inÔ¨Çuences the comprehensibility of healthcare symbols, clear and effective symbol design can be understood by users easily regardless of their familiarity with the symbol. The respondents‚Äô varying familiarity with healthcare departments and services is another limitation of this study. The older generation might be more familiar with particular hospital services compared to the  younger generation. For more comprehensive results, data should be collected from more countries and from larger samples. With this study, we aim to contribute to the development of universal healthcare symbols to improve the experiences of healthcare facility visitors from different cultural and linguistic backgrounds. The results indicate that it is possible to develop universal symbols that can be used in different countries, and there is a need to develop and test universal healthcare signs. Some of the signs that were used in this study were identiÔ¨Åed correctly by the majority of the respondents from all three coun- tries, supporting the possibility of cross-cultural comprehensibility of healthcare symbols. However, many symbols did poorly in one or two of the three countries, revealing a need for designing better symbols that would address people with different nationalities and cultural backgrounds. As mentioned by Foster and Afzalnia (2005), meanings of symbols can be interpreted differently in different cultures, and it is difÔ¨Åcult to conclude that a symbol‚Äôs comprehension depends on the symbol itself. Designers need to pay more attention to the cultural limitations of symbol inter- pretation. It is critical to develop healthcare symbols that can be comprehended universally as symbols, such as emergency, which can directly impact people‚Äôs lives and health. This study suggests that universal healthcare symbols should be tested in different countries to make sure they can be comprehended across countries.  5.  Conclusion  Comprehension test results revealed that some signs can be comprehended in all three countries with high percentages. However, testing of some other signs revealed signiÔ¨Åcant differ- ences of sign comprehension across the three countries. The matching test results indicated that familiarity may increase the comprehension of signs. Explaining signs to the public or using the same standard signs over time can increase their comprehensibility by the healthcare setting visitors. Although gender did not have a signiÔ¨Åcant inÔ¨Çuence on sign comprehension, age had a signiÔ¨Åcant relationship with correctly identifying some of the signs. Further research is necessary to understand the relationship between age and sign comprehension. The judgment test results revealed that there is signiÔ¨Åcant relationship between predicting signs correctly and nationality. Such results support that it is possible to develop universal healthcare signs that can be understood by people of different cultural and linguistic backgrounds. The results also support that some symbols can be interpreted very differently in different cultures. Thus, it is necessary to test symbols across countries in their development process. It is possible to develop and test universal symbols that can be used in different countries; however, designers should consider cultural limitations of sign interpretation in their design process.

s0003687013002305,"  Every day people read text presented on different displays, such as books, newspapers, signs, computer screens, navigation moni- tors, instrument panels, etc., often not perpendicularly but at a display angle. The angle between the display normal and the sightline of the observer is called incident angle, which has a possible range from 0 to 90 . People prefer to read text presented horizontally from left to right at an incident angle of zero or close to zero, as of a normal reading habit to which people get used. People‚Äôs reading performance may be affected if text is presented in a different way, e.g., on rotated and/or tilted displays. It was found that reading is slower for vertical text due to a decrease in the size of the visual span (the number of letters recognized without moving the eyes) for vertical reading (Byrne, 2002; Yu et al., 2010; Legge et al., 2007). Although the legibility of an individual letter is not affected by the visual span, it is affected by the orientation and the perspective view of the text changed with the display angles from horizontal left to right (at 0 ) to some oblique directions (Cai, 2008). Nonetheless, oblique viewing of displays is unavoidable in daily life. Extremely large display angle close to 90 is also possible, e.g., when a driver reads road pavement markings at a far distance, when a customer in a shopping mall walks around Ô¨Åxed advertising boards, when a police ofÔ¨Åcer tries to spot the plate of a moving vehicle on the opposite side of the street, or when a pharmacist  * Corresponding author.

In addition, the display angle often varies over time and space when moving observers read a Ô¨Åxed sign (e.g., a driver spots a roadway sign), or when seated or standing still observers read a moving or rotating display (e.g., observing a street parade). Since Erdmann and Dodge (1898), numerous researchers in human factors and related Ô¨Åelds studied the legibility of Roman characters. In the majority of those studies, the viewing materials were read perpendicularly to the sightline of the observers (i.e., display angle ¬º 0 ). Only a few researchers looked into the common oblique viewing of text, including Snyder and Maddox (1978), Reinwald (n.d.), and Payne (1983). In addition, those studies focused on the target size (e.g. character height H, width W, or strokewidth Sw) and viewing distance D, but rarely took other critical factors of legibility into account, including (a) age Ag of observers; (b) visual acuity Ac of observers; (c) viewing angles (e.g., horizontal viewing angle 4, vertical viewing angle a, or incident angle x); (d) visual angle subtense V of characters (V ¬º arctan (H/ D)); (e) font; (f) target luminance Lt, background luminance Lb, or surrounding luminance Ls; (g) luminance contrast C or C%; and (h) color contrast DE (Cai et al., 2013). Some quantitative studies developed equations for quantifying the legibility of characters. Cai (2008) collected 96 legibility equa- tions (http://people.ku.edu/wh717c996/research.html). Among them, Howett (1983) derived an equation, as Equation (1), for estimating the legibility of text (i.e., letters AeZ) viewed perpen- dicularly. Equation (1) examines Ô¨Åve critical factors (text height or strokewidth, viewing distance, background luminance, luminance  0003-6870/$ e see front matter √ì 2013 Elsevier Ltd and The Ergonomics Society.

Equation (2) was theoretically derived from the minimum angle of resolution (MAR, in minutes of arc, or min arc), which speciÔ¨Åes the visual acuity of human eyes, via the geometric relationship between the MAR and the viewing distance D (Holick and Carlson, 2002; Colomb et al., 1991; Cai, 2008). Equation (2) calculates the threshold legible (100% accu- rate) strokewidth of sans-serif 5  5 (i.e., being framed tangentially by a square, 5 unit lengths in height and width) capitalized letters C, D, E, F, H, K, N, P, R, U, V, and Z used for making eye charts that are viewed perpendicularly to the observer‚Äôs eyes. The MAR has different values for different eyesight levels (e.g., MAR ¬º 0.63 min arc for Snellen eyesight 20/12.5, 0.8 for 20/16, 1 for 20/20, 1.25 for 20/25, 1.6 for 20/30, 2.0 for 20/40, 2.5 for 20/50, and 3.2 for 20/60, etc.). Equation (3) was derived from Equation (2) in that the height- to-strokewidth ration (H/Sw) of those capitalized letters C, D, E, F, H, K, N, P, R, U, V, and Z is 5. Equations (2) and (3) do not include any lighting related critical factors. Instead, they assume an optimal uniform (variation  20%) lighting conditionda background luminance of at least 120 cd/m2drequired for reading eye charts by the British standard BS 4274-1:2003 (BSI, 2003). Therefore, Equa- tion (1) is more useful in practice than Equations (2) and (3) for estimating legibility of text under varying lighting conditions.

Since 4 and a are both needed to deÔ¨Åne the incident angle x  (  √∞cos x ¬º cos 4 cos a√û, Reinwald‚Äôs formula cannot examine all display angles.

Some equation forms, such as linear, quadratic, or cubic, were chosen by those researchers to best Ô¨Åt the legibility data, without a thorough examination of the physical and psychophysical fundaments behind their research. Nonetheless, it is expected that unitary forms be adopted by equations developed in different visual situations but with the same dependent variable (DV) and independent variables (IV). Moreover, there lacked an index for evaluating the legibility level of text and graphics presented on oblique displays in those old studies. The conventional Legibility Index, LI (LI ¬º D/H), deÔ¨Åned as the distance D at which material can be read with perfect accuracy divided by the character height H, assumes that the viewing ma- terial is perpendicular to the observer. The D/H ratio cannot be used for evaluating characters viewed at display angles. Cai et al. (2013) recently conducted a study on legibility of text presented on oblique displays. Cai et al. used nine assumptions to narrow the research scope to achromous letter ‚ÄòE‚Äôs presented on diffusive displays under uniform glare-free Ô¨Çuorescent lighting, and read at threshold (just readable) 100% accuracy by young people at 20e29 years of age with Snellen acuity ratio 20/20 or better and normal color vision. Cai‚Äôs study came out with several results, as follows.   A new legibility index (LI0 ), as Equation (5), to evaluate text and graphics viewed at different display angles (Cai and Green, 2009).

They limit the ap- plications of the new legibility index LI0 (Equation (5)) and the new legibility equation (Equation (7)), as detailed below.  r  Ô¨ÉÔ¨ÉÔ¨ÉÔ¨É  1  u  0 ¬º  LI   Cai‚Äôs study (Cai et al., 2013) did not examine the extremely large 82.8e90.0 , which display angles actually occur in daily viewing. To create and maintain legible environments, it is necessary to quantify the legibility of text viewed at all possible display angles 0.0e90.0 .  The assumptions used in Cai‚Äôs study (Cai et al., 2013) make Equation (7) inapplicable for multiple realistic letters. As a result, Cai recommended deploying the capital letter E (C% ¬º 97.9, black/white, H/W ¬º 1, H/Sw ¬º 5) as a reference target in practice, to estimate legible sizes of texts, calculate ideal viewing distances or ideal viewing angles of multiple displays, and design threshold lighting conditions with enhanced legi- bility (Cai et al., 2013). Future studies will need to examine more realistic letters, such as those Sans-serif capitalized letters C, D, E, F, H, K, N, P, R, U, V, and Z, which are commonly used for legibility and visual acuity tests.  The redeÔ¨Åned legibility index LI0 (LI0 ¬º u 0.5) does not take the impact of people‚Äôs normal reading habit on reading oblique the LI0 value of equally materials into account, which lowers legible characters viewed at extremely large display angles.

Hobserved is the height of the threshold legible (just readable 100% accurate) achromous letter E observed at different display angles. Hpredicted is the predicted height of the letter E at different display angles using the new index LI0 (Equation (5)), so that the letter E has a constant legibility level independent of display angles. As shown in Equation (6), the mean 1.00 for incident angle 0  x  65.2 .

Equation (6) reveals that people‚Äôs normal reading habit starts to play a role at large display angles, which lowers their reading performance that could no longer be negligent starting at the critical angle of 65.7 (Cai, 2008).

This paper introduces a follow-up laboratory study on quantifying the impact of display angles 0.0e90.0 on the legibility of sans-serif 5  5 capitalized letters C, D, E, F, H, K, N, P, R, U, V, and Z commonly used for visual acuity tests.

Method  3.1.  Experiment setup  The laboratory experiment was conducted in the windowless Bob Foley Illumination Laboratory in 232 Art & Design building at the University of Kansas (KU). Fig. 2 illustrates the experiment  setup. As shown in Fig. 2(a)e(c), a participant sat on an adjustable chair at one end of the laboratory with his/her head Ô¨Åxed on a chin rest mounted on a table. The human subjects were required to be 20e29 years old, with Snellen acuity ratio 20/20 or better (i.e., 20/ 20, 20/16, 20/12.5, either corrected or not), and normal color vision. A dimmable LED light panel was mounted on a custom-made wood shelf installed on a table in the front of the laboratory. The shelf, together with the LED panel, could be horizontally rotated (0  4  90 ) and vertically tilted (0  a  90 ) around the center O of the bottom edge of the LED panel. As shown in Fig. 2(b), the most uniform luminous surface (max/min luminance ratio ¬º 1.10) of the LED panel was identiÔ¨Åed at its center in a rectangular area of 0.216 m  0.140 m (8.500  5.500 ). A black foam board was used to a 0.216 m  0.140 m hole was cut to provide uniform and dimmable cover the entire LED panel except this small rectangular area, where backlight for the small display window.

H. Cai, L. Li  / Applied Ergonomics 45 (2014) 865e877  869  materials were presented on this display window and viewed by the participant at different display angles. Initially, the LED panel was facing the participant at an incident angle of 0 , as shown in Fig. 2(a). The distance from the participant‚Äôs eyes to the center of the 0.216 m  0.140 m display window was 3 m (9.8 ft). The participant‚Äôs eyes were Ô¨Åxed at 1.2 m above the Ô¨Çoor, same as the height of the center of the display window. However, as shown in Fig. 2(b), when the LED panel was rotated and tilted around the rotation center O, the viewing distance would slightly change, since O did not overlap with the center of the 0.216 m  0.140 m display window. The adjusted viewing distance D0 was calculated using Equation (8). Due to the same reason, the incident angle x could no longer be calculated using cos x ¬º cos 4 cos a. Rather, Equation (9) was used. Nonetheless, Equations (8) and (9) are not recom- mended for practical uses where displays are rotated and tilted at the center of the display window.  s  Ô¨ÉÔ¨ÉÔ¨ÉÔ¨ÉÔ¨ÉÔ¨ÉÔ¨ÉÔ¨ÉÔ¨ÉÔ¨ÉÔ¨ÉÔ¨ÉÔ¨ÉÔ¨ÉÔ¨ÉÔ¨ÉÔ¨ÉÔ¨ÉÔ¨ÉÔ¨ÉÔ¨ÉÔ¨ÉÔ¨ÉÔ¨ÉÔ¨ÉÔ¨ÉÔ¨ÉÔ¨ÉÔ¨ÉÔ¨ÉÔ¨ÉÔ¨ÉÔ¨ÉÔ¨ÉÔ¨ÉÔ¨ÉÔ¨ÉÔ¨ÉÔ¨ÉÔ¨ÉÔ¨ÉÔ¨ÉÔ¨ÉÔ¨ÉÔ¨ÉÔ¨ÉÔ¨ÉÔ¨ÉÔ¨ÉÔ¨ÉÔ¨ÉÔ¨ÉÔ¨ÉÔ¨ÉÔ¨ÉÔ¨ÉÔ¨ÉÔ¨ÉÔ¨ÉÔ¨ÉÔ¨ÉÔ¨ÉÔ¨ÉÔ¨ÉÔ¨ÉÔ¨ÉÔ¨ÉÔ¨ÉÔ¨ÉÔ¨ÉÔ¨ÉÔ¨ÉÔ¨ÉÔ¨ÉÔ¨ÉÔ¨ÉÔ¨ÉÔ¨ÉÔ¨ÉÔ¨ÉÔ¨ÉÔ¨ÉÔ¨ÉÔ¨ÉÔ¨ÉÔ¨ÉÔ¨ÉÔ¨ÉÔ¨ÉÔ¨ÉÔ¨ÉÔ¨ÉÔ¨ÉÔ¨ÉÔ¨ÉÔ¨ÉÔ¨ÉÔ¨ÉÔ¨ÉÔ¨ÉÔ¨ÉÔ¨ÉÔ¨ÉÔ¨ÉÔ¨ÉÔ¨ÉÔ¨ÉÔ¨ÉÔ¨ÉÔ¨ÉÔ¨É    2  2 √æ  2√æ  0 ¬º  D  h  2  sinasin4  D√æh  2  sinacos4  √∞1 cosa√û  h  2  2 64  x ¬º arccos  3 q Ô¨ÉÔ¨ÉÔ¨ÉÔ¨ÉÔ¨ÉÔ¨ÉÔ¨ÉÔ¨ÉÔ¨ÉÔ¨ÉÔ¨ÉÔ¨ÉÔ¨ÉÔ¨ÉÔ¨ÉÔ¨ÉÔ¨ÉÔ¨ÉÔ¨ÉÔ¨ÉÔ¨ÉÔ¨ÉÔ¨ÉÔ¨ÉÔ¨ÉÔ¨ÉÔ¨ÉÔ¨ÉÔ¨ÉÔ¨ÉÔ¨ÉÔ¨ÉÔ¨ÉÔ¨ÉÔ¨ÉÔ¨ÉÔ¨ÉÔ¨ÉÔ¨ÉÔ¨ÉÔ¨ÉÔ¨ÉÔ¨ÉÔ¨ÉÔ¨ÉÔ¨ÉÔ¨ÉÔ¨ÉÔ¨ÉÔ¨ÉÔ¨ÉÔ¨ÉÔ¨ÉÔ¨ÉÔ¨ÉÔ¨ÉÔ¨ÉÔ¨ÉÔ¨ÉÔ¨ÉÔ¨ÉÔ¨ÉÔ¨ÉÔ¨ÉÔ¨ÉÔ¨ÉÔ¨ÉÔ¨ÉÔ¨ÉÔ¨ÉÔ¨ÉÔ¨ÉÔ¨É 75  2 sin a √æ D cos a cos 4 √æ D2 √æ Dh sin a cos 4   h2 2 cos a  h2  2  h  (8)  (9)  Such a displacement of the rotation center O from the center of the display window to the center of the bottom edge of the LED panel is necessary to accommodate the extremely oblique viewing angles of the display. In the previous study (Cai, 2008), Cai adopted an alter- native design with two supporting arms of the wood shelf to tilt and rotate the display around its center. These two supporting arms un- fortunately blocked the display window at incident angles larger than 82.8 , which was the maximum angle examined in the laboratory. In this new experiment, therefore, the supporting arms were removed to accommodate the extremely oblique angles larger than 82.8 . The experiment was conducted in two sessions at different ambient light levels. At Session I, the general light of the laboratory was turned on, as shown in Fig. 2(c), with an average surrounding luminance Ls ¬º 6.89 cd/m2, measured using the high dynamic range (HDR) photography (Cai and Chung, 2011). At Session II, the general light was turned off, as shown in Fig. 2(d), Ls ¬º 0.04 cd/m2. The purpose of testing different ambient light levels in this experiment was to Ô¨Ånd the impact of ambient light on the text legibility at extremely large display angles close to 90 , which has not yet been investigated in Cai‚Äôs previous studies (Cai et al., 2013; Cai, 2008). sans-serif 5  5 capitalized letters C, D, E, F, H, K, N, P, R, U, V, and Z. The viewing materials used in this experiment consisted of the Their mixed uses are recommended by the British Standard BS 4274-1:2003 (BSI, 2003) for testing visual acuity of human eyes. The choice of these letters was based on two reasons, as follows:   Based on a previous study (Cai and Green, 2009, Fig. 9), those 5  5 Sans-Serif capitalized letters C (index of legibility difÔ¨Åculty ¬º 1.07), D (1.03), E (1.00), F (1.04), H (0.92), K (1.05), N (1.00), P (1.04), R (0.97), U (1.07), V (1.03), and Z (1.01) have (p ¬º 0.15) values of statistically equivalent the legibility difÔ¨Å- culty index.  In addition, those upright capitalized letters are capable of being framed tangentially by a square, 5 unit lengths in height and width (British Standard BS 4274-1:2003). Therefore, they are appropriate for testing legibility loss at extremely large viewing angles close to 90 , no matter how they are vertically tilted or horizontally rotated or both simultaneously in the experiment.  The height of those sans-serif letters, which are threshold legible (100% accurate) to the observer, was predictable using Equation (10), from the minimum angle of resolution (MAR) of the observer‚Äôs eyes, the display angle x (calculated using Equation (9)), and the adjusted viewing distance D0 (calculated using Equation (8)). MAR equals 1 min arc for human subjects with eyesight 20/20, 0.8 min arc for 20/16, and 0.63 min arc for 20/12.5 (BSI, 2003).  H ¬º 0:00145$MAR$D 0 $√∞cos x√û 0:5  (10)  Nonetheless, the actual height (Hobserved) of those legible letters observed by each participant in the laboratory might differ from the predicted height (Hpredicted), due to individual differences in visual perception. To accommodate this uncertainty, each viewing mate- rial consisted of multiple (mostly 10) lines of those sans-serif let- ters. Between lines there was a graduation of height at a step of Hpredicted/5dthe strokewidth Sw of the threshold legible (100% ac- curacy) letters. The Hpredicted was assigned to the third to the last line on each viewing material. Materials were printed in black/ white (C% ¬º 92.4  0.6) on transparencies in a resolution of 600 DPI, which were attached on the uniform display window of the LED panel. The height of each line was labeled on the right margin of the material in font 7 (2.5 mm), which was out of the display window (no backlight), thus, illegible to the participant. A unique viewing material was designed for each display angle tested in the laboratory at each eyesight level (i.e., 20/20, 20/16, or 20/12.5) of the human subjects. As a result, the number of viewing materials tested by each participant was determined by the number of display angles tested in the laboratory. For example, Fig. 3 shows three materials viewed by the same participant at three different incident angles (x ¬º 0.0 , 45.0 , 65.8 ). Regarding the independent and dependent variables, one dependent variable (DV) and two independent variables (IV) were examined in the laboratory. The DV was the recognized height (Hob- served) of the threshold legible (just readable 100% accurate) letters at each trial. The IV includes the display angle x and the surrounding luminance Ls (Ls ¬º 6.89 cd/m2 when the general light was on, and 0.04 cd/m2 when the it was turned off.). The solid angle subtense (u) of the observed threshold legible letters at different display angles could be derived using u ¬º W $H$cos x=√∞D0 √û2 . Note that for those sans-serif 5  5 capitalized letters, the width (W) equals the height (H). All other factors involved in the experiment had preset values. For example, the font type (sans-serif 5  5 capitalized letters), the color contrast of those letters (black/white), the luminance contrast of those letters (C% ¬º 92.4  0.6), the background luminance of the viewing materials at different display angles (dimmed to a constant value about 280.0 cd/m2 in the direction of the participant‚Äôs sightline, independent of display angles), the recognition perfor- mance (threshold legible with 100% accuracy), the unique age (20e 29), eyesight (20/20 or better), and color vision (normal) of each individual subject, etc. The experiment procedure is listed below, step by step.   Before the subject came, the experimenter prepared the eyesight test and the Ô¨Årst trial of the experiment at Session I.

There was no time limitation. During the process, the experimenter took a photo- graph of the test scene with a remote using a Canon EOS Rebel T2i mounted behind the subject. Then, the experimenter recorded the height (Hobserved) of the last line of letters that the participant could read at a threshold performance of just read- able 100% accuracy, by referring to its mark on the right margin of the materials.  The subject was asked to turn around for a break when the experimenter set up the second trial. The background lumi- nance (Lb) of the small display window of the LED panel was the constant 280.0 cd/m2.

He/she might leave the laboratory for a stretch or using the restroom. Meanwhile, the experimenter turned off the general light to set up the Ô¨Årst trial at the second session. The surface luminance (Lb) of the display window was again dimmed to 280.0 cd/m2.  The participant sat in dark for at least 5 min to have his/her eyes fully adapted to the dark environment and then took the Ô¨Årst trial at Session 2.  This process repeated for all other trials at Session II. With the general light off, all trials at the second session were randomly conducted.  After the experiment was completed, the subject was paid for their participation at both sessions. All collected data were then stored for further analysis.  3.2.  Pilot run  A pilot run of the experiment using 10 young college students (20e29 years of age) was Ô¨Årst conducted to Ô¨Ånd the largest incident angle at which the materials could still be readable, and prepare for the main experiment. The so identiÔ¨Åed largest incident angle could help Ô¨Ånalize the setup of the main experiment. Those 10 subjects  were asked to read viewing materials presented on the display window of the LED panel at a total of 14 display angles (x ¬º 0.0 , 15.0 , 30.0 , 45.0 , 49.4 , 56.8 , 60.0 , 65.8 , 71.6 , 75.9 , 78.2 , 83.1, 85.2 , 89.0 ), as shown in Table 1. Fig. 4 shows the subjects‚Äô actual view of the viewing materials attached on the display win- dow at different incident angles. Note that 90 was not included in the pilot run since no materials could be read at 90 , instead, 89 window was dimmed to 280.8  1.0 cd/m2 was tested. During the experiment, the luminance Lb of the display at Session I, and 280.7  1.1 cd/m2 at Session II, independent of incident angles. Later it was found that at the largest incident angle 89.0 , all 10 subjects (100%) failed to read the materials at both sessions. Even the largest letters were not visible to them. At the second to the largest incident angle 85.2 , three subjects (30%) failed to read the materials at Session I, while two subjects (20%) failed to read the materials at Session II. At all other 12 display angles (x ¬º 0.0 , 15.0 , 30.0 , 45.0 , 49.4 , 56.8 , 60.0 , 65.8 , 71.6 , 75.9 , 78.2 , 83.1 ), no subject (0%) failed to read the materials at either session. As a result, the threshold incident angle x50%, where the viewing materials were readable by 50% of the young subjects, is 85.2 < x50% < 89.0 .

Results  x50%,  It was found that at the largest display angle 88.0 , 19 out of the 20 subjects (95%) failed to read even the largest letters of the viewing materials at both sessions in the main experiment. At the second to the largest display angle 87.0 , six subjects (30%) failed to read the materials at Session I, and Ô¨Åve subjects (25%) failed at Session II. At the third to the largest display angle 85.2 , two sub- jects (10%) failed to read the materials at Session I, and one subject (5%) failed at Session II. At all other smaller display angles (x ¬º 0.0 , 15.0 , 30.0 , 45.0 , 51.7, 56.8 , 60.0 , 65.8 , 71.6 , 75.9 , 79.4 , 83.1 ), no subject (0%) failed to read the materials at either session. Consequently, the threshold incident angle at which the viewing materials were barely readable by 50% of the subjects, was 87.0 < x50% < 88.0 . in a narrow range of Remember that 85.2 < x50% < 89.0 as identiÔ¨Åed in the pilot run. The largest display angle at which the materials were still readable with 100% accuracy was 83.1  xmax < 85.2 , which conÔ¨Årmed the Ô¨Åndings obtained from the pilot experiment. The recorded legible heights (Hobserved) of the materials viewed by the 20 young subjects in the main experiment were further analyzed versus the 15 incident angles (x ¬º 0.0 , 15.0 , 30.0 , 45.0 , 51.7, 56.8 , 60.0 , 65.8 , 71.6 , 75.9 , 79.4 , 83.1, 85.2 , 87.0 , 88.0 ) and the two ambient light levels (Ls ¬º 6.89 cd/m2 at Session I, and 0.04 cd/m2 at Session II). First, independent of different eyesight levels of the participants, Hobserved/Hpredicted was used to quantify the text legibility at different incident angles at each session in the main experiment. Hobserved is the observed threshold legible (just readable 100% accuracy) height of a sans-serif 5  5 capitalized letter. Hpredicted is the predicted height of the threshold legible letter at the third to the last line on each viewing material, using Equation (10). Fig. 6(a) and (b) illus- trates the error bar plots of the subjects‚Äô reading performance at Session I and II, respectively, which consists of 95% conÔ¨Ådence in- terval (CI) of the mean ratio of Hobserved/Hpredicted versus different display angles. As shown in Fig. 6, collected from the 20 subjects at both sessions gradually increases with the display angles.  the ratio of Hobserved/Hpredicted  Second, the ratios of Hobserved/Hpredicted obtained at both sessions were analyzed with SPSS, using a one-way ANOVA and Pearson correlation tests, for the impact of ambient light (Ls ¬º 6.89 cd/m2 at Session I, and 0.04 cd/m2 at Session II) on the subjects‚Äô reading performance. With the Pearson‚Äôs r ¬º 0.932, a partial correlation, controlled at each of the 15 display angles, was found between the ratios of Hobserved/Hpredicted obtained at session I with the general lighting and the ratios at session II without the general light. There was no signiÔ¨Åcant difference of the 20 subjects‚Äô reading perfor- mance between these two sessions, indicating a negligible impact of the ambient light on the text legibility. Since no signiÔ¨Åcant difference was found in the subjects‚Äô reading performance between sessions I and II, the legibility data obtained at both sessions were combined to plot in SPSS a more reliable trendline of the text legibility versus different incident angles. Fig. 7 illustrates the Loess curve that Ô¨Åts 50% of the points at a conÔ¨Ådent level of 95% at both sessions. The Loess curve shows that the ratio of Hobserved/Hpredicted is on a trendline of three segments. In the Ô¨Årst segment with the incident angles from 0.0 till probably 51.7, the trendline is almost a constant In the second segment of the trendline, from 51.7 to appropriately 71.6 , the ratio of Hobserved/Hpredicted gradually increases, non-linearly. In the third segment of the trendline, the ratio of Hobserved/Hpredicted from 71.6 till 88.0 rapidly increases (the largest display angle tested in the main experiment). Beyond 88.0 till 90.0 , the viewing materials were no long visible. A non-linear regression equation was then generated with SPSS to approximate the three segments of the trendline shown in Fig. 7. The ratios of Hobserved/Hpredicted obtained at both sessions were combined for generating this regression equation, since no signif- icant difference was found in the subjects‚Äô reading performance between sessions. In addition, during the regression process, the average offset of the mean Hobserved/Hpredicted from the line of the regression equation was calculated at display angles from 0.0 to 65.8 (before people‚Äôs normal reading habit starts to play a signif- icant role on the participants‚Äô reading performance at large oblique angles, see more details later), to justify the regression equation so that it best Ô¨Åts the observed data with the smallest offset. As a (R2 ¬º 0.859) was generated to Ô¨Åt result, Equation (11) the mean ratio of Hobserved/Hpredicted at different display angles 0.0e88.0 . With Equation (11), the average offset at those eight display angles  (Hobserved/Hpredicted ¬º 1.00).  Table 2 All variables tested or preset in the main experiment.

Fig. 8 illustrates the error bar plot of the 20 subjects‚Äô reading performance at both sessions I and II, and, for comparison, the curve of Equation (11).

Hobserved Hpredicted  ¬º 0:268√∞cos x√û 0:655 √æ 0:695  (11)  As shown in Fig. 8 and Table 3, the mean ratios of the recorded Hobserved/Hpredicted gradually increase at the Ô¨Årst eight display an- gles 0.0e65.8 . Yet the increase over this span of display angles is so small that even at 65.8 , the average Hobserved/Hpredicted (i.e., 1.18) is still less than 1.2. Since the minimum increase of letter height between lines on the viewing materials is Hpredicted/5, which is the strokewidth Sw of the threshold legible (100% accuracy) letters, the minimum increase of Hobserved/Hpredicted is 1/5 ¬º 0.2. Therefore, the Ô¨Çuctuations of the at the Ô¨Årst eight display angles (0  x  65.8 ) from a constant 1 are all less than the minimum increase of 0.2. Such a steady reading performance  average Hobserved/Hpredicted  (Hobserved/Hpredicted ¬º 1) of  the 20 participants recorded in the laboratory at both sessions means that the interfering effect of the normal reading habit is negligent at display angles 0  x  65.8 . Even without correction, the revised legibility index LI0 (LI0 ¬º u 0.5) could still be used to effectively evaluate legibility. However, at display angles above 65.8 , the calculated ratios of Hobserved/Hpredicted rapidly increase with a spike at 88.0 (the largest display angle tested in the laboratory, above which the viewing materials were no longer visible). Equation (11) is used to at display angles 65.8e88.0 . approximate this rapid increase Remember that the largest display angle at which the materials were still readable with 100% accuracy was 83.1  xmax < 85.2 , while the threshold incident angle x50%, at which the viewing ma- terials were barely readable by 50% of the subjects, was in a narrow range of 87.0 < x50% < 88.0 . Therefore, although the subjects were required not to guess during the experiment, they were not conÔ¨Ådent on their reading performance at display angles larger than 83.1. The loss of conÔ¨Ådence was getting worse with the in- crease of display angles.

Moreover, to correct the interference of people‚Äôs normal reading habit that lowers the values of the revised legibility in- dex LI0 (LI0 ¬º u 0.5) at large oblique display angles, another non- linear regression equation, Equation (12), was derived from Equation (11) to quantify the participants‚Äô reading performance in terms of uobserved/upredicted (ratio of the solid angle subtended by the observed threshold legible letters to the predicted one sans-serif 5  5 with equivalent legibility level). Since those capitalized letters have equivalent width (W) and height (H), their solid angle subtense (u) at different display angles could be derived using u ¬º W $H$cos x=√∞D0 √û2 ¬º H2 $cos x=√∞D0 √û2 . Therefore, at each test can be derived from Hob- Equation (12).

To answer this question, Equation (11) needs to be compared to Equation (6) in light of (i) their approximation to their original legi- bility data, and (ii) underlying physical and psychophysical funda- ments for the choice of their equation forms (power versus linear). Unfortunately, there are two limitations on direct comparison of Equations (11) and (6). First, Equations (11) and (6) were used to examine different target text. Equation (11) examines more realistic letters (sans-serif 5  5 capitalized letters C, D, E, F, H, K, N, P, R, U, V, and Z), than the single capital letter E (with H/W ¬º 1 and H/Sw ¬º 5, black/white) examined by Equation (6). Second, Equation (11) ex- amines a complete range of useful display angles (0.0e88.0 ), but Equation (6) does not examine the extremely oblique angles 82.8e 88.0 , at which the target text is still visible. As a result, a new equation, Equation (13) (R2 ¬º 0.709), was developed in this study, following the example of Equation (6) developed in the previous study (Cai et al., 2013) to approximate the legibility data using two overlapping lines.

In addition, for extremely oblique display angles larger than 85.2 , where mate- rials can no longer be readable with 100% accuracy (thus, guessing was introduced), Equation (13) underestimated the impact of display angles on legibility. In contrast, Equation (11) overestimated the impact, which is practically preferable (being conservative) to avoid guessing for enhanced legibility.  (12)  5. Validation of the new equation  Compared to Equation (12), Equation (11) is more useful in practice because it is easy to measure the height but difÔ¨Åcult to measure the solid angle u √∞u ¬º A$cos x=D2 √û of the legible letters viewed at display angles using conventional tools. Equation (11) is used to quantify the impact of display angles on the legibility of those sans-serif 5  5 capitalized letters C, D, E, F, H, K, N, P, R, U, V, and Z. Using Equation (11), predicted in practice at any possible display angles within a com- plete range of 0.0e88.0 (from 88.0 to 90.0 , the viewing mate- rials are no longer visible to the observer). Equation (11) approximates a continuous curve in the whole range of display angles (0.0e88.0 ), which Ô¨Åts the three segments of the trendline shown in Fig. 7. Nonetheless, the previous Ô¨Ånding, Equation (6), which was used to quantify the impact of display angles on the legibility of a capitalized letter E, breaks the curve into two lines to better Ô¨Åt the laboratory data.

H. Cai, L. Li  / Applied Ergonomics 45 (2014) 865e877  875  On the other hand, the choice of an appropriate form for a regression equation shall be determined by not only a better mathematical Ô¨Åt of the collected legibility data, but also the phys- ical and psychophysical fundaments of the form behind the research. As reviewed before, 24 of the 79 regression equations collected by Cai (2008) adopt the power of geometrical ratios, such as height-to-width-to ratio, height-to-strokewidth ratio, height-to- spacing ratio, to interpret the legibility of text. Stevens‚Äô power law  ¬º  j  j ¬º kfb  (Stevens, 1957) is believed the fundament behind this. Stevens‚Äô power law, as (where sensation magnitude, 4 ¬º stimulus magnitude, b ¬º constant (0.33 for brightness, 1.0 for length, 0.70 for visual area), k ¬º a proportionality constant visual that depends on the type of stimulation and the units used), is very accurate to interpret the relation between sensory magnitude judgments and the stimulus magnitude for suprathreshold per- formance, which applies to the legibility of text (Gescheider, 1985). In this case, the sensory magnitude judgment is the threshold legible subjective brightness of the text strokes or details of the background, while the stimulus magnitude is the luminance in- tensity of the text strokes and its spatial layout along the sightline. Therefore, the power of the ratio of Hobserved/Hpredicted could be used as a factor in the target legibility equation. In addition, according to Lambert‚Äôs cosine law, the luminous intensity observed from an ideal diffuse light-emitting surface (e.g., the LED display window tested in this study) is directly propor- tional to the cosine of the display angle x, as Ix ¬º I0 cos x (where Ix is the luminance intensity of the display window observed at the display angle x, I0 is the luminance intensity of the display window viewed perpendicularly). As a result, cos x could be used as a factor in the target legibility equation to interpret the luminous intensity Ix, which is the stimulus magnitude in the Stevens‚Äô power law, at different display angles. Conclusively, a continuous curve described by Equation (11), which is supported by the Stevens‚Äô power law and Lambert‚Äôs cosine law, is better than two segmented lines described by Equation (13) for quan- tifying the impact of display angles on the legibility of text in practice.  6.  Conclusions and discussion  This paper introduced a follow-up laboratory study for quanti- fying the impact of display angles on the legibility of text, to overcome the three limitations of previous studies (Cai et al., 2013; Cai and Green, 2009) on this topic, including (i) extremely oblique display angles 82.8e88.0 were not tested; (ii) more realistic let- ters need to be tested, other than the single capital letter E (with H/ W ¬º 1 and H/Sw ¬º 5, black/white); and (iii) the revised legibility index LI0 (LI0 ¬º u 0.5) cannot eliminate the interruption of people‚Äôs normal reading habit on reading performance at extreme oblique viewing angles. Based on the outcomes of this study, multiple conclusions can be drawn as follows.   This study identiÔ¨Åed a complete range of display angles 0.0e 88.0 (rather than 0.0e90.0 ), in which the viewing materials (i.e., sans-serif 5  5 capitalized letters C, D, E, F, H, K, N, P, R, U, V, and Z) could possibly be visible to an observer. Beyond 88 till 90 , the viewing materials were no long visible. The largest display angle at which the materials can still be readable with 100% accuracy was identiÔ¨Åed between 83.1 and 85.2 . Beyond critical angle till 88.0 , materials this can no longer be read conÔ¨Ådently (with 100% accuracy), thus, guessing was unavoid- able in the reading performance of those participants, although they were asked not to guess.  The continuous curve of Equation (11) is relevant with Stevens‚Äô power law and Lambert‚Äôs cosine law, which can better approximate the subjects‚Äô reading performance at different display angles. Based on Equation (11), two new legibility equations, as Equations (14) and (15), were developed by inte- grating Equations (1) and (3) into Equation (11) respectively. For Equations (14) and (15), the display angle 0.0  x  88.0 . For 88.0 < x  90.0 , materials are no longer visible to an observer. Note that Equations (14) and (15) are useful only for sans-serif 5  5 capitalized letters C, D, E, F, H, K, N, P, R, U, V, and Z.  Fig. 10.

Nonetheless, applications of the derived two equa- tions and the modiÔ¨Åed legibility index LI‚Äô‚Äô, so far, should be based on those sans-serif 5  5 capitalized letters C, D, E, F, H, K, N, P, R, U, V, and Z only, since other Sans-Serif 5  5 capitalized letters or other font types of text have different values of legibility difÔ¨Åculty index whose role on interruption of the legibility at different display angles has not yet been researched. Based on this study, those letters C, D, E, F, H, K, N, P, R, U, V, and Z can be conÔ¨Ådently used as prepared targets or reference letters in any Ô¨Åelds outside acuity tests for evaluation of legible environments. Possible appli- cations include estimation of legible sizes of those letters viewed at  sans-serif 5  5 capitalized letters C, D, E, F, H, K, N, P, R, U, V, and Z are used either as the targets or as the references. The predicted results using those Sans-serif 5  5 capitalized letters will be used as a reference in practice. This puts a limitation on examining the legibility of real text of great interests to human factors practi- tioners. To overcome this limitation, further studies need to quantify the legibility difÔ¨Åculty index of all Sans-Serif 5  5 capi- talized letters (A e Z) as well as other font types of text. Based on the indices, an adjustment factor may be added into those two equations and the modiÔ¨Åed legibility index LI00 to predict the legi- bility of real letters, which will need Ô¨Åeld validations using real text and the reference sans-serif 5  5 capitalized letters C, D, E, F, H, K, N, P, R, U, V, and Z. However, there are still two more issues that will affect the use of these three equations as well as their revised versions in the future in practice, as detailed below. Further research work is needed to resolve them..   The laboratory validation used only young people with Snellen acuity 20/20 or better and normal color vision, as the ‚Äúnormal‚Äù observer. The elderly with worse acuity levels were not addressed. Thus, legibility levels estimated using Equa- tions (14)e(16) should serve as the bottom line only. Higher legibility levels are always needed for compensating less than optimal viewing of aged observers with worse eyesight. Future study will need to consider the aging effect on legi- bility, and test the legibility equations using subjects in different age groups.  It to measure the solid angle u √∞u ¬º A$cos x=D2 √û is difÔ¨Åcult subtended by the legible characters presented at display an- gles in the Ô¨Åeld using conventional tools. Conventionally, rulers, tapes, wheel rolls, calipers, micrometers, laser distance meters, and laser rangeÔ¨Ånders can measure distances, while protractors and magnetic angle locators are used for measuring 2D angles. However, no conventional tools could be used to directly measure the projected area (i.e., A$cos x) of the legible characters viewed at display angles. Such difÔ¨Åculty the corrected LI00 may hinder the application of in practice. A new camera-aided measurement method with aid of the recently developed high dynamic range (HDR) photogram- metry (Cai, 2013) is thus in need.

s0003687013002329,"  A paramedic‚Äôs job can be described as evaluating and stabilizing patients‚Äô condition before the patients receive medical attention at the hospital. Among healthcare workers and the general popula- tion, paramedics have the highest percentage of early retirement, most often due to musculoskeletal disorders (Hogya and Ellis, 1990; Pattani et al., 2001; Rodgers, 1998; Sterud et al., 2006, 2008). More than 63% of paramedics‚Äô work accidents result from overexertion (push, pull, raise, hold, etc.) or bodily reaction (reach, lean, slip, climb, stumble, etc.) (CSST, 2012). Many studies have demonstrated that low back disorders are a common health problem among paramedics (Crill and Hostler, 2005; Hogya and Ellis, 1990; Jones and Lee, 2005; Studnek et al., 2010). One factor, or a combination of several, may underlie these low back disorders (Corbeil and Prairie, 2012). For instance, plausible explanations include the physical demands of the job (Aasa et al., 2005; Barnekow-Bergkvist et al., 2004; Putz-Anderson et al., 1997) and the execution of tasks in awkward postures (Doormaal et al., 1995). Most studies have analyzed paramedics‚Äô work using question- naires (Jones and Lee, 2005), interviews (Hignett et al., 2007) or  * Corresponding author.

We found only two studies (Doormaal et al., 1995; Ferreira and Stanley, 2005) that analyzed paramedics‚Äô posture on the job. Both studies used the Ovako working posture analysis system (OWAS method) (Karhu et al., 1977, 1981) to describe the paramedics‚Äô general posture during a work shift (Doormaal et al., 1995) or during activities performed in an ambulance‚Äôs patient compartment (Ferreira and Stanley, 2005). Doormaal et al. (1995) found that 16e29% of a work shift was spent in harmful positions and that strenuous sit- uations occurred particularly often during emergency tasks. One limitation of the OWAS method is that information is ob- tained from a static posture analysis (‚Äúsnapshot‚Äù) every 30 s. Conse- quently, the physical constraints of the job are determined by the observation of only two pictures per minute and dynamic motion assessment is ignored. However, dynamic motion characteristics may play an important role in the development of low back disorders (Davis and Marras, 2000; Marras et al., 2010). New technologies permit the more accurate collection of information about postural risk factors of dynamic trunk motion by using direct measurements of paramedics‚Äô movements obtained during Ô¨Åeld observations (Ellegast and Kupfer, 1999; Marras et al., 2010; Plamondon et al., 2007). The aim of this study was to document the trunk motion exposure of paramedics on the job using continuous recordings of

We hypothesized that trunk motion exposure to risk factors for low back disorder was likely to be more signiÔ¨Åcant when work duties were accomplished in urgent situations and also when the para- medic perceived the work duties as highly physically demanding, rather than not very physically demanding.  2.

s0003687013002330,"  Footwear manufacturing is an important sector in the Brazilian economy. Brazil is the third largest shoe manufacturer in the world (after China and India) producing 893,900 pairs of shoes per year (mainly for the North American market) in 8200 companies by 348,700 people (Abical√ßados, 2011a), representing 4.4% of the 7,885,702 employees in the industrial sector in 2010 (Brasil, 2011). The state of Rio Grande Sul, considered the most important foot- wear cluster in the world (Abical√ßados, 2011b), is responsible for 37% of employment (in 3400 companies) of the Brazilian shoe manufacturing industry (Abical√ßados, 2011a). Despite its importance, the Brazilian footwear manufacturing system is not as modern as it should be: productivity is low (Piccinini, 1990; Ruas, 1992), production is highly dependent on manual work done by minimally skilled (or unskilled) labor (Piccinini, 1990; Prochnick, 1992; Gorini and Siqueira, 1999), as is to be expected from the Taylor/Ford production system (Friedman, 1967; Dejours, 1980; Braverman, 1998) adopted in most shoe  E-mail  addresses:  * Corresponding author.

Environmental conditions are often dangerous (due to the high risk of chemicals used like glue and solvents) and workstations are risky (due to unsafe conditions of the low technology machines and equipment). Work organization where workers work on repetitive, monotonous and fragmented tasks leads to high risk of work-related musculoskeletal disorders (WMSD) (Renner, 2002, 2007), high rate of accidents (Renner, 2007; Renner et al., 2008; Guimar√£es et al., 2012), as well as high rate of turnover and absenteeism (Piccinini, 1992; Ruas, 1992; Renner, 2007; Guimar√£es et al., 2012b). Ergonomic studies focusing on WMSD risk in shoe manufacturing have been conducted in Japan (Amano et al., 1988); Mexico (Serratos-Perez and Mendiola-Anda, 1993); Italy (Agnesi et al., 1993; Del Bianco et al., 1993); USA (Drury and Wick, 1984; Wick, 1991; Center for Workplace Health Information, 1995; Burton et al., 1996); France (Roquelaure et al., 2002); Brazil (Renner, 2002); Romania (Croitoru et al., 2007); and Cuba (Herrera and Huatuco, 2011). Ahasan et al. (2002) evaluated the satisfaction with shiftwork and work in a shoe components manufacturer in Bangladesh. Few studies focused on noise (Herbert and Miles, 1991) and on the exposure to chemicals (DecouÔ¨Ç√© and Walrath, 1983; Garabrant and Wegman, 1984; Pippard and Acheson, 1985; Walker et al., 1993; Roquelaure et al., 1994; Fuh et al., 1996; Mayan et al., 1999; Jockel et al., 2000; Davila et al., 2005; Croitoru et al., 2007).

924  L.B.M. Guimar√£es et al.  / Applied Ergonomics 45 (2014) 923e935  studies at the Red Wing Shoes (Center for Workplace Health Information, 1995) at the Hanover Shoe Company (Burton et al., 1996) and in a Cuban shoe manufacturer (Herrera and Huatuco, 2011) were the only studies reporting an ergonomic intervention and evaluation of the work organization (i.e. macroergonomics), which included workstation redesign, job rotation and teamwork, exercise and conditioning program, and special training on ergo- nomics. However, they did not propose a complete modiÔ¨Åcation of the work conditions, did not detail the intervention and did not report the level of worker participation. This article presents a participatory, macroergonomic inter- vention in a Brazilian shoe manufacturing company that aimed to enhance the social, technical, and work design sub-systems of the company‚Äôs socio-technical system and improve workers‚Äô quality of life, as well as productivity and product quality. The study can be considered a special case in the Brazilian shoe-manufacturing sector, which is very traditional and often resistant to change. Actually, promoting changes by ergonomic interventions is not easy (Vink et al., 2008); but in developing countries where most foot- wear companies are located, it might be even more difÔ¨Åcult. Most factories are in developing countries because shoe manufacturing is labor intensive, competition is frequently based on price and the low wages paid in these countries are one of the ways to reduce production costs (ABDI, 2008). Ahasan et al. (2001) stressed the differences between ergonomic interventions in developing and developed countries such as the conditions of health, safety, and wellbeing of industrial workers, climate, work culture and organizational structure. While many businesses in developing countries wish to make a quick return on their investment, capital and machinery (sometimes leading to excessive working hours to increase production under unhealthy and unsafe conditions), union leaders may want to pursue the goals of the labor union organization rather than reducing the difÔ¨Åculties of work (Ahasan et al., 2001). Brazil is not an exception in this scenario. One of the characteristics of Brazilian trade unions is to Ô¨Åght for (small) increases to wages and to pay less attention to labor conditions. The country has a speciÔ¨Åc regulation on Ergonomics, named NR17 (Brasil, 1978a); the inspection of the quality of working conditions is under responsibility of the Ministry of Labor through their regional branches but there is not enough trained staff to audit all companies. Participatory ergonomics was used in the study considering that participation by both workers and managers in identifying and implementing change (e.g., Vink et al., 2008) is an essential component of a macroergonomic intervention. Macroergonomic interventions are complex and have multiple components (Neumann et al., 2010), but the participatory approach has the ability to address both physical and organizational aspects of the work system design (Brown, 1990, 1993; Nagamachi, 1995; Lanoie and Tavenas, 1996; Wilson and Haines, 1997; St-Vincent et al., 1998; Wilson, 1995; Imada, 2000; Haines et al., 2002) leading to increased levels of job communication and improved work content, which has been associated with reduced pain (Rivilis et al., 2006) as well as increase in productivity (Vink et al., 2008). Although top and middle management are usually involved in participatory interventions in developed countries (Vink et al., 2008), they are often a stumbling block in interventions in devel- oping countries (Scott, 2009): in general they are not interested in changing established operational routines to adjust to worker needs, desires and wants. In Brazil, the participatory approach is not well accepted by some who understand that the change might actually be imposed on workers (Dwyer, 2000), which jeopardizes the democratic value of the intervention. There are questions about whether participatory management in Brazilian enterprises is a tool for worker participation or worker domination, or in more  direct terms, whether it is a managerial strategy for worker manipulation (Martins, 2000), whether the workers are satisÔ¨Åed with participatory management, and whether they want a different approach (Fensterseifer, 1995). The study presented in this paper was possible due to its three- party character: besides the University, there was a governmental grant and participation of the Ministry of Labor, and the company‚Äôs industrial director who supported the research despite resistance by other directors, top and middle management as well as union ofÔ¨Åcials. Since 1994, the Brazilian shoe-manufacturing sector has been experiencing a crisis due to the opening of the commercial trade and the valorization of the Brazilian Real currency in relation to the American Dollar: this made it more difÔ¨Åcult for the Brazilian industry to compete with low-priced Chinese shoes (ABDI, 2008). Therefore, the company‚Äôs industrial director understood that the traditional production system was precarious and that the labor force was not sufÔ¨Åciently skilled to compete at a world level. He foresaw that improving the socio-technical system could make a difference to increase the company‚Äôs competitiveness in the world market, and also that the company could become a model for the Brazilian footwear manufacturing sector. The following sections describe the participatory research method, the macroergonomic intervention and its evaluation by 100 workers of the study pilot production line and their managerial staff. The validation based on social/health/safety and production results have been already reported (Guimar√£es et al., 2012b).  2. Method  The study is a longitudinal, multifactor intervention in a single shoe factory. It was conducted from May 2002 to August 2005 in one of the eight plants of the sixth largest footwear factory in Brazil, located in the Paranhana Valley, state of Rio Grande do Sul. It had 1800 employees on average during the study period and manu- factured about 22,000 pairs of shoes per month, under a Taylor/ Ford production model. The study has an action-research character based on the participatory, socio-technical approach of the Macroergonomic Work Analysis (MA) (Guimar√£es, 1999). MA encompasses the steps of a participatory ergonomics process (Vink et al., 2008): intro- duction (stage (0) named launching in MA), analysis (encompassing stage (1) appraisal and (2) diagnosis in MA), idea generation, se- lection, prototyping, testing and adjustments (all in stage (3) pro- posal of solutions in MA), implementation, and evaluation (stage (4) validation in MA), with feedback loops provided by discussion forums in between stages. The forums are a means of keeping the participants engaged and aware of the intervention process. During the 3.5 years of the intervention there were (a) four meetings of 1-h duration with the 100 workers of the pilot production line, the company‚Äôs Ergonomics Committee (COERGO), the managerial staff and the ergonomics team; and (b) thirty 30-min meetings with the COERGO. MA stages are detailed below. Stages 0, 1, 3 and 4 involve workers, management, HRD, Safety and Health Department (SHD) and union representatives in addition to the ergonomists. Stage 2 is mainly developed by the ergonomists.  2.1.  Stage 0:  launching  The objectives of stage 0 (launching) are to (1) introduce the ergonomics team; (2) discuss the objectives and intervention method with the managerial and non-managerial staff; and (3) engage workers in the study. The ergonomics team was composed of three ergonomists from the University, one of them being also an employee of the Ministry  
L.B.M. Guimar√£es et al.  / Applied Ergonomics 45 (2014) 923e935  925  of Labor, with background in medicine, physical therapy, industrial design and industrial engineering. The integration of company‚Äôs staff in the ergonomics process is often mediated by the COERGO. The studied company‚Äôs COERGO is composed of one worker representative, the safety technician, the Human Resources Department (HRD) representative; the physician; an external consultant expert in shoe manufacturing, and the ergonomist with a physical therapy background. A total of 800 workers participated in the two launching meetings (at the end of the morning shift and beginning of the evening shift) held at the company‚Äôs cafeteria. They were asked to discuss the research proposal with their colleagues not present at the meeting and were invited to volunteer for the study. One week later, the researchers received a list of 100 names of people willing to participate more directly in the study as workers of the pilot line. Although this represents a sample of convenience, it is similar to the overall worker population since it covers the ranges of age, gender, education and training of the work force. The details of the new production model and worker training were discussed with the 100 volunteers in another meeting.  2.2.  Stage 1: appraisal  Appraisal is the stage with greater company‚Äôs involvement because it is when problems to be addressed are raised and prior- itized in a participatory way. Direct participation of workers and managerial staff takes place in meetings. Surveys are done in two steps as set out in the Macroergonomic Design or MD tool (Guimar√£es and Fogliatto, 2000): (1) interviews (of a qualitative nature); and (2) questionnaires (of a quantitative nature). The semi- structured interviews are conducted with a representative sample (in general 30%) of the worker population, and based on generic questions such as: what do you think about your work? What is good? What could be better? What suggestions for improvement do you have? The interviews complemented by the knowledge of the ergonomists and their observations are the Ô¨Årst step for iden- tifying the ergonomic demand items (EDIs) that should be addressed in the intervention. The questionnaire Ô¨Ålled out by the whole population measures employee satisfaction with and/or importance given to each EDI. The questions are related to the four sub-systems (personnel, technological, work design, and external environment) of the socio- technical system. Additional questions are related to the work content and the level of pain/discomfort in some body parts. Mea- surement is done on a 15-cm continuous assessment scale (Stone et al., 1974) with two anchors (not satisÔ¨Åed/satisÔ¨Åed and/or not at all/very much); the participant marks his/her perception about the EDI on the scale. As the scale is 15-cm long, each response may vary between 0 (low) and 15 (high). The weight of each EDI is generated by the arithmetic mean of the results from all respondents. On July 2002 (while work was still taking place under the traditional system), 44 workers (24 women from the stitching sector and 20 men from the assembly sector) were interviewed by two ergonomists, individually, in a private room. Based on their comments and the ergonomists‚Äô knowledge, a questionnaire was built and used by one ergonomist with 31 workers from the pilot Ô¨Çow line: 16 workers (all women) originally from the stitching sector (which encompasses preparation and sewing/stitching) and 15 workers (60% being male) from the assembly sector (which encompasses assembly and Ô¨Ånishing). MA prescribes that the entire population (in the case, the 100 workers of the pilot line) should answer the questionnaire; but in this case, due to low schooling level, the workers needed individual assistance for answering the questionnaire; therefore, it had to be applied to a sample and distributed to each individual worker.  2.3.  Stage 2: diagnostic  Ergonomic analysis was developed by the ergonomists, taking into consideration data fromworkers‚Äô opinion obtained in the Appraisal stage, the ergonomists‚Äô observations, and the evaluation of the environmental conditions done by the Safety and Health Department (SHD). Other data on worker health conditions were obtained from the SHD database: number of absences due to ac- cidents and illness, absence from work for medical consultation and WMSD rate. Other data were absenteeism and turnover rates ob- tained from the Human Resources Department (HRD).Data on production (i.e. productivity, rate of rework and waste) were gathered by the ergonomists with the help of the company‚Äôs COERGO during Ô¨Åve months (from May to September 2002) before any improvements were implemented. Based on these data, the work conditions were evaluated and solutions for improving micro ergonomic (physical environment, workstations and equipment) and macroergonomic (work design) conditions were proposed.  2.4.  Stage 3: proposal of solutions  The 3.5-year intervention aimed to change the work organiza- tion and improve the environmental and workstations conditions according to the socio-technical approach that encompasses four sub-systems (Hendrick and Kleiner, 2001): the personnel, the external environment, the technological and the work design. Each of the four sub-systems impacts the others; but in the case of developing countries, like Brazil, it can be assumed that the external environment is the sub-system that most inÔ¨Çuences the others. The proposed solutions for each sub-system were discussed and implemented with the COERGO and the managerial and non- managerial staff. They are described in Section 3.Improvements in work organization applied only to the pilot line. Therefore, with the exception of the education for multiskilling and teamwork, the pilot line had the same characteristics of the other nine lines: the 100 pilot workers shared the same space in the plant, and used the same tools to produce the same types of shoes.  2.5.  Stage 4: evaluation  In order to evaluate the impact of the intervention on workers, in August 2005,the same questionnaire, answered three years earlier (in the appraisal stage) was answered by 32 pilot line workers (16 women and 16 men). Because participation in the survey was voluntary, the 32 workers were not the same as in 2002; therefore, the evaluation before and after the macroergonomic intervention could not be tested using paired tests. The two means (before and after the intervention) of each IDE were compared by the Student t- test for two independent samples assuming equivalent variance. The questionnaires showed good internal consistency: Cronbach‚Äôs alpha scores of 0.71 in the Ô¨Årst survey and 0.74 in the second survey. The participants, all volunteers, signed a Term of Free and Informed Consent, and a copy was handed back to the interviewee and another left with the interviewer. Managerial staff did not want to answer any questionnaire. Therefore, their evaluation of the project was obtained from in- terviews with three managers (plant general manager, sewing sector and assembly sector managers), two immediate supervisors (from the sewing and assembly sectors) and four production auxiliary (two from the sewing sector and two from the assembly sector) who help the supervisors They were interviewed separately by the same interviewer (ergonomist) who asked the following questions: How do you evaluate the project? Which were the positive aspects? Which were the negative aspects? Which were

Do you have any suggestions for the implementa- tion of the project in the whole plant?  3.  The socio-technical  intervention  Table 1 presents a timetable of actions taken to promote the improvements during the project and the actors involved. The improvements in work organization were the only one that applied only to the pilot line until 2005. Afterward, the improvements were implemented in three lines and, in 2006, to all lines of the plant.  3.1.  The external environment  The external environment deals with the survival of the com- pany, being related to its degree of adaptability, i.e. to the environ- ment in which it is inserted (Hendrick and Kleiner 2001). Footwear industry is highly dependent on the international market, Brazilian competitiveness relying solely upon the low price of shoes because of the industry‚Äôs low wages (Mody et al., 1991). However, human costs accounts for only 19% (or less) of the footwear costs; therefore, the solution for competitiveness is to compete by quality, promoting a skilled workforce for producing higher value shoes (IHU, 2011).  Another issue is the seasonality of the product: during the pe- riods of low production (December/January and May/June when new collections are developed), many companies lay off workers en masse and the opposite happens during high-production periods of sales and orders. The ‚Äúnormal‚Äù shoe-manufacturing scenario is one of peaks of high lay off and others with high hiring rates due to the necessity to adjust the number of workers to the amount of sold products. To override the impact of the external environment on the sta- bility of the workforce, the company focuses more on the internal market, therefore being less dependent on the external market.  3.2.  The personnel sub-system  The personnel sub-system basically deals with the demographic characteristics, the degree of professionalism and the psychosocial aspects related to the studied population (Hendrick and Kleiner 2001).The pilot line was composed of 100 employees, 52 of them women from the stitching sector and 48 (28 being male) from the assembly sector. The predominance of women (72%) among workers is characteristic of footwear factories in the region: the tasks assigned to the mare usually the ones of the stitching sector  
928  L.B.M. Guimar√£es et al.  / Applied Ergonomics 45 (2014) 923e935  while men are generally responsible for assembly tasks. As the stitching tasks involve the greatest number of operations over practically all models manufactured, the staff of footwear com- panies mostly consists of women. The level of education is pre- dominantly that of elementary/primary school uncompleted (59%), thus conÔ¨Årming the characteristic of the footwear industry to hire staff with low levels of education and minimally skilled (or un- skilled) labor that end up having to accept low wages. The level of professionalism (measured by worker experience in shoe manufacturing) varied from 6 months to 5 years (mean ¬º 2.5 years of experience) in the company. The reason for keeping workers in the same workstation per- forming a singletask in which they are specialized is the lack of training for multiskilling. Increasing a worker‚Äôs knowledge for other operations is considered a factor of high investment and a waste of time by some (Ruas,1992; Antunes, 1993). The most common practice is on-the-job training on a speciÔ¨Åc simple single task undertaken with support of the immediate supervisor. However, making shoes is more of a craft than mass production, since the quality of a piece of leather or of a shoe depends on cal- culations and adjustments that the worker makes while producing it (Piccinini, 1992). Shoe making requires skills from the worker to determine the shape, external appearance and tactile quality of the product. Therefore the Taylor/Ford model, which does not value multiskilled workers, cannot support the manufacturing of competitive, high-quality shoes. Personnel professionalism was improved by training workers (as described in the work design sub-system) and maintaining their jobs. None of the 100 workers from the pilot production line was dismissed during the study period.  3.3.  The technological sub-system  The technological sub-system is the technology of the work sys- tem (Hendrick and Kleiner 2001). However, as this technology has a direct connection with the work organization, in this study what falls within this sub-system are the characteristics of the physical envi- ronment, workstations, tools, machines and equipment; the type of production process and its characteristics are descriptive of the work process, and Ô¨Åts into the work design sub-system. The most important problems identiÔ¨Åed in the appraisal stage was the noise from the machines (mainly the punching and sewing machines), the risk imposed by machines/equipment due to their maintenance conditions, and the toxic chemicals in the glue. In the diagnosis stage, noise evaluation with the HSD sound level metershowed that close to the punching machines, noise was as high as 93 dB(A), exceeding the 80 dB(A) limit for workday expo- sure. Besides the risk of hearing impairment, noise is annoying and may increase the risk of accidents. Therefore, starting in March 2003, noise was gradually reduced by removing some machines that were no longer necessary in the production process. The HSD initiated a machine maintenance program to reduce noise and the risk of accidents. A similar noise control program (Herbert and Miles, 1991) obtained reduction between 4 and 10 dB(A) in a foot- wear industry where noise exceeded 90 dB(A). Although Brazilian regulation NR15 (Brasil, 1978b) prescribes the use of individual protection when noise is higher than 85 dB(A),earplugs became mandatory for workers working nearby the points of the plant where noise was higher than 80 dB(A) but could not be reduced. The most difÔ¨Åcult technical solution to implement was the substitution of solvent-based glue for water-based glue (free of harmful to health chemicals) because it takes longer to dry there- fore impacting the production Ô¨Çow. Only by 2005, a solution was found and the company introduced a water-based glue. The liter- ature concentrates on the negative impact of harmful chemicals in  the leather, glue and solvents on worker health. However, the impact on the environment is also a relevant issue when pursuing sustainable production systems, as discussed with the participants many times during the project. To improve the workstations‚Äô design, 800 seats (one for two workers) were made available for allowing workers to switch be- tween standing and sitting postures, therefore also attending regulation NR17 (Brasil, 1978a). The layout, however, continued as a straight line because of the plant‚Äôs restricted space, which did not favor arranging a more appropriate layout. Compact layouts such as a U shape or circle, as proposed by Black (1991), would permit greater proximity among operators, thus facilitating exchange of communication, information and materials.  3.4.  The work design sub-system  The work design sub-system deals with the complexity (i.e. level of formalization and centralization) of the company (Hendrick and Kleiner 2001). In this study, this sub-system encompasses the schedule of working hours and how work is organized considering: (a) how production takes place, i.e. the technology of production; (b) the action of individuals on an object in order to modify it, i.e. the technology of knowledge; and (c) the degree of automation, rigidity of the work Ô¨Çow and speciÔ¨Åc aspects of tasks or integration of workÔ¨Çow. Depending on the world competition, the company under study produces more intensively either for the internal or the external market. The demand for the internal market is often for small lots (30e50 pairs) while demand for the external market is for large lots (3000e5000 pairs of shoes in each lot) of a wide range of models, thus leading to production by batch. The shoe models in production may change Ô¨Åve to ten times during a working day, which means there is a need to set up quickly to minimize waste of production time. In accordance with the model to be produced, changes occur in layout and alteration or addition of workstations, even though workers continue carrying out the same task at the same work- station during the entire work day.  3.4.1.  Change in work organization  Although the footwear sector adopts the Taylor/Ford production model, demand for increasingly varied lots of products is better supported by more dynamic and Ô¨Çexible systems, such as the socio- technical model (Berggren, 1992) and lean production (LP) (Shingo, 1981; Ohno, 1988). Therefore, the proposed model followed the precepts of the socio-technical teamwork organization, as applied in the automotive Volvo plants at Kalmar and Udevalla in Sweden (Berggren, 1992), but it also considered LP principles of Toyota Japan, such as process uniformity and clear procedures for reaching production targets and product quality. The importance of pro- cedures to meet production demand, widely covered by LP theo- rists (Shingo, 1981; Ohno, 1988), is a gap in the Volvo production model (Berggren, 1992). Because workers lacked the necessary skills to adjust to the variability and complexity of an integrated production Ô¨Çow, the 100 volunteers of the pilot line were trained for multiskilling and teamwork. After March 2003, they were trained to work in all workstations for manufacturing any type of shoes at anytime. They worked in teams of 6e8 people that were responsible for the quality of both production and products of their cells. Groups of tasks were formed by proximity in the line as per Fig. 1 and Table 2 in the assembly sector, and Fig. 2 and Table 3 in the stitching sector. Initially, workers changed tasks every 2 h, as suggested by the immediate supervisors, until the team members took upon them- selves the autonomy to decide when to rotate. Most workers

Colors indicate how teams were formed in the pilot line for assembling a certain shoe model.  change tasks at least four times during the working day, and rotation happens between the Ô¨Årst and third hour of the work shift. Despite the traditional belief that it would be very difÔ¨Åcult to train workers to perform different tasks, a study of their learning curve (Guimar√£es et al., 2012a) showed that they were able to learn all required tasks within a month. After four months, workers started getting more comfortable with the new system and most of them were handling 20 tasks. It is interesting to note that a 4-month period to get used to a new system was also reported in studies at the Mitsubishi Electric‚Äôs Fukuyama Plant (Nagamachi, 1996) and at a Brazilian electricity meter assembly plant (Guimar√£es, 2009). Some workers can master, in the long run, more than 150 operations of a more complex type of shoe (like a boot, for example).  3.4.2.  Change in working hours  Employees work 8.8 h per day (for a 9.3-h work day), 44 h per week, 22 days per month. When the project started, work was done in two shifts: shift 1 from 5:00 AM to 2:48 PM, and shift 2 from 2:48 PM to 00:17 AM, a schedule set to accommodate about the double of the number of employees. Because the company was no longer employing so many people, and shift 1 started at dawn, the schedule was analyzed using July 2002 evaluation of the physiological con- ditions and the quality of sleep of a sample of 44 volunteer workers (the same 24 women from the stitching sector and 20 men from the assembly who were interviewed) from shift 1 of the plant. The physiological evaluation was done by the HSD using data on plasmatic glucose level, blood pressure and heart frequency. Blood sample was obtained at the beginning of shift 1 from a drop of blood collected with a Ô¨Ånger stick. Results showed that 82% of workers do not eat breakfast and their glycemic level was 70 mg/dL, (t ¬º 1.845; p ¬º 0.072) lower than the group that eats breakfast (glycemic level ¬º 79.88 mg/dL). No statistical difference was found  frequency (mean ¬º 81 beats/min) for heart and blood pressure (mean ¬º 115  75 mmHg) between the two groups. Because the company was not convinced of the need to change the work schedule, in July 2003, 153 workers (about 10% of the plant population at the time), i.e. 80 workers from shift 1 and 73 from shift 2, answered a questionnaire on the quality of sleep, satisfaction with the traditional schedule, and the best working hours for a new schedule. The questionnaire showed that 85% of the respondents were morning type people, preferring to work during the day as long as a daycare center was made available so the parents could work in only one shift. In August 2003, the results were presented to the majority of the plant‚Äôs population (8 meetings with about 100 workers each) and a new work schedule was deÔ¨Åned. In January 2004, the schedule was changed from two shifts to one shift: Monday to Thursday from 6:30 AM to 5:15 PM (with a lunch break from 11:30 AM to12: 30 PM); and Friday from 6:30 AM to 11:30 AM. In April 2004, to meet an increase in production de- mand and also because the daycare was not operating, the schedule turned back to two shifts. As evaluated by the production manager, the change to the traditional schedule had a negative impact on productivity during the months of April to July. Therefore, in August 2004, taking the opportunity of another downsizing to adjust the number of employees because of a decrease in production demand, the daycare started to operate again and the one-shift schedule, voted by all employees, was deÔ¨Ånitely set from 7:00 AM to 4:48 PM from Monday to Friday (with a lunch break from 11:30 AM to 12:30 PM). Lunch has been always provided by the company.  4.

Worker opinion on improvements in the physical environment and workstation  The elimination of some machines and maintenance improve- ment did reduce noise (t-test ¬º 6.006, p-value < 0.01), while satis- faction with temperature and lighting did not change, as expected, since no improvements were made in these conditions. The in- (t-test ¬º 5.443, p-val- crease in satisfaction with work postures ue < 0.01) is probably related to improvements of the workstation (t-test ¬º 2.511, p-value ¬º 0.01); in particular, the seats allowed workers to alternate between sitting and standing positions.  4.2. Worker opinion on improvements in the work design  Satisfaction with the work schedule before the intervention (two shifts) and after the intervention (one shift) could not be assessed by the pre- and post-questionnaires. The Ô¨Årst questionnaire measured worker demands, and schedule was not identiÔ¨Åed as an IDE at that  time. Despite being of interest to ergonomists, by the time the Ô¨Årst questionnaire was created (August 2002), there was no indication that working hours could be changed; therefore, there was no question on work schedule. Assessment of work schedule was done in a separate questionnaire, a year later, and was answered by a sample of the population plant, not the workers on the pilot line. Adjustments for the new schedule were discussed in meetings with workers and the Ô¨Ånal schedule was approved by the majority of them and in agreement with the company‚Äôs management. During the August 2004 meeting, workers indicatedthat they were satisÔ¨Åed with the one-shift schedule and with the daycare center. The EDIs related to work organization showed the most im- provements in relation to the intervention. Before the intervention, the EDIs that had been considered the most unsatisfactory were those of ‚Äúbeing lent‚Äù to another production line (i.e. being trans- ferred from the original line to help balance another line) and ‚Äúbeing accountable for Ô¨Çaws in the shoe‚Äù. These managerial stra- tegies are considered critical by workers in the shoe-manufacturing sector, but are common in most industries.

Satisfaction with the EDI ‚Äúbeing accountable for Ô¨Çaws in the shoe‚Äù also almost (t-test ¬º 5.492, doubled after the intervention p-value < 0.01). Before the intervention, this responsibility resulted in embarrass- ment for the worker :using control devices in the process, it was possible to identify the person who had generated the Ô¨Çaw. The intervention diluted this responsibility among workers in the team who enjoyed being responsible for ‚Äúquality control‚Äù (t-test ¬º 2.640, p-value ¬º 0.01). Besides, multiskilling and teamwork improved the quality of products: rework was reduced by 85% and spoilage by (t-test ¬º 2.228, p- 69%. The EDIs ‚Äúrelationship with supervisors‚Äù value ¬º 0.03), ‚Äúsupport from the worker (‚ÄòJoker‚Äô) who helps/sub- (t-test ¬º 2.850, p-value < 0.01) and stitutes another if necessary‚Äù (t-test ¬º 3.597, ‚Äúaccess to material supplies‚Äù p-value < 0.01)  showed improvement, as a result of improved communication and interaction achieved by teamwork and the participatory ergo- nomics process. The results for ‚Äúpace of the conveyor belt‚Äù, ‚Äútraining/skills of the staff ‚Äú, and ‚Äúrelationship with colleagues‚Äù did not show improvement.  4.3. Worker opinion on improvements in the company  In relation to employee satisfaction with the company, three EDIs showed improvement. Before the intervention, workers needed to stay out of the building, even under the rain, waiting for the gate to open. When the company learned about the problem, the time for opening the gate during rainy days was changed to earlier hours; this initiative was welcomed by employees (t- test ¬º 8.292, p-value < 0.01). The quality of lunch also improved (t-

Guimar√£es et al.  / Applied Ergonomics 45 (2014) 923e935  test ¬º 4.129, p-value < 0.01), and some effort was put into encour- aging people to increase their level of schooling by attending free classes after work (t-test ¬º 2.205, p-value ¬º 0.03). The company had always supported a school program at the site, but attendance was usually low because most workers do not like to stay at the plant longer hours and some even feel too old to attend classes. No changes were made in relation to the EDI ‚Äúoutpatient clinic‚Äù that was always considered good and the salary did not increase, therefore satisfaction with wage remained at the same low level. It is important to note that, during the intervention, wage was always discussed with the managerial staff, the research team pointing out the importance of adjusting salaries since the pilot line workers became multiskilled. At the end of the study, workers started to be paid according to their skill levels.  4.4. Worker opinion on improvements in the work content  The EDIs related to the work content were the most signiÔ¨Åcant in terms of value added to work. After the intervention, work was perceived as more stimulating (t-test ¬º 2.120, p-value ¬º 0.04), more (t-test ¬º 4.569, creative p-value < 0.01) and more dynamic (t- test ¬º 3.970, p-value < 0.01), due to reduction in repetitiveness (t- test ¬º  5.318, p-value < 0.01) and tasks being more diversiÔ¨Åed (t- test ¬º 4.850, p-value < 0.01). Frustration decreased (t- test ¬º  3.069, p-value < 0.01) and workers reported more auton- omy in their work (t-test ¬º 3.162, p-value < 0.01). These positive results were expected as a result of the work enlargement and enrichment provided by the new production model. Perceived risk decreased (t-test ¬º  2.811, p-value < 0.01); this can be explained by the elimination of toxic glue and improvement in equipment maintenance. However, improvements in work organization did not alter worker perception of physical and mental effort, monotony and limitation of the work, which remained at the same medium level. Although work became more stimulating and dynamic, workers understand that producing footwear only is monotonous and limiting. Results show that training and empowerment conferred to workers and teams have no effect on EDIs related to the stress imposed by production demand. Although the relationship with managers (mainly with top managers) improved, production goals have to be met, therefore workers continue to feel the same level of pressure, nervousness and responsibility for performing work efÔ¨Åciently. Overall satisfaction increased (t-test ¬º 4.105, p-value < 0.01) and workers prefer to work in more than a single workstation (t- test ¬º  3.203, p-value < 0.01). This supports the value of the new work organization focusing on multiskilling, job enlargement and enrichment. It is worth noting that despite the problems of the old traditional manufacturing system, workers have always felt valued by the company and like to work in the shoe-manufacturing sector.  4.5. Worker perception of discomfort and pain  Results on perception of discomfort and pain show low level of pain in the head and moderate pain in the back (in accordance to Wick, 1991; Serratos-Perez and Mendiola-Anda, 1993; and Burton et al., 1996) and neck (in accordance to Wick, 1991). Pain in these body parts can be related to the need for trunk Ô¨Çexion and for head leaning forward for better visual control of the work in nearly all operations of footwear manufacturing. In general, the pieces are small and many shoes have small elements, such as decoration and small rivets. Pain in the legs was also evaluated as moderate, but pain in the feet that was high before the intervention showed a (t-test ¬º 3.513, reduction p-value < 0.01) after the intervention.  Pain in legs and feet is often attributed to prolonged static standing up position (Renner, 2002), therefore reduction of pain/discomfort in the feet might be explained by workers switching between standing and sitting postures after the introduction of seats.  4.6. Management opinion on the implemented solutions  For management, the positive result of the project was that multiskilled workers were able to balance production set up and workÔ¨Çow, and to control product quality. Greater knowledge and Ô¨Çexibility of the pilot line workers were recognized as fundamental to respond faster and more accurate to the demand of the pro- duction mix in the footwear sector. The negative aspect is related to the difÔ¨Åculty in dealing with skilled workers since they no longer accept what is imposed without questioning. Mainly the immediate supervisors were intimidated by worker empowerment (i.e. by their greater autonomy and knowledge of the process as a whole). It became evident that the teams could not follow supervisors‚Äô orders and still meet production targets. Managers did not make any suggestions for the implementation of the project in the whole plant.  5. Discussion  From 2002 to 2005, improvements in work environment, workstations and work schedule implemented in the plant affected about 1800 workers. However, only 100 volunteer workers, rep- resentatives of the population, were trained to work in teams to perform a variety of tasks and became responsible for the quality of both production and Ô¨Ånal product. The intervention might be considered successful: multiskilling and teamwork granted more Ô¨Çexibility and autonomy to the pilot line workers, which were key elements for reducing human costs and improving the quality of both process and products. Work content improved and the pilot line workers better understood the whole production system: they became key partners in the com- pany since they were the only multiskilled workers who were apt to quickly perform multiple tasks in the diversiÔ¨Åed mix of daily production. The introduction of seats made it possible for alternating be- tween sitting and standing postures, therefore reducing pain in the feet. Although the workstations improvements did not reduce pain in upper limbs and back, work enlargement and enrichment enabled the use of different muscles, made work more interesting, eliminating WMSD and illnesses from the pilot line. The literature (Carayon et al., 1999; Rivilis et al., 2006) emphasizes the positive impact of better work design and content on the reduction of WMSD risk. Based on data collected between May and September 2002, and data reported by the HSD in 2005, WMSD, medical consultations and turnover were eliminated in the pilot line and accidents were reduced by 80% in comparison to the other lines that operated under the traditional system (Guimar√£es et al., 2012b). Besides, as discussed by Guimar√£es et al. (2012b), absen- teeism was reduced by 46%, productivity increased by 3%, and the rates of defect and rework were reduced to less than 1%. The beneÔ¨Åt-to-cost ratio of the intervention was 7.2, conÔ¨Årming the economic beneÔ¨Åts of macroergonomics. Other macroergonomic interventions in the footwear industry also demonstrated their value due to their positive impact on production (Herrera and Huatuco, 2011) and on quality of work life (Center for Workplace Health Information, 1995; Burton et al., 1996; Herrera and Huatuco, 2011), although some ergonomic risk factors may persist, particularly for the upper extremities (Burton et al., 1996). The implemented changes also improved relationship and communication in the shop-Ô¨Çoor. Despite the special situation of  
L.B.M. Guimar√£es et al.  / Applied Ergonomics 45 (2014) 923e935  933  the pilot workers, no problems were raised between them and the workers from other lines. They were comfortable dealing with the researchers, the COERGO representatives and even with top man- agers, expressing their points of view, suggestions and complaints. However, their empowerment resulted in many conÔ¨Çicts with the immediate supervisors who did not know how to deal with the numerous changes. The pilot line workers were aware that they were a special group: besides getting more experienced and empowered as compared with their colleagues from other lines, they became key actors of a project that was the driver for a radical change in the company. It is worth noting that confounding variables, such as change in behavior, were not controlled for in the study. Hawthorne effect, besides being ambiguous and disputable (Adair, 1984; Jones, 1992; Wickstr√∂m and Bendix, 2000; Holden 2001) is difÔ¨Åcult to evaluate in this study. Although the pilot line workers became a special group in the company, the Hawthorne effect might not have had an impact on the outcomes given the long duration of the study. Be- sides, based on data from the HRD and HSD, and the opinion of the industrial manager, the human-related and production results of the other lines were better in 2005 than in 2002, suggesting that the improvements in the environment, workstations and the change in work schedule had a positive effect on the whole plant. Therefore, the improved results in the pilot line in comparison to other lines might be attributable to improvements in the work organization, which were implemented only in this line. Due to the success of the new production model, the 100 workers started to teach the other 1700 employees in the company how to work under the new model. As of November 2005, three other lines had been set up for multiskilling and teamwork and, by 2006, the model was implemented in the whole Paranhana plant. Some of the workers of the pilot line are, nowadays, production supervisors. Some Ô¨Ånal comments should be made on the method and development of the intervention. The participatory nature of the method was useful for identifying important issues to address (for example, the time of gate opening) that otherwise would not have been considered by the ergonomists. Most important, the partici- patory method engaged workers very easily. Meetings made it easier to proceed with more appropriate interventions since tacit knowledge was embedded in the project. Although the macroergonomic approach is another strength of the intervention process, it imposed some limitations to the study. Many changes were made at the same time in accordance to the company‚Äôs interest and/or budget schedule; this made it difÔ¨Åcult to evaluate the impact of each improvement separately. For example, the new work schedule might have impacted considerably the re- sults since it increased time for sleep and workers were able to have breakfast before leaving for work. However, it was not possible to assess the separate impact of the new schedule on worker and production outcomes. Another limitation of the macroergonomic approach is the dif- Ô¨Åculty for carrying out the research, which was only possible due to the interest of the industrial director and the Brazilian Ministry of Labor as well as the governmental grant support. Although workers were very enthusiastic about the project, the project was perceived as a threat by supervisors and middle managers. They raised some problems in the pilot line, some improvements took longer to be implemented, and important information for the study (such as production outcomes) could not be easily accessed. This problem with the managerial staff has been reported in other studies (Guimar√£es, 2009), and is not particular to this company. It might be attributed to the difÔ¨Åculty of implementing ergonomics in Bra- zilian companies. Macroergonomics is difÔ¨Åcult to implement (Vink et al., 2008) even in developed countries.  6.  Conclusion  This study discussed the experience of a 3.5-year macro- ergonomic intervention and its assessment by 100 pilot line workers and managerial staff of a large footwear factory in the state of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. Work schedule changed from two shifts (morning and evening) to one shift (morning), and a daycare was implemented so parents could work in only one shift. The removal of some machines along with an equipment/machines maintenance program reduced noise level. Harmful chemicals were gradually eliminated from the plant. Workers could alternate postures after the introduction of seats. Improvements in workstations reduced discomfort and pain in the feet. However, the most inÔ¨Çuential elements of the intervention are related to improvements in work organization and content in the pilot line. The aspects most valued by pilot line workers were in- crease in creativity, work being more dynamic and tasks being more diversiÔ¨Åed. Autonomy increased and frustration decreased; illnesses and WMSD risk were eliminated from the pilot production line. These outcomes are related to work enlargement and enrichment. Teamwork and participatory ergonomics empowered workers, increased communication, satisfaction with work and commitment with results and company targets, reÔ¨Çecting on improved relationship with top managers. However, if from the point of view of workers the imple- mentation of the socio-technical system was positive, their im- mediate supervisors and middle managers were very resistant to the intervention. Despite their resistance, the project can be considered successful: the industrial director was receptive and improvements made in the Paranhana plant were implemented in six other plants owned by the company under the supervision of one of the ergonomists that nowadays acts as a consultant and is part of the COERGO.

s0003687013002342,"  1.1.  Background  Many daily activities require people to enter numeric informa- tion using a keypad. For example, telephones, smart phones, cal- culators, computers, automated-teller-machines (ATMs), and home alarm systems all have keypads that people frequently use to enter strings of digits. Likewise, there is a wide variety of numerical in- formation that is entered into keypad devices, including phone numbers, account numbers, birthdates, and currency values. Two observations about keypads motivated the current research. First, many people are not explicitly aware that the number keypad layout differs across devices such as telephones and calculators (Rinck, 1999). Second, people typically interact with many of the above devices with conÔ¨Çicting numeric keypad layouts on a daily basis, yet intuitively performance does not seem to show drastic consequences of keypad arrangement inconsistency. Additionally, with more technological devices pervading common human experience, research on layouts of keypads is as relevant today as ever. With hundreds of laptops and telephones, dozens of tablets  * Corresponding author. Tel.: √æ1 765 494 5132. E-mail address: tredick@purdue.edu (T.S. Redick).  and other devices on the market, ergonomic keyboard and keypad layout is a concern for buyers and designers. Despite the frequent use of telephones and calculator/computer keypads, individuals exhibit surprisingly poor memory when explicitly asked to reproduce the layout of numbers on these de- vices (Fig. 1). For example, Rinck (1999, Experiment 1) tested col- lege students on their ability to correctly place the digits on a blank sheet using their memory for the layout of either a telephone or a calculator. Accuracy for the correct placements of the digits 1 to 9 was 78% for the telephone versus 48% for the calculator layout. That is, approximately one-half of the college students tested could not explicitly recall the location of the digits on a calculator keypad, as presented in Fig. 1. In addition, Rinck found that when participants made errors, especially on the calculator layout, they reversed the layout (for example, entered the layout for numbers on a telephone when they were supposed to enter the layout of a calculator). Jones and Martin (2009) also found relatively low recall for the calculator layout in their sample of college students. Only about 25% of the participants in the control group, which was not provided with any strategies or explicit instructions, reproduced the calculator layout in its entirety with all of the digits in the correct location. In contrast, the same participants reproduced the telephone layout with near-perfect accuracy. Rinck (1999) provided evidence that there is interference that occurs when accessing the mental representation of keypad  0003-6870/$ e see front matter √ì 2013 Elsevier Ltd and The Ergonomics Society.

Armand et al.  / Applied Ergonomics 45 (2014) 917e922  versus the calculator layout also applies to other tasks such as entering personal identiÔ¨Åcation numbers and single digits (Straub and Granaas, 1993). It should be noted that much of this research was conducted at a time when computer keypad usage was rare. Indeed, prior to the 1980s, personal computers were not commonly used in homes and businesses, thus limiting people‚Äôs exposure to the calculator keypad layout relative to today. Marteniuk et al. (1996) tested college students on their ability to enter four-digit strings, seven-digit strings, and seven-digit tele- phone numbers using either a calculator or a telephone keypad layout. Marteniuk et al. focused on the effect of the placement of the zero-digit key (above or below the other keys) across keypad layout types. Although Marteniuk et al. concluded, against their predictions, that ‚Äúno interactions between the task and the keypad arrangement were found‚Äù (p. 325), in the article they only reported the separate analyses conducted for the different stimulus formats. Without the beneÔ¨Åt of signiÔ¨Åcance testing, visual inspection of the data indicates that participants were faster and more accurate entering telephone numbers compared to seven-digit strings without telephone formatting. However, they reported no signiÔ¨Å- cant effects of keypad layout on either accuracy or the total amount of time to enter the string of digits. The three studies just discussed provide contradictory results. The conclusion from two studies (Conrad and Hull, 1968; Deininger, 1960) is that there is a slight advantage for the telephone layout no matter if the user is entering telephone or numeric information. However, Marteniuk et al. (1996) found no signiÔ¨Åcant effects of keypad layout. The participants in Deininger (1960) and Conrad and Hull (1968) are somewhat unique in that they participated in the research with no history or exposure to the telephone layout, due in part to limited availability of technology in the 1960s. In contrast, in today‚Äôs society in many developed countries, virtually all young adults have extensive exposure and practice using telephones and calculators. Thus, the participants in Marteniuk et al. (1996) may not have shown an advantage of either type of keypad arrangement because of their experience with both telephone and calculator layouts that the participants in the earlier studies did not have.  1.2.  Current research  The current study combines elements of both Rinck (1999, Experiment 1) and Marteniuk et al. (1996), but attempted to expand upon their studies in multiple ways. First, in contrast to Rinck (1999), we tested participants‚Äô knowledge of telephone and calculator layouts using a within-subjects design. Additionally, a potentially important aspect of the stimuli that Marteniuk et al. used was that the numeric stimuli were presented as one contin- uous sequence of seven digits (e.g., 1947294), whereas the phone numbers were presented with a hyphen (e.g., 396e8142). Because of concerns that the phone stimuli were easier for participants in Marteniuk et al. to chunk in short-term memory, in the current research we added commas to the numeric digit strings to provide comparable chunks for participants to utilize. In addition, we tested all participants on their ability to enter all 10 digits on the keypad on each trial, whether as a numerical [1,234,567,890] or phone [(123) 456-7890] presentation. This decision provided two advan- tages over Marteniuk et al. First, by including all possible digits once in each stimulus, we controlled across trials for effects of key position upon performance (see below). Second, with the wide- spread use of cell phones, many dialed numbers today in the United States are ten digits, and thus the current stimuli may be more similar to the numbers dialed in daily telephone usage. Finally, in the current research we tested over twice as many participants and administered twice as many trials per condition than Marteniuk et al., because some trends that were not statistically signiÔ¨Åcant in  Fig. 1. From ‚ÄúMemory for everyday objects: Where are the digits on numerical key- pads?‚Äù by Rinck (1999), Applied Cognitive Psychology, 13, p. 330. Copyright 1999 by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.  layouts. However, in practice most individuals are able to switch between devices with relative ease. For example, consider the many work-related tasks completed by a pharmacy technician. She may spend much of her time at work dialing phone numbers into a phone to call customers to tell them their prescriptions are ready, insurance companies to clarify beneÔ¨Åt information, or doctors‚Äô ofÔ¨Åces to verify dosage and medical history. However, she likely also spends a lot of time entering numeric information, including customers‚Äô phone numbers and insurance account numbers, into the computer using the keypad (which is arranged like a calculator). Another example of an occupation where the user enters a variety of different numeric information is a ticket agent for an airline. When checking in for a Ô¨Çight at the airport, an airline ticket agent may use the numeric keypad on a desktop keypad (which matches a calculator layout) to enter the passen- ger‚Äôs conÔ¨Årmation number, airline rewards number, driver‚Äôs li- cense identiÔ¨Åcation number, phone number, birthdate, and credit card number. With the advent of alternative telecommunication options, voice-over-internet-protocol users typically use computer numeric keypads to dial telephone numbers. Students working in a research lab often enter various types of numeric information into statistical software packages using the numeric keypad on a desktop computer. Therefore, the purpose of the current research is to determine if entering different types of numeric information is quicker and more accurate with the telephone or the calculator layout. Previous research on this topic has been inconsistent and may be outdated. Deininger (1960) conducted research at Bell Labora- tories testing different potential layouts for new touchtone tele- phone devices. In one experiment, employees entered random phone numbers on 16 possible different layouts, including the then-current arrangement of adding machines (calculators) and the present-day arrangement of telephones (not currently in use). Deininger reported that participants were slightly faster using the telephone (4.92 s) versus the calculator (5.08 s) layout, but no ac- curacy information was reported. Conrad and Hull (1968) tested participants with no experience using a touchtone telephone or adding machine, and examined their performance at entering random 8-digit strings. The group of participants that used the telephone layout was more accurate than the group that used the calculator layout, although the groups did not statistically differ in the speed of correct digit entry. These results correspond with research assessing users‚Äô prefer- ences for potential keypad layouts. The majority of na√Øve and experienced participants indicate a preference for the telephone versus the calculator layout (Lutz and Chapanis, 1955). This prefer- ence is especially strong when participants are asked to imagine scenarios in which they would enter telephone numbers, but somewhat surprisingly, the preference for the telephone layout  
J.T. Armand et al.  / Applied Ergonomics 45 (2014) 917e922  919  (N ¬º 24  their study might have been due to insufÔ¨Åcient power participants in Marteniuk et al.). We predicted that, as in Rinck (1999), participants would be less accurate to explicitly recall the spatial layout of calculators compared to telephones. For the computerized task described below, when participants were asked across four different blocks to enter numeric or phone stimuli into either a calculator or telephone keypad, we predicted an overall advantage for entering phone stimuli, based on Marteniuk et al. (1996). However, in contrast to that research, we also predicted that we would observe an inter- action of stimulus type and layout type, such that participants would be less accurate and/or slower in conditions of mismatching stimuli and layouts (e.g., numeric stimuli into a telephone keypad). Our interest in potential task-speciÔ¨Åc interactions of stimulus type and keypad layout motivated our Ô¨Ånal prediction. As stated previously, the middle row (4, 5, 6) on the keypad is the same for both telephone and calculator layouts. However, the top and bot- tom rows are mapped in an opposite fashion in the two layouts (Fig. 1). If, for example, users experience interference from the mental representation of the telephone keypad layout while using the calculator layout, then performance should be worse specif- ically for responses using the top and bottom rows of the keypad. Thus, we examined performance as a function of the row that was used for each of the 10 responses made on a given trial.  2. Method  2.1.  Participants  Participants for this study were students or community volun- teers recruited from the campus of a small Midwestern university. Sixty-two participants completed the study; after removing par- ticipants who did not comply with instructions or had extremely low accuracy on the computerized task (see below), the Ô¨Ånal sample was comprised of 57 participants (40 female, 17 male), with a mean age of 26.9 (12.4) years old. We specify our rule for terminating data collection based on a recent recommendation by Simmons et al. (2011). SpeciÔ¨Åcally, the Ô¨Årst-author conducted the study as part of her capstone research project for graduation, supervised by the second- and third-author. The prescribed rule for all students completing capstone research projects during the academic year was to recruit and test a mini- mum of 60 participants, and data collection had to be completed by a certain date speciÔ¨Åed in advance.  2.2.  Procedure  All participants Ô¨Årst completed a memory test similar to Rinck (1999). Participants were asked, in order, to provide the digit layout for a telephone, a calculator, and an ATM. Participants were given feedback after completing the memory test. Performance on the memory test was scored as the accuracy of participants‚Äô recall. If participants reproduced the keypad layout in its entirety with no mistakes in the placement of the numbers, their answer was considered correct (see Fig. 1). After entering demographic information, participants then completed the main part of the experiment. Across four blocks, participants took part in a repeated-measures 2 (numeric or tele- phone number stimulus)  2 (calculator or phone keypad layout) experiment in which they participated in all four conditions: (a) entering phone stimuli [(123) 456-7890] using a telephone layout; (b) entering numeric stimuli (1,234,567,890) using a telephone layout; (c) entering phone stimuli using a calculator layout; and (d) entering numeric stimuli using a calculator layout. Participants were randomly assigned to one of four possible task orders, which  were counterbalanced using a Latin square design. The counter- balancing of the order of task conditions was done to prevent any practice effects that might be observed if all participants had used one keyboard format before the other, or entered one stimulus type before the other. The particular task orders were chosen to: (a) have each condition appear as the Ô¨Årst, second, third, or fourth condition across participants; and (b) allow the experimenter to switch the keyboard only once for each participant, halfway through the computerized task to minimize disruption. Stimuli were 10-digit sequences that were either presented in the numerical [1,234,567,890] or phone [(123) 456-7890] format. All stimuli were randomly generated before the experiment with the constraints that: (a) every 0e9 digit appeared in each stimulus; (b) no digit appeared more than once within a stimulus; and (c) the digit 0 could not appear as the Ô¨Årst number in the sequence. Note that the Ô¨Årst two constraints produced stimuli that differed from Martenuik et al. (1996), in that their seven-digit stimuli did not contain all 10 possible responses and digits could repeat within a stimulus. Stimuli were presented in the center of the screen, and formatted so that the 10 digits appeared in the same 10 absolute locations onscreen regardless of the stimulus type. For each of the four stimulus-layout conditions, participants completed a total of 50 trials. The Ô¨Årst 10 trials were practice, and were indicated as such to the participants. During the 10 practice trials, participants received performance feedback. These trials were not analyzed, but ensured that participants understood the instructions. Participants then completed 40 trials without feed- back that were analyzed. Each trial started with a Ô¨Åxation screen until the participant pressed the spacebar with his or her non- dominant hand. The 10-digit stimulus then appeared onscreen, and the participants were instructed to type the numbers into the keypad as quickly and accurately as possible. A cursor appeared under the current digit in the sequence, and advanced to the next digit after the response was keyed. Once the 10-digit number was entered, the next Ô¨Åxation screen appeared. Both accuracy and re- action time were measured. Accuracy for each stimulus-by-layout condition on the computerized task was derived by obtaining the mean of each participant‚Äôs mean accuracy, where all 10 digits must be entered in the correct order to be considered correct. Response time (RT) for each stimulus-by-layout condition on the computer- ized task was derived by obtaining the mean of each participant‚Äôs mean time to type the entire 10 digit string, from the moment the stimuli appeared onscreen until the moment the participant pressed the 10th key. As is the common practice in psychological research, we only included correct responses in the analyses of the RT data.  2.3. Materials  For the initial memory test, participants used pencil and paper to record the answers. For the computerized task, participants completed a program created in E-Prime 2.0 (Psychology Software Tools, Pittsburgh, PA). Stimuli were presented visually in the center of the computer monitor screen, and participants used the number keypad of the computer keyboard to enter their responses. For the calculator layout, the standard number keypad layout was used. For the telephone layout, the buttons for the top and bottom rows of the keypad were exchanged.  2.4. Analyses  Repeated-measures analyses of variance (ANOVAs) were used for each of the dependent variables in the study. An alpha of .05 was used for signiÔ¨Åcance testing, except where noted in follow-up

Memory test  Results from the explicit memory test (N ¬º 56 due to incomplete data from one participant) were analyzed with a repeated- measures ANOVA with the factor Layout (Telephone, Calculator, ATM). The main effect of Layout was signiÔ¨Åcant, F(2, 110) ¬º 20.75, p ¬º .274. Follow-up paired t-tests, using a Bonferroni- p < .001, h2 corrected a (.05/3 ¬º .016), indicated that participants were more accurate in their recall of the telephone (95%) layout than either the ATM (68%) or calculator (41%) layout (all p‚Äôs < .013).  3.2.  Computerized task  h2  Overall accuracy and RT results from the computerized task were analyzed with a repeated-measures ANOVA with the factors Stimulus (Phone, Numeric) and Layout (Telephone, Calculator). Looking Ô¨Årst at accuracy (Fig. 2), the main effect of Layout was signiÔ¨Åcant, F(1, 56) ¬º 5.98, p ¬º .018, h2 p ¬º .097, with participants more accurate using the calculator layout (87%) versus the tele- phone layout (83%). The main effect of Stimulus was not signiÔ¨Åcant, F(1, 56) ¬º .11, p ¬º .746, h2 p ¬º .002, and neither was the interaction, F(1, 56) ¬º 1.26, p ¬º .267, h2 p ¬º .022. The results for the mean RTs on correct trials are shown in Fig. 3. The signiÔ¨Åcant main effects of Stimulus, F(1, 56) ¬º 39.30, p < .001, p ¬º .412, and Layout, F(1, 56) ¬º 39.96, p < .001, h2 p ¬º .416, were interaction, F(1, 56) ¬º 18.44, p < .001, qualiÔ¨Åed by a signiÔ¨Åcant p ¬º .248. As can be seen in Fig. 3, although overall participants were faster when using the calculator keypad and entering tele- phone numbers, the interaction was due to the pronounced slowing that participants showed when entering numeric stimuli using the telephone layout. When using the calculator keypad, participants were on average 191 ms slower to enter numeric versus phone stimuli. In contrast, when using the telephone keypad, participants were on average 537 ms slower to enter numeric versus phone stimuli. The results thus far have focused on performance on each stimulus; that is, examining accuracy and RT for the entire 10-digit number string presented. This represents the accuracy and RTs of the total of the 10 keystrokes per stimulus presented. In the  h2  Fig. 3.

This aimed to measure the accuracy and speed of each individual keypress within each 10-digit number string. These were examined using a repeated-measures ANOVA, grouped according to its location in the top, middle, or bottom rows (Table 1).1 Looking Ô¨Årst at accuracy, the effect of Row was signiÔ¨Å- cant, F(2, 112) ¬º 46.57, p < .01, h2 p ¬º .454. For mean correct RTs, the effect of Row was signiÔ¨Åcant, F(2, 112) ¬º 39.48, p < .01, h2 p ¬º .414. Follow-up paired t-tests, using a Bonferroni-corrected (.05/ 3 ¬º .016), indicated that responses using the middle row keys were both more accurate and faster than responses using the top or bottom row keys (all p‚Äôs < .008).  a  4. Discussion  Our study was motivated by the observation that people seem to switch between tasks with relative ease on devices using numeric keypads, such as telephones and calculators, despite previously documented inaccuracy in their explicit memories for the digit layouts on the keypads. With the ever-increasing emergence of new devices, potentially with differing keypad layouts, it becomes an important issue to understand empirically how easily (or not) everyday people switch keypad layouts. Replicating Rinck (1999), we found that participants (mostly college students) were more accurate in their memory for telephone versus calculator layouts. In addition, in our study we wanted to address whether users type speciÔ¨Åc types of numeric information more accurately and more quickly using speciÔ¨Åc types of numeric keypad layouts. We found that participants were more accurate entering phone numbers no matter what the keypad layout. The phone number advantage is consistent with Marteniuk et al. (1996), but the result here cannot be solely attributed to differences in chunking, as the numeric stimuli were also presented in discrete chunks of information. Most importantly, participants‚Äô time to type in the numerical informa- tion showed an interaction of stimulus format and keypad layout: participants were speciÔ¨Åcally slowed when entering numeric stimuli using a telephone keypad layout. Increased errors and slower RTs were observed speciÔ¨Åcally for responses using the top and bottom row keys of the keypad relative to the middle row keys,  Fig. 2.

Our results suggest that, in contrast to Marteniuk et al. (1996), users show costs from entering speciÔ¨Åc types of numeric infor- mation using certain conÔ¨Ågurations of keypad layouts. In our study, the effect was observed in terms of RTs. Although the difference between entering phone and numeric stimuli on a telephone keypad was 537 ms, this difference was observed for entering a single sequence of 10 digits. If a user were to enter multiple 10-digit strings consecutively, as in the example given earlier for a phar- macy technician, that half-second difference could quickly add up and impact productivity. An example of a daily activity that epito- mizes the speciÔ¨Åcally slowed combination of entering a numeric stimulus into a telephone keypad is that of a consumer using the calculator tool on a cell phone. The current results indicate that if a user is planning to conduct numerous calculations, he or she should instead keep a pocket calculator nearby to maximize efÔ¨Åciency, or use a smartphone application with a proper calculator layout. We found that participants were faster and more accurate when using the calculator layout, whether entering phone or numeric stimuli. The speed advantage for the calculator layout observed here may have been driven by the use of a computer keyboard keypad as the response device. Participants with previous com- puter experience likely have already established the motor mem- ories that allow them to locate and type in number information on this device (Rinck and Ellwart, 2004). By switching the top and bottom rows of the keyboard keypad to create the telephone keypad layout, participants likely dealt with more motor memory interference in this condition than vice-versa. Future research using a touchtone or cell phone as the response device, and alternating the buttons as necessary to create a calculator layout, could conÔ¨Årm this idea. Our results also have implications for research studies that use existing keypad layouts for participants to enter numeric infor- mation. For example, Salvucci (2005) investigated participants‚Äô ability to multitask using a desktop computer driving simulator. While participants drove the simulator, they also entered ‚Äúfour of their most familiar 10-digit phone numbers‚Äù (p. 479) using the computer keyboard numeric keypad, which was the standard calculator layout instead of a telephone layout (D. D. Salvucci, personal communication, 5/31/13). Of note, Salvucci (2005) elimi- nated 30% of their participants from the Ô¨Ånal sample, because those 30% were too inaccurate while entering the phone numbers, indi- cating these participants may have had difÔ¨Åculty dealing with the interference caused by using a calculator keypad design to enter telephone numbers. This example illustrates a potential source of unwanted variance in participants‚Äô data, if a research study uses the keypad as the input device without taking into account differences between the positioning of keys in the telephone and calculator layouts. In addition, the observation of faster RTs for the calculator layout contradicts Conrad and Hull (1968), who strongly advocated for the use of the telephone layout for all numeric data entry. As mentioned previously, the participants in Conrad and Hull (1968)  had no experience with either touchtone telephones or calcula- tors, which may account for the differences between their results and ours. An interesting factor for future research is how changing computing technologies affect human performance. As more con- sumers opt for laptops or tablets as their main computing devices, instead of traditional desktops, it‚Äôs likely that they will have less experience with the numeric keypads present on full keyboards. Thus, it may not be useful to advocate a speciÔ¨Åc numeric keypad layout as being the best or most efÔ¨Åcient. Instead, users‚Äô perfor- mance will be determined not only by the task and layout, but also by their history of using different keypad layouts. Although our study contributes to the understanding of how keypad layout can affect accuracy and speed of numeric data entry, there are a few limitations to this study. First, it would be ideal to have a larger sample of participants. The sample size was adequate for signiÔ¨Åcance testing, and larger than previous research on this topic (e.g., Marteniuk et al., 1996), but for the sake of increased external validity, a broader age-group and/or sample with expertise using speciÔ¨Åc layouts would be interesting for future research. In particular, future work could test competing numeric keypad ar- rangements with users who have extensive practice using speciÔ¨Åc numeric keypad arrangements (e.g., accountants) to see if the same effects are obtained as in the non-expert subjects tested here. Second, a more seamless transition between keypad layouts would be valuable for testing quick transitions between keypads. This would help to examine the phenomena of task-switching versus motor memory of keypads. Because our RT measure included as- pects of both cognitive decision time and motor movement time, future work examining the effect of novel versus already known phone numbers and digit sequences could be informative. Addi- tionally, the QWERTY keyboard layout of numbers should be tested (with the number keys 1-0 all adjacent in one row), because many laptops and keyboard-free devices (e.g., touchscreen key- boards, tablets) have this layout as the only option for number entry.  5.  Conclusion  In conclusion, we found evidence that despite users‚Äô relatively inaccurate memories for the layout of a calculator, entering numeric information into a calculator keypad layout was superior to using a telephone keypad layout. In addition, although partici- pants were faster to enter phone numbers compared to other numeric stimuli on either type of layout, they were particularly slowed when entering numeric stimuli into a telephone keypad. Responses made using the middle row of keys were faster and more accurate than responses using the top and bottom row of keys, providing evidence that interference from competing mental rep- resentations affects user performance during numeric data entry. Future research should address a broader age group, and include participants with keypad expertise. As more electronic devices come onto the market and are used in number entry at various jobs where accuracy and time are critical, it becomes increasingly important to understand how these different layouts impact both accuracy and speed of number entry.

s0003687013002354,"  With the increase in the number of functions in the driving environment, icons that are compact and international (language) (Horton, 1994) are often used in a vehicle to convey information to the driver (Green, 1993). Effective icons can provide the driver with a quick and complete understanding of the information to ensure driver safety (Baber and Wankling, 1992). But designing compre- hensible icons is not a simple task. Saunby et al. (1988) showed that only 16 of 25 car icons tested could be matched correctly by a minimum 75% of experimental participants. An icon may be comprised of border, background, symbol (consisting of graphical elements), and textual labels (Fig. 1) (Campbell et al., 2004b; Horton, 1994) although not all of these components must be present. Each icon component can add meaning to an icon in its own way. Borders can make icons appear more consistent; background can help to group icons; and graph- ical and textual elements convey the main meaning of the icon (Carney et al., 1998). As indicated by Wang et al. (2007), icon taxonomy can fulÔ¨Åll a variety of functions including classifying icons into different types  * Corresponding author.

Most icon taxonomy systems were developed to classify graphical icons according to how ab- stract or concrete they are (Wang et al., 2007). For example, graphical icons can be classiÔ¨Åed into image-related (pictorial), concept-related (analogy), or arbitrary based on how far the graphical elements in an icon (Fig. 1) resemble their referents (Goonetilleke et al., 2001; Lodding, 1983). Image-related icons are typical pictorial representations of the object or action. Concept- related icons attempt to visualize a concept that is not far but separate from the concrete image. Arbitrary icons have no obvious reference to their intended meaning, but become meaningful only through convention and education (Goonetilleke et al., 2001; Lodding, 1983). However, according to Blattner et al. (1989), semi- abstract icons combine an image-related (representational) picto- rial element with an abstract (concept-related or arbitrary) symbol. For example, a folder with an arrow that indicates placing items in it. Similar semi-abstract icons can be found in cars, for example for rear window demisting and defrosting, the square depicts the rear window while the wavy arrow lines symbolize hot air Ô¨Çow. Besides graphical icons, two more categories can be added if incorporating textual elements into the icons: textual and com- bined (Reder and Mccallum, 2004). Textual icons can be further divided based on whether they contain words or abbreviations. Therefore, all icons can be classiÔ¨Åed into seven categories (image-  0003-6870/$ e see front matter √ì 2013 Elsevier Ltd and The Ergonomics Society.

Other graphical icon formats, e.g. concept- related and arbitrary, have less obvious connections with the real world, and are therefore more difÔ¨Åcult to interpret. Arbitrary icons should be avoided because educating people to associate arbitrary objects and their referents requires a considerable amount of funding and time (Horton, 1994). However, image-related (con- crete) icons are less likely to provide any functional beneÔ¨Åts for experienced users, even though they may be preferred (McDougall and Curry, 2004). The majority of above statements seem to suggest that image- related icons would be the most effective. However, if we review the commonly used ISO standard icons, we will Ô¨Ånd that not all of the icons are image-related because for some functions or contexts it is difÔ¨Åcult or impossible to Ô¨Ånd a real object to represent the referent when creating image-related icons. Besides, most previous studies only compared three types of graphical icons (Wogalter et al., 2006) or graphical versus textual icons (Baber and Wankling, 1992; Wiedenbeck, 1999). Therefore, the current study categorized 82 existing icons within a newly built vehicle into seven different icon formats and compared the comprehension performance of the participants as they responded to each of the different formats. Eighty-two icons were classiÔ¨Åed into seven major categories based on Lodding (1983), Goonetilleke et al. (2001), and Blattner et al. (1989). Previously, before the introduction of the semi- abstract category, there were inconsistencies and confusions in classifying icons that had a representational pictorial element with  Fig. 1.

Prior research has compared the advantages of each icon format. The general conclusion is that recognition of graphical images has been found to be superior than that of text for recall and recogni- tion accuracy (Paivio, 1971; Shepard, 1967), while text has been better for reaction time (Dewar et al., 1976). For graphical icons, image-related icons are easy to interpret because they have an obvious mapping between icon and the referent, thus image- related icons were considered the most effective for fast and  Fig. 2.

Most of these confusions were between image-related and concept-related; or among image-related, concept-related, and arbitrary, which could be resolved by categorizing them into the semi-abstract category. Besides, there was some confusion about classifying the car key reminder indicator ( ), as either image-related or concept-related, because of its poor image quality. Since image quality was not an attribute for the classiÔ¨Åcation of each icon format ( ) was classiÔ¨Åed as image-related. Since subjective rating scales are easy to administer, at times they can be more sensitive than objective measurements (Chi and Lin, 1998). Therefore, these 82 icons were also evaluated based on some subjective design features (McDougall and Reppa, 2008) such as familiarity, concreteness, visual complexity, and semantic dis- tance. Each will be deÔ¨Åned as in Table 1. The subjective rating features can help to explain why some icons could be better recognized than others (Liu and Ho, 2012). Among the seven differential icon formats, all four subjective design features (familiarity, concreteness, complexity, and seman- tic distance) can be used to evaluate image-related, concept- related, semi-abstract, arbitrary, and combined icons. However, for  word and abbreviation formats, besides semantic distance, partic- ipants were also asked about whether they understood the meaning of the word or abbreviation in an icon. One small Ô¨Çaw in the evaluation of subjective design features is that the text meaning of the combined icons was not measured. The education level (university education versus without) (Ng and Chan, 2007) and experience (Goonetilleke et al., 2001; Isherwood et al., 2007) of the respondents were found to have signiÔ¨Åcant effects on comprehension. Our experiment chose to test participants with at least a university-level education and divided their driving experience into having no driving experience and having intensive driving experience. Driving can be seen as a form of training that can increase icon recognition signiÔ¨Åcantly (Goonetilleke et al., 2001). The current experiment measured icon recognition using novice drivers and experienced drivers to derive the proper baseline performance and evaluate the beneÔ¨Åcial effect of experience on recognizing the different icon formats. In evaluating the comprehensibility of symbols, Wolff and Wogalter (1998) recommend using appropriate context showing the environment in which the symbol will likely be placed. Eighty- two icons copied from the steering wheel, center stack, and dash- board of a newly built vehicle would be presented on three task screens, respectively. Each task screen deals with maneuvering the vehicle, setting turning signals and activating the windshield wipers to increase driving safety, and serving the entertainment and information functions (Geiser, 1985; Tonnis et al., 2006). Icons in other locations, e.g. hood, trunk, and gas tank; were not included because it takes tremendous time to build each context and Ô¨Ånd- ings from the current three task screens can be generalized to icons in other contexts. Besides providing appropriate context, Wolff and Wogalter (1998) and SAE J2830 published by SAE International (2008) also recommended the use of an open-ended test. Since the scoring of open-ended responses is subjective and difÔ¨Åcult, and mean comprehension on multiple-choice test with plausible dis- tractors was not signiÔ¨Åcantly different from the result generated from the open-ended test (Wolff and Wogalter, 1998), the current  Fig. 3.

Participants will match each icon with the most appropriate referent name. The referent names were copied from the owner‚Äôs manual. A possible Ô¨Çaw in our matching task is that for some of the  (new) referent functions, the image is a good choice to represent the underlying function, but the referent name was poorly chosen. The subjective design features would be rated for each icon after the matching test. These 82 icons would be categorized into seven different formats (i.e., image-related, concept-related, semi- abstract, arbitrary, word, abbreviation, and combined) to compare  Fig. 5.

s0003687013002639,"  Manual material handling tasks in industry that result in lateral bending and twisting motions of the spine have been associated with the onset of low back injuries (Kelsey et al., 1984; Marras et al., 1993; Punnett et al., 1991). Twisting and lateral bending movement velocities associated with asymmetric spine motions have been identiÔ¨Åed as two of the Ô¨Åve risk factors in the Lumbar Motion Monitor risk model (Marras et al., 1993; Marras and Granata, 1995). The challenge faced by ergonomists attempting to prevent injuries in repetitive lifting tasks, that cannot be eliminated or automated, is how to control or limit the range and speed of these spine postural deviations. While spine motions and moments in the sagittal plane (forward Ô¨Çexion) can be reduced by raising lift origins and desti- nations (Davis and Marras, 2005; Lavender et al., 2003), controlling the postural deviations in the frontal plane (lateral bending) and the transverse plane (twisting) poses a greater challenge to in- dustrial ergonomists. Some would argue that the exposure to lateral bending and twisting motions could be controlled through training on better lifting techniques. Lavender et al. (1995) reported that when instructed to step during an asymmetric lifting task,  * Corresponding author. E-mail address: taehoonk@kyungnam.ac.kr (T.H. Kim).  participants signiÔ¨Åcantly reduced the amount of spine twisting and lateral bending. Unfortunately, the studies investigating the effec- tiveness of training on lifting techniques have shown few people actually adopt the techniques and there is little change in reported low back pain (Daltroy et al., 1997; Lavender et al., 2007; van Poppel et al., 1998). Alternatively, Marras and Allread (2006) advocated that asym- metric spine motions can be controlled through adjustment to workplace layout, for example, separating the lifts origin and destination. Jorgensen et al. (2005), however, reported that manipulating the transfer distance had limited effectiveness when trying to control spine kinematics. In our prior work, we found that separating the lift origin and destination by 1 m to be effective in reducing the degree to which participants twisted or laterally bent their backs (Lavender and Johnson, 2009) when lifting boxes with handles from and to conveyors 0.76 m above the Ô¨Çoor. Additionally, when transferring boxes without handles from 0.5 m, 0.9 m, and 1.3 m above the Ô¨Çoor to a conveyor 0.9 m above the Ô¨Çoor, a task similar to that experienced when de-palletizing materials, Mehta et al. (in press) reported transfer distances between 1 and 1.25 m provided a balance between several spine kinematic variables. The present study, using a similar paradigm, investigated if the re- lationships between transfer distance and spine kinematic mea- sures persist when transferring boxes without handles from near hip level to three different levels representative of a palletizing  0003-6870/$ e see front matter √ì 2013 Elsevier Ltd and The Ergonomics Society.

SpeciÔ¨Åcally, this study tested the hypotheses that (1) changing the transfer distance between a lift‚Äôs origin and destination affects the amount of twisting and lateral bending and the speed of these motions, and that (2) the relationship between the spine kine- matics and the transfer distance depends upon the height to which boxes are placed.  2. "
s0003687013002640,"  Ergonomic studies are wide-ranging, including the measure- ments, evaluations and analyses of workplaces, tools or even pro- cesses (Kaljun and Dolsak, 2012; Polajnar et al., 2012; Shuxing et al., 2008). Several authors have researched the topic of handle design in order to deÔ¨Åne the optimal size of a tool handle since a correctly designed handle can provide safety, comfort, and increased per- formance. Different authors have used different criteria for deter- mining the optimal cylindrical handle: subjective comfort ratings (Hall and Bennett, 1956; Yakou et al., 1997); Ô¨Ånger force measure- ments (Amis, 1987; Chen, 1991); muscle force minimisation (Sancho-Bru et al., 2003) and hand anthropometry (Blackwell et al., 1999; Garneau and Parkinson, 2011; Grant et al., 1992; Johnson, 1993; Oh and Radwin, 1993; Seo and Armstrong, 2008; Yakou et al., 1997). A few studies have also used two or more criteria: Ô¨Ånger force measurements and muscle activity (Ayoub and Presti, 1971; Blackwell et al., 1999; Grant et al., 1992); subjective comfort ratings, Ô¨Ånger force measurements and the electromyographic ef- Ô¨Åciency of muscle activity (Kong and Lowe, 2005).

Dolsak).  variety of criteria used for determining optimal cylindrical handles has also dictated the uses of different methods. The recommended diameters of the cylindrical handles therefore vary from 25 mm to 60 mm, and above. The mechanical behaviour of the skin and subcutaneous tissue is very important during grasping tasks as they are in direct contact and the forces and moments are transferred from the tool to the whole hand-arm system. Skin and subcutaneous tissue have non- linearly viscoelastic properties, where the skin is stiffer than the subcutaneous tissue (Wu et al., 2007). Both have low stiffness re- gions at small strains followed by a great increase in stiffness when increasing the strain. It has been shown, that higher contact pres- sures than those allowed for speciÔ¨Åc times can result in discomfort, pain, and ischemia. A power grasp produces very uneven distri- bution of forces and can yield to a contact pressure of the Ô¨Ångertip of 80 kPa, which is excessive loading for skin and subcutaneous tissue (Gurram et al., 1995; Rossi et al., 2012). It has also been shown that foam materials can effectively reduce the contact pressure (Fellows and Freivalds, 1991). The Ô¨Ånite element method has also been utilised for successfully modelling, comparing, and evaluating material choice during the design phase of a product (Novak, 2012). In our previous research we thereby investigated and proposed hyper-elastic foam materials for a tool handle based on the Ô¨Ånite element method that took into account the non-linear behaviour of  0003-6870/$ e see front matter √ì 2013 Elsevier Ltd and The Ergonomics Society.

Many powered hand tools also produce vibrations that are transferred from the handle to the hand. Deformations of skin and subcutaneous tissue whilst holding the tool and the vibration induced by the tool can lead to a disorder called ‚ÄúHand-arm vibration syndrome‚Äù that may cause vascular, sensorineural and muscosceletal disorders (Bernard et al., 1998; Youakim, 2009). It has been also shown, that objects that follow the shape of the hand result in much lower local contact pressures of the soft tissue, which can prevent discomfort and several disorders (Wu and Dong, 2005). However some authors have argued that a higher contact area can lower the subjective comfort ratings as a higher contact area triggers more pressure sensors in the soft tissue (Goonetilleke and Eng, 1994; Xiong et al., 2011). Therefore the designer has to Ô¨Ånd the optimal contact area that can increase the subjective comfort ratings, and attempt to lower the risk of hand tool related muscu- loskeletal disorders. This study only evaluated the effects of increasing the contact area between the tool handle and the hand on the subjective ratings of discomfort, and did not attempt to evaluate how increasing the contact area affects injury risks. Many researchers have paid a lot of attention to hand tools in terms of perceived discomfort. Comfort is strongly correlated to user performance and injury frequency (Kinchington et al., 2012; Kuijt-Evers et al., 2007; Mundermann et al., 2001). Subjective comfort is affected by physical, physiological, and psychological factors and is a subjectively deÔ¨Åned feeling that differs from subject to subject (De Looze et al., 2003). The uses of hand tools are mostly accompanied by feelings of discomfort that can be considered as a contradiction of comfort. Therefore designers have to optimise the size and shape of the handle in order to reduce the discomfort (Kuijt-Evers et al., 2004). The feeling of discomfort whilst using a hand tool can reduce the efÔ¨Åciency of the task and the user‚Äôs satisfaction (Fellows and Freivalds, 1991). A poorly designed tool handle can also cause cumulative trauma disorders of the hand and forearm if the task continues over a longer time period (Eksioglu, 2004). Different predictors that have an inÔ¨Çuence on subjective discomfort-comfort rating while using a hand tool have been identiÔ¨Åed in previous papers (Kuijt-Evers et al., 2004). Based on a developed taxonomy, predictors can be combined into three fac- tors: functionality, physical interaction and adverse effects on soft tissues, and lastly adverse effects on the skin (Kuijt-Evers et al., 2007). It has been shown that the functionality of a hand tool is one of the more important comfort and productivity predictors. The reduction of discomfort is mainly possible by optimisation of the functionality of the hand tool and the physical interaction between the hand and the handle. Kong et al. (2012) showed that increasing the required grip force also changes the subjective comfort rating from comfort to discomfort. The appearance of the hand tool does not make a direct contribution to the perceived discomfort but it can lead to user satisfaction whilst using the tool, and has a decisive impact on buying decisions. Therefore the designer also has to consider the aesthetics of the hand tool (Kaljun and Dolsak, 2012; Kuijt-Evers et al., 2004). As comfort ratings when using hand tools are subjectively deÔ¨Åned, it is also preferable to use subjective measurement methods such as hand tool testing of targeted populations and questionnaires, when evaluating a hand tool (Kuijt-Evers et al., 2007). Subjective methods have clear disadvantages such as time error and context effects (Annett, 2002). The time error effect can be attributed to the time between the presentation of the standard and the variable stimulus when the standard is held in memory and  the context effects account for the multidimensionality of the er- gonomics ratings. However objective methods (such as grip force and pressure measurements, electromyography, biomechanical hand models, Ô¨Ånite element analyses, etc.) can only predict the physical aspects on the perceived comfort and do not directly correlate to the subjective comfort rating value (Kuijt-Evers et al., 2007). Aldien et al. (2005) provided rough guidelines regarding pres- sure discomfort (PDT) and also pressure-pain threshold (PPT), where PPT is higher than PDT and the values differ according to the area of the hand. In addition different subjects have reported different values due to the subjective perception of the load on the hand. A PDT limit of 188 kPa was reported by Aldien et al. (2005), however Fransson-Hall and Kilbom (1993) had estimated the value to be 104 kPa. The wide-ranges of the PDT limits indicate that the connection of contact pressure on the perceived subjective comfort rating is still not clearly deÔ¨Åned. According to the Ô¨Ånite element simulations performed in by Wu and Dong (2005), it was shown that the surface curvature has a big inÔ¨Çuence on the resulting contact pressure on the Ô¨Ångertip when in contact with an object. Those objects that follow the shape of the hand and the skin‚Äôs surface result in much lower contact pressures and local deformations of the skin and subcutaneous tissue that can prevent discomfort and several disorders. Previous studies have focused on cylindrical or elliptical shapes of the handles, and have provided mathematical models for diameter determination and design recommendations, as previ- ously presented. None of them provided methods for determining the optimal shape of the handle in order to investigate its impor- tance and also to improve the handle‚Äôs ergonomics. Nevertheless some authors have argued that the handles should vary in size between the hand and Ô¨Ånger sizes, as the maximum voluntary Ô¨Ånger contraction force is diameter-dependent (Kong and Lowe, 2005). In recent papers regarding this topic authors have also proposed, that further research into this topic should consider the shape of the hand during the optimal power grasp posture, in order to evaluate the importance of the shape on perceived comfort and for optimising the shapes of the handles across different pop- ulations (Garneau and Parkinson, 2011). The lack of correct handle shape determination and optimisa- tion provides extensive room for the investigation and improve- ments in tool handle design. The aims of this study were to develop a mathematical method for customising tool handles to the shapes of particular users‚Äô hands and to compare to the shape of the users‚Äô hands with handles that were cylindrical.  2. Mathematical approach for determining customised handles‚Äô dimensions  2.1. Determination of an optimal cylindrical handle with variable diameters  According to developed hand grasp taxonomy, grasps can be divided into precision grasps and power grasps (Cutkosky, 1989; Napier, 1956). A heavy wrap power grasp was considered accord- ingly during this study as this kind of grasp is mostly used and best- suited for use with powered and non-powered hand tools, and provides maximal functionality, grip strength, and stability (Cutkosky, 1989). Some previous studies have considered anthropometric data for obtaining an optimal handle diameter (Garneau and Parkinson, 2011; Kong and Lowe, 2005; Seo and Armstrong, 2008). Therefore the obtained mathematical models could also be used for deter- mining the optimal handle diameter for a customised handle.  
G. Harih, B. Dolsak / Applied Ergonomics 45 (2014) 943e954  945  The equation for determining the optimal diameter of the handle with a single diameter from the study of Seo and Armstrong (2008) can be extended into Eq.

Therefore the control calculation of Dopt can be directly compared to the optimal handle diameters Doptj2 calculated in this study. The resulting di- ameters for cylindrical handles were almost equal despite the au- thors using different methods for diameter determination. Therefore it can be assumed that the resulting diameters have been veriÔ¨Åed.  (1)  3.

Participants were informed about the study and written consents were obtained. Afterwards anthropometric measurements of subjects‚Äô hands were performed and were used in Eqs. (1) and (2) in order to calculate the optimal diameters of the handles for each subject. The obtained results were compared to the equation for optimal handle diameter obtained by Kong and Lowe (2005).

Anatomically shaped customised handle  As no methodologies exist for the development and manufacturing of anatomically shaped customised handles, a standardised methodology was developed for obtaining anatomi- cally shaped customised handles and for evaluating and comparing them with cylindrical handles.  3.1.1. Optimal cylindrical handle with variable diameters  The calculated diameters in the previous section were used for manufacturing customised cylindrical pre-handles with variable diameters out of hard polyurethane, for each subject. Anthropo- metric measurements were performed on each subject in order to obtain the sectional size according to each Ô¨Ånger width. Manufac- tured optimal cylindrical handles with variable diameters were tested with by the corresponding subjects and it was shown that the calculated diameters were correct, as there was an overlapping of the tip of thumb with the Ô¨Ångertips of index and middle Ô¨Ångers, as calculated (Fig. 3).  3.1.2. Optimal power grasp posture Ô¨Åxation during shape acquisition  An outer hand mould was manufactured whilst softly holding the optimal cylindrical handle with variable diameters in order to maintain the diameters and the shape of the power grasp posture with non-deformed skin and subcutaneous tissue. The outer hand moulds were manufactured by two Physiotherapists at The Insti- tute of Physical and Rehabilitation Medicine, University Medical Centre Maribor. Orthotic material OrÔ¨Ålight√í (OrÔ¨Åt Industries, Belgium) was used with a thickness of 2.5 mm and micro perfo- ration that had great ability for moulding to anatomical contours. A rough shape of the extended subject‚Äôs hand was cut-out of a 45  60 cm plate. The cut-out shape was activated in a hot water bath with an ideal activation temperature of 65  C. The mould was shaped on the dorsal side of the subject‚Äôs hand when softly holding the optimal cylindrical handle with variable diameters. The hand was in a neutral position according to ergonomic recommenda- tions. The basic shape of the mould was accomplished within the activation time. After the hardening, smaller corrections were made with a hot air gun. After the shape of the mould was declared as satisfactory, straps were added for the hand and hand-opening Ô¨Åxations (Fig. 4).  4  L  3  L  L F|T  1  L  2  L  3.1.3. Magnetic Resonance Imaging  Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) was performed at the Radiological Department of the University Medical Centre Maribor. The MRI machine was a GE medical systems Signa HDxt 3.0T. The subjects scanning position was HFDR (Head First-Decubitus Right) with the extended hand (Fig. 5). The used coil was a one channel HD Knee/Foot Coil that allowed the best positioning of the hand during the scanning. Before the scanning, an optimal cylindrical handle with variable diameters was used to Ô¨Ånely adjust to the correct size of the outer hand mould for each subject. The optimal cylindrical handle with variable diameters was removed during the scanning in order to obtain the shape of the non-deformed skin and  Fig. 1.

The outer mould and the hand were Ô¨Åxed with foam, which prevented any movement of the hand during scanning (Fig. 5). The slice thickness was set at 1 mm to avoid unnecessarily small anatomical structures and surface details. The scanning time was about 15 min. Every subject was told to hold his/ her hand in an open position touching the mould during the scanning in order to maintain the proper diameters and shape of an optimal power grasp. The scanned images were provided in the DICOM format.  3.1.4.  Segmentation and 3D reconstruction  imaging and editing software Amira√í A professional medical 5.3.3 (Visage Imaging) was used for the segmentation and 3D re- constructions of the DICOM images. Segmentation was performed using a threshold technique as only the surface of the hand was needed and no differentiation in anatomical structure of the hand was necessary. Preliminary 3D reconstructions showed that the model was anatomically accurate and the produced outer surface highly detailed. In order to obtain a smoother surface a ‚Äúresample‚Äù module was added to the segmentation and the 3D reconstruction process. The result was a smooth 3D representation of the subject‚Äôs hand in power grasp posture (Fig. 6).  3.1.5.  Anatomically shaped customised tool handle  The .STL Ô¨Åle for each subject obtained in Amira√í software was imported into commercial CAD software CATIA√í V5R20. A mathe- matically deÔ¨Åned surface model was generated within a Surface  reconstruction module. The surface model was then converted into a mathematically deÔ¨Åned volumetric model using a Close Surface tool in the Part Design module. An elliptical cylinder was modelled in order to obtain the customised shaped handle for power grasp posture. The size and the position of the cylinder were determined so that the cylinder fully overlapped the palmar empty volume created by the hand during the optimal power grasp posture (Fig. 7). In order to obtain the customised handle, the Boolean operation ‚ÄúRemove‚Äù was used that removed the cylinder model volume, which was in overlap with the hand model volume. Despite resampling during the 3D reconstruction, the resulting handle was full of small surface details that were the result of the surface de- tails of the scanned hand. These anatomical details were so small that their contribution to handle comfort and contact area was assumed to be negligible. Therefore it was, from in regard to manufacturing and aesthetic considerations, reasonable to add additional smoothing to the 3D reconstructed hand in order to obtain a smoother and aesthetically more appealing handle. Addi- tionally the sharp edges were rounded to avoid any chances of injury (Fig. 8). In order to compare and evaluate the anatomically shaped customised handle with the cylindrical handle, the customised handles were manufactured using a rapid prototyping technique.  3.2.  Subjective comfort ratings  3.2.1.  Subjects and task description  The subjects were each provided with an informed consent form and a description of the measurements procedure. They were told to stand comfortably with their elbows at ninety degrees and wrists  Fig. 3. Testing the optimal cylindrical handle with variable diameters.  Fig. 4.

They were asked to perform the task of grip- ping the handle with their preferred normal grip force whilst applying a push force of 50 N on the handle, which was mounted onto a force gauge. In this way standardised and more generalised simulations of a common task were performed using hand tools. This was assumed as most tasks that require power or pistol grip produce normal forces on the hand‚Äôs surface. The same task was also performed by each subject with a corresponding cylindrical handle. The utilised general task provided exactly the same task for each subject. Based on this generalised task each subject corre- sponded to his/her distinctive physiological response and subjec- tive rating of the handle, and was therefore task independent. The major limitation of the generalised task was its generality, which did not consider the use of the handle on real tools and real tasks.  Fig. 6. Obtained 3D hand in Amira√í in optimal power grasp posture.  3.2.2.  Subjective ratings questionnaire and data acquisition  In order to compare and evaluate the newly-developed and manufactured customised shaped handles and the circular handles, a questionnaire was adapted containing a variety of questions relating to handle comfort and performance, based on the paper of Kuijt-Evers et al. (2007) (Table 1). The subjects rated the handle comfort descriptors on a scale containing 7 discrete levels (from 1 ¬º totally disagree to 7 ¬º totally agree) (Kuijt-Evers et al., 2007). In order to evaluate the different areas of the handle, we extended the subjective comfort rating questionnaire to include comfort e discomfort predictors for six distinctive anatomical areas of the hand: the thumb, the index, middle, ring and little Ô¨Ångers, and the palm, in order to evaluate the subjective comfort ratings (Table 2). The overall subjective comfort subjects (Table 3). After the data had been collated it was edited and the mean values of the standard deviations were calculated in order to evaluate and discuss the results.  ratings were evaluated by the  4. Results  4.1. Method veriÔ¨Åcation and the objective measurements  Additional objective measurements were also considered for verifying the proposed methods of obtaining the customised sha- ped handle and for evaluating and comparing both handles. Virtual measurements on the obtained customised shaped handles in CATIA√í showed that the optimal diameters for each handle were withheld by the outer hand mould during the MRI within small deviations, therefore it could be assumed that the subject‚Äôs hand was in its optimal power grasp posture. In order to compare the contact area between the customised shaped handles obtained during this study and the corresponding cylindrical handles of optimal diameters, the cylindrical handles corresponding to each subject were manufactured using hard plastics. The diameters of the cylindrical handles were determined

The measured mean contact area of the customised handles was, on average, over 25% higher than for the optimal cylindrical handles.  4.2. Overall handle subjective comfort predictors rating  Firstly, the overall handle subjective comfort predictor rating questionnaire was evaluated (Fig. 9). In order to determine whether there were statistically signiÔ¨Åcant differences between both han- dles, we utilised a dependent samples T-test. The results also showed high values for standard deviations. This was expected as  Fig. 8.

Comfort descriptors ‚ÄòFits the hand‚Äô, ‚ÄòIs easy in use‚Äô and ‚ÄòOffers a nice grip feeling‚Äô were statistically signiÔ¨Åcant different at p < .05 and were rated higher for the customised shaped handle than for the cylindrical handle. The ‚ÄòHas a good force and moment trans- mission‚Äô, ‚ÄòIs a high quality handle‚Äô, ‚ÄòOffers a high task performance‚Äô, ‚ÄòIt provides high quality of the total product‚Äô, ‚ÄòLooks professional‚Äô, ‚ÄòNeeds low hand grip force supply for stable grip‚Äô and ‚ÄòHas good friction between handle and hand‚Äô comfort predictors were sta- tistically signiÔ¨Åcant different at p < .01 and were rated higher for the customised shaped handles. The results showed that other comfort predictors were statistically not different.  4.3. Handle subjective comfort predictor ratings for distinctive anatomical areas  The inÔ¨Çuence of the handle shape on the overall subjective comfort ratings was additionally compared when evaluating the comfort predictors for both handles regarding the distinctive areas of the thumb, the index, middle, ring and little Ô¨Ångers, and the palm. The results showed that only one comfort predictor (‚ÄòCauses blisters in the area‚Äô) was statistically different at p < .05 (Fig. 10). For the anatomical area of the index Ô¨Ånger, the results showed statistically signiÔ¨Åcant difference at p < .05 for the comfort pre- dictors ‚ÄòCauses peak pressures on the area‚Äô, ‚ÄòCauses blisters in the area‚Äô and ‚ÄòCauses numbness and lack of tactile feeling in the area‚Äô (Fig. 11). The anatomical area of the middle Ô¨Ånger showed that there were statistically signiÔ¨Åcant differences at p < .05 in the comfort predictors ‚ÄòArea offers nice grip feeling‚Äô, ‚ÄòCauses inÔ¨Çamed skin on the area‚Äô and ‚ÄòCauses cramped muscles in the area‚Äô. There were statistically signiÔ¨Åcant differences at ‚Äò<.01 for the comfort pre- dictors ‚ÄòCauses peak pressures on the area‚Äô. Amongst all the sta- tistically different comfort predictors, the customised handle was rated better than the cylindrical handle (Fig. 12).

For the anatomical area of the little Ô¨Ånger, the results showed statistically signiÔ¨Åcant differences at p < .05 for all the measured comfort predictors (Fig 14). The Ô¨Ånal measured anatomical area was the hand palm. The results showed statistically signiÔ¨Åcant differences at p < .01 for comfort predictors ‚ÄòCauses an inÔ¨Çamed skin on the area‚Äô and ‚ÄòCauses blisters in the area‚Äô. All other comfort predictors were sta- tistically signiÔ¨Åcant different at p < .05.  4.4. Overall handle subjective comfort ratings  Finally the overall comfort was evaluated. The results from the questionnaire showed statistically signiÔ¨Åcant difference between  both handles at p<.01. The customised handle was rated at 5.2 and the cylindrical handle was 3.4 (Fig. 16).  5. Discussion  5.1. Method veriÔ¨Åcation and objective measurements  As the optimal diameters for each Ô¨Ånger were withheld by the customised tool handle, the voluntary contraction force was thereby maximised, which increased the user performance whilst using the tool with the customised handle (Seo and Armstrong, 2008). The subjective comfort ratings, which were based on the subjects‚Äô preferences regarding grip diameter sizes, were also increased, as there are small deviations according to the study from Kong and Lowe (2005). The increase in the contact area was expected as the optimal shaped handle follows the anatomical shape of the hand in its optimal power grasp posture. Therefore the contact area is also maximised. According to Seo and Armstrong (2008) the greatest contact area in their study was obtained with diameters of 51 mm and 58 mm for cylindrical handles, which contradicts the optimal diameters for maximising the voluntary contraction force and  
950  G. Harih, B. Dolsak / Applied Ergonomics 45 (2014) 943e954  Fig. 10. Handle subjective comfort predictors for the thumb area.  Higher ratings for the comfort descriptors ‚ÄòFits the hand‚Äô and ‚ÄòOffers a nice grip feeling‚Äô of the customised handle can be explained by its anatomical shape, because it considers the optimal power grasp posture and thereby provides best Ô¨Åt for the targeted subject. As the functionality of the handle adds to the whole product‚Äôs functionality, it is also one of the more important comfort predictors. This is evident with good correspondence when comparing the ‚ÄòIs functional‚Äô comfort predictor with the ‚ÄòOverall comfort‚Äô of the handle: the functionality of the cylindrical handle was rated at 3.7, whilst the customised handle was rated at 5.4 and the overall comfort of the cylindrical handle at 3.4, whilst the customised handle was rated at 5.2. The comfort predictor ‚ÄòIs easy in use‚Äô is statistically signiÔ¨Åcant different between both handles despite a lower value being expected for the anatomically shaped handle, as it provides only one feasible grasp position, whilst the cylindrical provides several due to its axle symmetry. In order to provide stability whilst holding the cylindrical handle, the exerted normal Ô¨Ånger force has to be reasonably high to  Fig. 9. Overall handle subjective comfort predictors rating.  subjective comfort maximisation, thus suggesting smaller di- ameters. Therefore it is obvious that contact area maximisation is impossible with cylindrical handles when considering the optimal diameter for maximising voluntary contraction and comfort rat- ings. Therefore, it has been shown that contact area maximisation is only possible when considering the anatomical shape of the hand in its optimal power grasp posture. Having the anatomical shape of the handle and also therefore greater contact area, high overall and local contact pressure can be avoided. Thus the shape of the handle obtained in this study is more likely to prevent cumulative trauma disorders that are pressure induced and can provide greater com- fort ratings than a cylindrical handle. In order to prove this, the results from the extensive subjective comfort ratings questionnaire are evaluated and discussed in following sub-sections.  5.2. Overall handle subjective comfort predictor ratings  Based on the obtained results from the subjective comfort rat- ings questionnaire we Ô¨Årstly discuss the overall handle subjective comfort predictors rating and compare both handles.  Fig. 11. Handle subjective comfort predictors for the index Ô¨Ånger area.  
G. Harih, B. Dolsak / Applied Ergonomics 45 (2014) 943e954  951  Fig. 12. Handle subjective comfort predictors for the middle Ô¨Ånger area.  Fig. 14. Handle subjective comfort predictors for the little Ô¨Ånger area.  prevent slippage and rotation in the direction of the handle axis. With high exerted normal forces, high local and overall contact pressures occur, which can cause discomfort and also task-related disorders (i.e. blisters, inÔ¨Çamed skin, cramped muscles.). There- fore handle slippage and rotation should be prevented by an appropriate shape of the handle. When using the customised handle obtained in this study, the stability of the tool is greatly increased as the majority of the forces and moments are transferred over the anatomical handle shape and much less by the friction between the handle and the hand. Therefore a lower normal grip force can be exerted in comparison with the cylindrical handle and the tool can be held stable in the hand. This is clearly evident from the comfort predictors ‚ÄòHas a good force and moment transmission‚Äô and ‚ÄòNeeds a low grip force for stable grip‚Äô, which were rated better for the customised shaped tool handles. In the comfort predictor ‚ÄòHas a good friction between handle and hand‚Äô it is evident that the subjects referred to friction that is caused by the forms of the handles and not the material friction between the hand and the handle. In order to measure the  material friction, the questionnaire should be appropriately revised. Subjective comfort ratings that describe the handle quality (‚ÄòIs a high quality handle‚Äô, ‚ÄòIt provides high quality to the whole product‚Äô) and visually (‚ÄòLooks professional‚Äô) were rated better for the customised handle. This can be explained by past user experi- ences and expectations as hand tools, and therefore also handles with good Ô¨Åt to the user, have higher functionality and also performance. The comfort predictor ‚ÄòOffers a high task performance‚Äô is based only on user expectations as the generalised task did not consider the measurements of productivity. More precise results could be obtained with the usages of both handles on actual hand tools, although the generality would be thereby lost. As locally badly designed handles that affect only one anatomical area can cause a lower value for the overall comfort rating, it can be assumed that this would be the case for the comfort predictors ‚ÄòCauses an inÔ¨Çamed skin of the hand‚Äô and ‚ÄòCauses peak pressures on the hand‚Äô. Based only on the overall handle subjective comfort predictors, by using the questionnaire it is impossible to determine whether the  Fig. 13. Handle subjective comfort predictors for the ring Ô¨Ånger area.  Fig. 15. Handle subjective comfort predictors for the hand palm area.  
952  G. Harih, B. Dolsak / Applied Ergonomics 45 (2014) 943e954  hand‚Äô, as all these comfort predictors are statistically not signiÔ¨Åcant different between both handles. Visual inspection of the handle showed that the higher ratings were due to the deep thumb grooves on the customised handles (Fig. 17). When applying higher grip force, the relative position of the thumb changes slightly that causes rubbing of the skin and higher local contact pressures within that area. The same effect was reported by the test subjects whilst interviewing them after performing the measurements. In this study the used handle material was hard plastic, which additionally revealed the design Ô¨Çaws of the handles and therefore higher impact on the perceived subjective comfort ratings. Therefore the actual tool handle should have a softer cover material such as rubber to avoid high local contact pressures and thereby provide increased subjective comfort ratings. Therefore this area should be redesigned in the form of a smaller groove for improving the comfort predictor rating for the anatomically shaped customised handle. Therefore more accurate results on the inÔ¨Çuence of the handle shape on the overall handle comfort could also be obtained in the future. The advantage of correct handle shape determination can be seen from the subjective comfort predictors for all the distinctive anatomical areas when evaluating and comparing both handles. In regard to the cylindrical handle the diameter is determined and therefore also optimised based only on the length of one Ô¨Ånger. This is usually the index or the middle Ô¨Ånger that make the greater contribution to the subject‚Äôs maximum voluntary contraction force. Therefore the cylindrical handle design does not allow diameter optimisation for all the Ô¨Ångers. This is only possible with correct handle shape as the diameters for each Ô¨Ånger are optimised based on the optimal power grasp posture. For the index Ô¨Ånger both handles have almost the same sub- jective comfort predictors ratings for ‚ÄòAnatomical part Ô¨Åts the area‚Äô and ‚ÄòArea offers nice grip feeling‚Äô and are statistically not signiÔ¨Åcant different (Fig. 11). This was expected as the diameter of the cylin- drical handle is the same as the diameter of the customised shaped handle and therefore provides almost the same grip quality. The deviation from the optimal diameter for the middle Ô¨Ånger regarding the cylindrical handle can be seen from the lower sub- jective comfort ratings for both comfort predictors (Fig. 12). The deviation is even higher for the ring and little Ô¨Ångers and thereby also the corresponding two subjective comfort predictors respec- tively (Figs. 13 and 14).  Fig. 16. Overall subjective comfort ratings for both handles.  whole handle causes the higher contact pressure or just one anatomical part. Therefore the results from handle subjective comfort predictor ratings for distinctive anatomical areas are evaluated in next sub-section. It can be assumed that the same effect could be attributed to the result from the comfort predictors ‚ÄòCauses blisters‚Äô as both comfort predictors are usually correlated. The comfort predictors ‚ÄòFeels clammy‚Äô in this study can be considered as a control question for verifying whether the subjects took the measurements and questionnaires seriously as both han- dles were made out of the same material with almost the same surface Ô¨Ånish. The results show that the subjects rated both handles with exactly the same rating and the T-test revealed there was no statistically signiÔ¨Åcant difference between both handles. It can therefore be assumed that the subjects took the measurements and questionnaires seriously and the results represent their subjective comfort ratings. No signiÔ¨Åcant differences were observed for the comfort pre- dictors ‚ÄòCauses numbness and lack of tactile feeling‚Äô and ‚ÄòCauses cramped muscles‚Äô. This can be attributed to the same effect of badly designed anatomical areas of the handle. The cause of numbness and lack of tactile feeling usually occurs when high contact pres- sure on a nerve is present or high contact pressure prevents the blood Ô¨Çow in the underlying soft tissue, which can cause ischemia.  5.3. Handle subjective comfort predictors ratings for distinctive anatomical areas  The results show that the thumb was the area that caused lower comfort ratings for the customised handle for the comfort pre- dictors ‚ÄòCauses an inÔ¨Çamed skin‚Äô and ‚ÄòCauses peak pressures on the  Fig. 17.

G. Harih, B. Dolsak / Applied Ergonomics 45 (2014) 943e954  953  The customised handle subjective comfort predictors ‚ÄòAnatom- ical part Ô¨Åts the area‚Äô and ‚ÄòArea offers nice grip feeling‚Äô have almost the same ratings for all the Ô¨Ångers, which indicate that the grip quality is the same for all the Ô¨Ångers. This can be attributed to the anatomical shape determination of the customised handle. How- ever both comfort predictors did not exceed a comfort rating of 5.7 on the scale. Based on previous research this effect can be most likely explained by the psychological effects of user experiences and expectations. Most of the subjects namely thought that from past experiences there are still improvement potentials possible for tool handles and reÔ¨Çected this in their subjective comfort ratings, as using a tool handle is mostly accompanied by feelings of discomfort. Other subjective comfort ratings predictors which were nega- tive correlated with the perceived comfort (‚ÄòCauses an inÔ¨Çamed skin on the area‚Äô, ‚ÄòCauses peak pressures on the area‚Äô, ‚ÄòCauses blisters in the area‚Äô, ‚ÄòCauses numbness and lack of tactile feeling on the area‚Äô, ‚ÄòCauses cramped muscles on the area‚Äô) are consistent and considerably lower rated for the customised shaped tool handle. This can be explained by the anatomical shape of the customised handle that provides the best Ô¨Åt to the subject. The middle Ô¨Ånger has, according to previous research, the sec- ond largest impact on the overall perceived comfort after the palm, therefore it is necessary to pay special attention to this area in order to increase the overall perceived comfort. Based on the results, the anatomically shaped customised handle provided higher ratings of subjective comfort predictors (Fig. 12). The ring and little Ô¨Ångers provide a lower contribution to the total maximum voluntary contraction respectively. Therefore many authors do not pay attention to the correct diameter and shape when determining these areas. However, the results show that with an anatomical shape for each corresponding area, the subjective comfort ratings can be increased (Figs. 13 and 14). Those anatomical shaped areas and optimal diameters that maximise voluntary contraction also increase the stability of the handle in the hand. Every subjective comfort rating‚Äôs predictor is statistically signiÔ¨Åcant different between both handles for the ring and little Ô¨Ångers. It has been previously shown that the greatest impact on the overall perceived subjective comfort has the anatomical area of the palm. The customised handle was rated better for all the subjective comfort predictors that were statistically signiÔ¨Åcant different be- tween both handles (Fig. 15). The ratings for the subjective comfort predictors ‚ÄòAnatomical part Ô¨Åts the area‚Äô and ‚ÄòArea offers nice grip feeling‚Äô were almost the same as for the ratings of the Ô¨Ångers. Therefore it can be assumed that the anatomically shaped custom- ised handle provides almost the same grip quality for the palm as with the Ô¨Ångers. All other subjective comfort predictors that were negatively correlated with the overall comfort were considerably lower for the customised handle compared to the cylindrical handle.  5.4. Overall handle subjective comfort ratings  Based on the results of the overall handle subjective comfort predictor ratings and the Handle subjective comfort predictor rat- ings of distinctive anatomical areas it was expected that the cus- tomised handle would be rated as more comfortable than the cylindrical handle. The customised handle was rated 5.2, whilst the cylindrical handle was rated 3.4. Therefore the anatomically shaped customised handle can be considered as more comfortable in comparison with the cylindrical handle. An improved design of the thumb groove of the customised shaped handle could additionally improve the subjective comfort predictors in comparison with the cylindrical handle, which could lead to higher overall handle sub- jective comfort ratings of the anatomically shaped customised handle.  The limitation of this study was the relatively small sample size; nevertheless the t-tests showed statistical signiÔ¨Åcances at p-values of .05 or even .01. More accurate results could also be obtained with larger subject samples. Another limitation was also the generalised measurements procedure that did not consider the use of the handle on real tools and tasks. Future research should consider real conditions, as the comfort rating can vary based on the speciÔ¨Åc task, which is dictated based on the used hand tool. Besides the optimal cylindrical handles, other more common shapes of the handles could be considered during the evaluation and analyses. Based on the desired task and hand tool, recommendations regarding the shape of the handle could be investigated and provided to the designers. A symmetrical and topologically generalised handle could be developed based on the customised handle for use over a broader variety of tasks and also targeted populations. Although user comfort is mostly evaluated using subjective questionnaires, objective measurements (e.g. muscle activity, contact pressure mapping, Ô¨Ånger grip force distribution, maximum grip force, hand- wrist postures) could be performed and analysed in the future, as they could provide the physiological effects and predict the comfort rating and initiators of cumulative trauma disorders. Therefore, the relationship between the subjective comfort ratings and the objective measurements could be compared and assessed.  6.  Conclusion  The optimal power grasp posture of the anatomically shaped customised handle provides optimal diameters for each Ô¨Ånger where the maximum voluntary contraction can be achieved. This is impossible when using the cylindrical handle as it takes into account only one Ô¨Ånger during the optimal diameter determina- tion. It has been shown that the shape of the handle has signiÔ¨Å- cant impact on the subjective comfort ratings as the anatomically shaped customised tool handles were rated considerably higher than the cylindrical handles. The ratings of subjective comfort predictors showed that the customised handles were better rated for functionality, which is one of the more important comfort predictors. Anatomically shaped handles were also better rated for subjective comfort predictors ‚ÄòFits the hand/area‚Äô and pre- dictors regarding stability, quality and visual appearance. Based on the subjective comfort predictor ratings for the distinctive anatomical areas it was shown that the customised handles that consider the optimal power grasp posture provided high comfort rating and therefore high grip quality for all distinctive anatom- ical areas. With the cylindrical handle optimisation for all distinctive anatomical areas is impossible due to the cylindrical handle being optimised for only one optimal diameter. The anatomically shaped custom handles that provide the best Ô¨Åts for targeted subjects can improve their subjective comfort ratings but however over-differentiated shaped handles can cause discom- fort. The results also showed that a badly-shaped handle area can have great impact on the overall comfort rating of the handle. Therefore correct handle shape determination can improve sub- jective comfort ratings for a targeted subject, which can increase user performance and lower the chances for fatigue or injuries. The aim of this research was to investigate the importance of correct handle shape determination, which can improve the handle‚Äôs ergonomics and therefore create added-value to the product and increase the value and competitiveness of the product on the market. Therefore researchers should also pay attention, beside the handle diameter optimisation, to correct handle shape determination in order to improve handle ergo- nomics. This study provides a base for further research, which could investigate the optimal shape determination of the handle for broader targeted populations.

s0003687013002652,"  Major accident investigations show that senior managers have a particular inÔ¨Çuence on organisational safety (e.g. Baker, 2007; National Commission on the BP Deepwater Horizon oil spill, 2011). This paper presents two studies carried out in European air trafÔ¨Åc management (ATM), which has a good safety record, but nevertheless suffered a major accident (mid-air collision) with 71 fatalities near √úberlingen in Germany in 2002. The investigators describe the way senior management deals with safety issues as related to the occurrence of such accidents:  ‚Äú[.], managers can change and improve existing corporate cul- ture by establishing safety e recognisable for all staff members e as high priority. Feedback and continual reinforcement from the most senior management down will help develop dedication and accountability that is desirable.‚Äù (p. 90; BFU, 2004).  Senior positions in organisations differ from lower levels (Hambrick, 1989). Senior managers can inÔ¨Çuence up to 45% of or- ganisations‚Äô performance (Day and Lord, 1988) and have a distinct inÔ¨Çuence on organisational safety (Clarke, 1999).

E-mail address:  safety climate literature (Flin et al., 2000; Guldenmund, 2007) identiÔ¨Åed management‚Äôs attitudes and behaviours as a predomi- nant safety climate factor. Two more recent meta-analyses (Beus et al., 2010; Christian et al., 2009) identiÔ¨Åed perceptions of man- agement safety commitment as one of the most inÔ¨Çuential safety climate components in relation to organisational safety perfor- mance. While these reviews and meta-analyses suggest that senior managers are central for organisational safety, studies involving senior managers are scarce (Flin, 2003). As a consequence it is unclear which personal attributes support their inÔ¨Çuence on safety. In this paper, we examine senior managers‚Äô characteristics through the concept of ‚Äòsafety intelligence‚Äô. The strategic leadership literature describes senior managers‚Äô understanding of business issues and their ability to develop policies as ‚Äòstrategic intelligence‚Äô (e.g. Yukl, 2001). Accordingly, we use the term ‚Äòsafety intelligence‚Äô as a concept that captures senior managers‚Äô understanding of safety issues and knowledge relevant to their policy-making in relation to safety (Kirwan, 2008). Zohar (2008) suggests that the ways in which senior managers develop and enact their policies are central to their inÔ¨Çuence on safety and their policy-making has been found to signiÔ¨Åcantly contribute to employee safety climate perceptions and safety performance (Cohen, 1977; DeJoy et al., 2004). The aim of the two studies reported in this paper is to identify the personal characteristics that support senior managers‚Äô ability to intelligently manage their organisations‚Äô safety, i.e. to make and enact policies that will have a positive effect on safety. Leadership is mostly conceptualised through interpersonal leadership  0003-6870/$ e see front matter √ì 2013 Elsevier Ltd and The Ergonomics Society.

Fruhen et al.  / Applied Ergonomics 45 (2014) 967e975  behaviours with a focus on the relationships that a manager or supervisor establishes with his or her subordinates (Zaccaro and Horn, 2003), and that is also the dominant approach in studies on leadership and safety (e.g. Clarke, 2013). However, in this study, we focus on traits and skills that can support senior managers in having a positive inÔ¨Çuence on safety, based on the following rationale. According to Zaccaro (2001), senior managers operate at a system wide level and do not have much opportunity to establish such interpersonal relations with members of their organisation. Therefore, interpersonal leadership theories are unlikely to cover all relevant aspects of senior level inÔ¨Çuence. Our approach follows the tradition of Hambrick and Mason‚Äôs (1984) upper echelons theory and considers personal characteristics to be relevant for senior managers‚Äô inÔ¨Çuence on safety. Traits (personality & moti- vation), skills (social competence & problem-solving) and knowl- edge have been proposed as inÔ¨Çuencing leader performance (Mumford et al., 2000) and as particularly relevant for strategic management (e.g. Day and Lord, 1988; Hambrick and Mason, 1984). Studies concerned with senior managers‚Äô inÔ¨Çuence on organisa- tional attributes have focussed on their personal characteristics. For example, Huffman and Hegarty (1993) found senior managers‚Äô externally oriented expertise and their planning and control abili- ties to largely inÔ¨Çuence innovations in organisations. Berson et al. (2008) found CEO values, such as benevolence, security and self- direction, to inÔ¨Çuence attributes of organisational culture, such as bureaucratic, innovative and supportive culture. Other studies report CEOs‚Äô personality (particularly need for achievement) as impacting organisational culture, strategy and structure via the rationality in their strategy making (Miller and Dr√∂ge, 1986; Miller et al., 1988; Miller and Toulouse, 1986). The investigation of senior managers‚Äô inÔ¨Çuence on organisa- tional safety presented in this paper represents an aspect of mac- roergonomics, i.e. the analysis and design of work systems, which also include organisations. Hendrick (2002) describes this ergo- nomics discipline as overlapping with organisational psychology and this is also the case for this paper. Consequently, our study sits on the overlapping fringes of ergonomics and organisational psy- chology in that it addresses a group that crucially shapes macro- level work systems (i.e. organisations) and investigates this issue via psychological characteristics of senior managers. We investigate this issue in air trafÔ¨Åc management (ATM), an industry that majorly contributes to airspace safety (EUROCONTROL, 2005). ATM organizes trafÔ¨Åc Ô¨Çow and helps to prevent the collision of aircraft (Federal Aviation Administration, Air TrafÔ¨Åc Organization Policy; February, 2010). ATM‚Äôs services involve balancing safety against other pressures such as trafÔ¨Åc throughput, providing short cuts in the airspace, safety beneÔ¨Åts and economic costs of a new technological investment (e.g. radar sys- tem), or Ô¨Çight level request from pilots in order to reduce the air- lines‚Äô fuel costs. Findings obtained in this highly reliable industry might be transferable to others and can promote cross-industry learning. The following section introduces the Ô¨Åve characteristics (traits, skills and knowledge) we suggest as relevant for senior managers‚Äô safety intelligence.  1.1.  Traits: personality and motivation  We propose the Big Five personality factors (Costa and McCrae, 1992) to support senior managers‚Äô ability to develop effective strategic safety policies and to enact them. For example, a senior manager who is highly extraverted may communicate his or her safety policies more forcefully. A more agreeable senior manager may be able to create a greater sense of trust, which can be posi- tively related to safety (Clarke and Robertson, 2005) and can help them to enact the safety policies convincingly. According to  Peterson et al. (2003), conscientious senior managers are more likely to be task focused, and thus may develop safety related policies more cautiously. A senior manager who is low on emotional stability may be less effective in actively and safely controlling stressful situations (Clarke and Robertson, 2005) and this might affect his or her capability to develop effective safety policies. Senior managers‚Äô openness to experience may support them in being more receptive to learning (Clarke and Robertson, 2005), helping them to develop a broader range of safety knowl- edge and consequently devise better safety policies. In addition, a motivational trait conceptualised as regulatory focus (Crowe and Higgins, 1997) that has previously been applied to safety (Wallace and Chen, 2006), might inÔ¨Çuence senior managers‚Äô safety policy-making. Motivational traits have been found to relate to senior managers‚Äô impact on other organisational outcomes (e.g. structure; Miller and Dr√∂ge, 1986). Regulatory focus describes in- dividuals to be motivated towards a goal via a pronounced pro- motion and prevention focus. Promotion focus leads individuals to follow an eagerness strategy and a desire to complete tasks quickly. A pronounced prevention focus leads individuals to follow a vigi- lance strategy and avoid negative outcomes (Wallace et al., 2008), thus avoiding risks when developing and communicating safety policies. Accordingly, a prominent prevention focus may support senior managers‚Äô safety intelligence. This can arise through two mechanisms: Ô¨Årst, more prevention focussed managers might pay more attention to detail and spend more time on safety issues. Time is usually a limited resource for senior managers and the amount of time they spend on safety issues has been described as conveying their personal value for safety (Flin, 2003). Secondly, a more pro- nounced prevention focus might support managers to prioritise safety issues in their policies and communication with the workforce.  1.2.  Skills: problem-solving and social competence  Management‚Äôs approach towards safety related problems can function as a frame of reference for the workforce and can reÔ¨Çect senior managers‚Äô commitment to safety (Zohar and Luria, 2005). We suggest that creative problem-solving (Isaksen and TrefÔ¨Ånger, 2004; i.e. investigation of problems, idea generation, planning ability) supports senior managers‚Äô safety intelligence as it ulti- mately contributes to the ways in which managers devise safety policies. Because the way senior managers solve problems shapes organisations and work conditions (e.g. equipment, stafÔ¨Ång level), this can also have an immediate effect on the perceived status of safety in organisations. Personable communication of senior managers with the work- force is frequently emphasised as relevant to conveying their safety messages (e.g. Harper et al., 1996; Hopkins, 2011). A recent study involving senior managers has investigated their language as a leadership tool through which they might inÔ¨Çuence organisational safety culture (Fruhen et al., 2013a). Accordingly, social competence (Baron and Markman, 2000; i.e. their ability to interact with others effectively through for example perception of others intentions, persuasion) can contribute to senior managers‚Äô ability to commu- nicate about safety with subordinates and support the ways in which they enact safety policies.  1.3. Knowledge  Finally, safety knowledge may also contribute to senior man- agers‚Äô safety intelligence. Knowledge has been described as one of the main tenets of senior managerial power (Finkelstein, 1992) and has been reported to relate to safety performance at other levels of the organisation (e.g. GrifÔ¨Ån and Neal, 2000). Safety knowledge can enable senior managers to understand safety related information  
L.S. Fruhen et al.  / Applied Ergonomics 45 (2014) 967e975  969  and to draw meaningful conclusions from it and in doing so, affect their ability to develop effective safety policies. In this paper, we empirically identify the role of these character- istics for senior managers‚Äô safety intelligence in two studies. The Ô¨Årst study focuses on CEOs, the most senior managers in organisations. Using a questionnaire, it investigates whether their direct reports view certain characteristics as desirable for CEOs‚Äô inÔ¨Çuence on safety. The second study is an interview study involving a small sample of CEO‚Äôs and other senior managers and investigates the role of the charac- teristics in their actual work on safety. The results should enable in- sights into the relevance of these characteristics that can be important for the selection, education and training of senior managers.  2.  Study 1  2.1. Method  2.1.1.  Sample  The sample consisted of 76 senior managers (Safety Directors and Managers), who all worked in European air trafÔ¨Åc management (ATM) in positions that required them to interact frequently with the CEO of their organisation (the majority reported to meet the CEO on a daily basis). On average, participants had been in their position for 6 years (range 6 monthse20 years) and the majority had backgrounds in ATM or engineering. We did not ask for more demographic in- formation in order to maintain participants‚Äô anonymity, as they were asked to provide information regarding their superiors. ATM is provided by organisations (public and private) called Air Navigation Service Providers (ANSPs) whose employees guide air- planes at airports and en-route to avoid trafÔ¨Åc conÔ¨Çicts and ensure safety and efÔ¨Åciency. Safety Directors and Managers working for an ANSP play a key role in managing air trafÔ¨Åc safety, as they are the most senior safety persons in these organisations. They are responsible for the Safety Management System (SMS) of the orga- nisation, must liaise with safety regulatory authorities, are required to work with other Directors/Managers (e.g. Operations, Human Resources, Engineering, or Finance) to keep the Executive Board aware of key safety risks and trends and are responsible for safety training and safety surveys. In the event of an accident, the Safety Manager/Director will be at the front line, working with legal counsel to liaise with the external investigation body. We did not have access to a sample of CEOs but evaluated this sample of safety directors as familiar with the requirements of CEOs‚Äô work on safety for two reasons: First, they frequently interact with CEOs in their work, and are familiar with the requirements and frequent activ- ities entailed in a CEO‚Äôs role. Second, they can be considered to be the most senior safety experts in ANSPs, with sound safety knowledge and extensive responsibility for safety. Because the safety managers were asked to describe CEOs, the risk of self- presentation effects were reduced (Morgeson et al., 2004), such as impression management and social desirability effects.  2.1.2.  Procedure  Participants were recruited during three meetings organised by the European Agency for the Safety of Air TrafÔ¨Åc Management (EUROCONTROL; response rate 68%). Participants completed a questionnaire, consisting of two open questions on characteristics and behaviours that were devised with the help of a subject matter expert in ATM. Because not much is known about attributes of CEOs in relation to safety, open questions were used. The questionnaire  asked participants ‚ÄúWhat kind of person do you think an ideal CEO should be regarding his or her effect on safety? Start with the most important characteristic‚Äù and ‚ÄúWhat behaviour do you think an ideal CEO should demonstrate regarding his or her effect on safety? Start with the most important behaviour‚Äù. By asking for ideal, rather than  actual personal attributes, we were more likely to identify good, rather than common practice. The questionnaires had allocated space for 5 responses to each question and participants on average provided four descriptions for each question. Using this format in the questionnaire allowed us to maintain an exploratory approach while including a larger number of people under standardised conditions, so that the results are likely to be robust and applicable to many organisations.  2.1.3. Analysis  The coding of the responses followed the procedures of content analysis (Mayring, 2000). Responses were allocated into the Ô¨Åve attributes derived from the literature whenever possible with non- allocated responses coded to reÔ¨Çect additional concepts. Two in- dependent raters were provided with deÔ¨Ånitions and coding rules (Dey, 1993, see Appendix). After independently coding 50% of the questionnaires, the two raters discussed possible changes to the coding scheme. The majority of responses could be coded into the predeÔ¨Åned attributes. Responses that did not Ô¨Åt into these cate- gories mostly reÔ¨Çected interpersonal leadership so that an addi- tional category of ‚Äòleadership‚Äô was introduced. This category included transformational and transactional leadership behaviours (Bass, 1985), as well as authentic leadership (Avolio et al., 2004). Both raters coded the remaining questionnaires and reviewed the previously coded questionnaires using the revised coding scheme. Interrater reliability of the coding was tested with Krippendorff‚Äôs alpha (Hayes and Krippendorff, 2007) and achieved an agreement of a ¬º .76 (95% CILL .73 to CIUL .80).  2.2.  Results and summary of Study 1  (‚Äúvision-  ‚Äúasks  questions‚Äù).  Overall, 86% of the responses were identiÔ¨Åed as the Ô¨Åve attri- butes listed above, which suggests that these concepts captured the data well (see Table 1). Additionally, leadership was identiÔ¨Åed in 14% of the responses, mostly reÔ¨Çecting transformational ary‚Äù) and transactional leadership, as well as authenticity. Out of the personal characteristics, social competence (16% of the re- sponses) and safety knowledge (15% of the responses) were found to be particularly relevant for a CEO‚Äôs inÔ¨Çuence on organisational safety. The majority of the responses identiÔ¨Åed as social compe- tence referred to a CEO‚Äôs ability to listen (‚Äúbeing a good listener‚Äù, The literature describes the ability of senior managers to convey strong safety messages as central (e.g. Harper et al., 1996). The descriptions identiÔ¨Åed in this study however suggest that having an ‚Äòopen ear‚Äô for safety problems is equally, if not more important for a CEO. Responses identiÔ¨Åed as safety knowledge frequently related to theoretical and practical under- standing of safety (‚Äúunderstanding of safety issues‚Äù), as well as facts and information (‚Äúknows about safety‚Äù) and background and edu- cation (‚Äúeducated in safety problems‚Äù). These responses suggest the ideal CEO requires to be educated in safety and to understand safety issues and risks. Although problem-solving was less frequently mentioned (11% of the responses), responses identiÔ¨Åed as reÔ¨Çecting this concept mostly referred to a CEO‚Äôs ability to understand problems by considering multiple sources of information (‚Äúmakes informed decisions‚Äù), suggesting an inquiring mode as a relevant quality in CEOs‚Äô approaches to safety problems. The content of the responses identiÔ¨Åed as personality (14% of the responses) often reÔ¨Çected aspects of conscientiousness (‚Äúreli- able‚Äù), agreeableness (‚Äúapproachable‚Äù) and openness to experience (‚Äúopen to new ideas‚Äù). The personality trait of agreeableness may support a CEO‚Äôs engagement with others and encourage staff to speak up about safety by generating trust (Clarke and Robertson, 2005). The rigour in a CEO‚Äôs engagement with safety related is- sues is likely to be driven by his or her conscientiousness.  
970  L.S. Fruhen et al.  / Applied Ergonomics 45 (2014) 967e975  Table 1 Summary of frequencies of the model components in questionnaire data (Study 1).  CEOs directly, we captured the views of individuals who are familiar with the work of CEOs, are the most senior safety spe- cialists in organisations and are at the receiving end of CEOs‚Äô safety messages. The use of questionnaires enabled data collection under stand- ardised conditions. Nevertheless, the open question format might have biased the results. Participants were not asked to provide actual, safety related behaviours and characteristics of CEOs. By asking for the ideal behaviours and characteristics of CEOs, we gained insights which can ultimately be used for the development of guidance and best practice sharing. However, it is also possible that these questions triggered respondents‚Äô implicit beliefs about ideal safety leadership. Furthermore, the response format used in this study might have de-contextualised the Ô¨Åndings and the generated responses are not very rich in their content.  3.  Study 2  To further explore the role of the characteristics for senior managerial safety intelligence, this second study employed an interview method. Interviews are a more open approach to data collection and are ideal for capturing issues in their complexity and entirety (Flick, 1998). Consequently this approach allowed us to contextualise our Ô¨Åndings and to better illustrate the content of the personal attributes. The interview questions related to senior managers‚Äô actual work on safety and did not ask them explicitly about ideal characteristics and behaviours for this work, to differ- entiate the approach from the previous study. The senior managers were from a number of different positions, not only CEOs, allowing an evaluation of the characteristics‚Äô relevance for senior managers‚Äô work on safety in those different senior positions.  3.1. Method  3.1.1.  Sample and recruitment  Participants were contacted through the Safety R & D Depart- ment at EUROCONTROL. The sample consisted of senior managers (N ¬º 9, response rate ¬º 81%) working for three national ATM or- ganisations (ANSPs). These subject matter experts held senior po- sitions such as CEO (in charge of management of the entire organisation; n ¬º 2), COO (responsible for the daily operation of the organisation; n ¬º 3), Director of Safety (n ¬º 3) and Director of Air Navigation Services (n ¬º 1), with all being part of the executive teams of their organisations. Average time in position was 32.8 months (SD ¬º 19.3 months).  3.1.2.  Procedure  Individual semi-structured interviews were carried out on site by two trained interviewers. Average interview duration was 74.9 min (SD ¬º 15.7, range 60e113 min), using an explorative approach (Scheele and Groeben, 1988). The interviews touched upon the most central aspect of senior managers‚Äô work in relation to safety (based on descriptions of general senior managerial ac- tivities by Tengblad, 2006). Questions related to the experience of participants, their work environment and typical work activities (e.g. can you describe a typical day‚Äôs work?).

Coding analysis  The interviews were transcribed verbatim and analysed by two independent raters using deductive qualitative content analysis as in Study 1 (Mayring, 2000). The coding scheme included the overall characteristics and their subcomponents (see Appendix 1). Although additional concepts had emerged from Study 1, it was decided to exclude these in the initial coding scheme, to evaluate whether these would also emerge from the interview material. Raters were advised to identify meaning units deÔ¨Åned as ‚Äúwords, sentences or paragraphs containing aspects related to each other through their content and context‚Äù (Graneheim and Lundman, 2004, p. 106). The Ô¨Ånal interrater reliability (a ¬º 0.72; 95% CI 0.67 to 0.77) fulÔ¨Ålled the criteria for tentative conclusions (Krippendorff, 2004).  3.2.

I can see in my business, that  rather than the safety performance being a negative thing,  which it was when I started two years ago, people now see  it as a sense of pride that actually the people that work in  the operations have taken all of these risks out of the  business.‚Äù  ‚ÄúSo I am looking at where the greatest risk lies.

Similar, to Study 1 social competence was most frequently identiÔ¨Åed (33% of all meaning units) and its most relevant content contained engaging with others, persuasion and perceiving others. This Ô¨Ånding is in line with the general senior management litera- ture (e.g. Tengblad, 2006) and the safety literature (e.g. Harper et al., 1996) description of senior managerial activities and this group‚Äôs inÔ¨Çuence on organisations and safety respectively. Also similar to Study 1, safety knowledge was one of the most frequently identiÔ¨Åed characteristic in the interview study (29% of all meaning units). In line with the senior leadership literature (Mintzberg et al., 1998), the results emphasise the importance of facts and infor- mation as an aspect of safety knowledge for senior managerial work. Theoretical and practical understanding and awareness gained by experience regarding safety were also indicated as rele- vant for senior managers‚Äô work in relation to safety. As in Study 1, we also found motivation to be moderately rele- vant (15% of all meaning units). Contrary to the Ô¨Åndings of Study 1 of prevention focus to be more desirable in CEOs according to their subordinates, promotion focus was the most frequently identiÔ¨Åed subcomponent of regulatory focus in this study. Usually, individuals high on promotion focus are described as engaged in behaviours that maximize production, whereas prevention focus leads to more vigilance to ensure safety (Wallace and Chen, 2006). This study, using responses from the senior managers themselves commenting on their own work, indicates that the ideal and actual way that senior managers approach goals in their work might not agree. It seems that senior managers themselves follow an eagerness strategy. Senior managerial work has been described as having  
972  L.S. Fruhen et al.  / Applied Ergonomics 45 (2014) 967e975  increased in workload and intensity since the 1970s (Tengblad, 2006) and it is possible that role incumbents will have a stronger focus on getting things done quickly because of a greater awareness of the workload entailed in their roles. Also similar to Study 1 was the relative frequency with which problem-solving emerged (10% of all meaning units). Understanding problems and generating ideas were the most frequently identiÔ¨Åed subcomponents of problem-solving, whereas planning for action was indicated least frequently. This might reÔ¨Çect the nature of senior managerial work, as they are not necessarily responsible for the implementation of solutions. Generally senior managers need to have an understanding of the problems that their organisations face to prioritise issues and aspects of problems to ensure their decisions reÔ¨Çect their commitment to safety (Fruhen et al., 2013b). The personality traits of the Big Five were least frequently indicated in this study (7% of all meaning units). Previous research reports senior managerial personality (Big Five) as relevant for organisational culture (e.g. Giberson et al., 2009). It is possible that the interviewees did not frequently mention aspects of personality, as questions focused on work activities. It is also possible that this was due to self reporting and actor-observer asymmetry, as actors tend to attribute their own behaviour to stimuli inherent in the situation, whereas observers tend to attribute behaviour to stable dispositions of the actor (Jones and Nisbett, 1971). Within person- ality, conscientiousness was frequently indicated, which can be due to its focus on the way individuals work (Costa and McCrae, 1992), as the interview questions concerned the participants‚Äô work.  3.2.1.  Strengths and limitations of Study 2  Study 2 used interviews to test and complement the Ô¨Åndings of Study 1 and to further investigate the content of the characteristics for senior managers‚Äô safety intelligence. This study was more sub- jective and reÔ¨Çected the inside views of senior managers them- selves. Asking senior managers about their own work could have however biased their responses through impression management. As in the previous study, our analysis was conducted deduc- tively. Had the analysis been carried out inductively, a different set of attributes might have emerged. However, our analysis did allow additional themes to emerge. Finally, it is acknowledged that the sample is small. However, it fulÔ¨Åls the baseline size for saturation, especially for homogenous samples (Guest et al., 2006).  4. Overall discussion  Overall, the results from both studies suggest a set of traits, skills and knowledge relate to senior managers‚Äô safety intelligence. Fig. 1 shows the most relevant characteristics at the centre of safety in- telligence, along with leadership, which emerged from both studies as also relevant, particularly transformational (Study 1) and authentic leadership (Study 2). The Ô¨Åndings echo descriptions of characteristics found to be central to senior managerial inÔ¨Çuence on other organisational outcomes (e.g. Carmeli and Tishler, 2006; Hambrick and Mason, 1984; Miller and Toulouse, 1986, Mumford et al., 2000). Therefore safety as an organisational goal may be achieved in a similar manner as other objectives and requiring similar skills and traits in senior managers. However, the two studies were conducted in ATM, a business that has safety as a central component of its service. These senior managers may approach safety policies as they do other strategic goals. The frequency with which the majority of the characteristics can be ranked did not differ notably in the two studies, notwith- standing the mixed method design. It should be noted that the contents which emerged from Study 2 might be more informative as the subcomponents of each characteristic were identiÔ¨Åed in this study by the coders and should therefore be given a stronger  Fig. 1. Conceptual model of safety intelligence. Note: Characteristics are ordered based on their ranked percentages across the two studies so that the more dominant char- acteristics are a located at the core of the model.  weight in the evaluation of the characteristics content. We discuss each characteristic below, starting with the most relevant.  4.1.  Social competence  The safety literature has frequently described senior managers‚Äô personable communication and active involvement, including site visits as central to their inÔ¨Çuence on safety (Hopkins, 2011; Harper et al., 1996). Likewise, our Ô¨Åndings support social competence to be particularly relevant for senior managerial inÔ¨Çuence on safety. Descriptions of social competence in Study 1 and 2 often reÔ¨Çected a tendency to engage with others through for example an open door policy and suggested the ability to listen to others as especially relevant. This Ô¨Ånding supports Schein‚Äôs (2012) suggestion of humble inquiry as an effective tool for senior managers to inÔ¨Çuence their organisations. Study 2 also showed persuasion to be relevant for senior managers‚Äô safety intelligence and this is likely to help them to communicate strong messages concerning safety policies. Persuasion might be particularly relevant as safety is an abstract goal, for which indicators are not easily deÔ¨Åned (Hale, 2009). Ac- cording to the goal setting theory (Locke and Latham, 1990) these attributes make it all the more challenging to maintain safety as an organisational goal, requiring senior managers to be even more convincing.  4.2.  Safety knowledge  Senior mangers‚Äô knowledge has been identiÔ¨Åed as relevant for their inÔ¨Çuence on organisations (Finkelstein, 1992) and they have been described as information workers (Mintzberg et al., 1998). However, safety knowledge had not been previously considered by the safety literature as contributing to their inÔ¨Çuence on safety. Our Ô¨Åndings suggest that senior managers‚Äô safety knowledge can sup- port them in inÔ¨Çuencing safety positively and so safety knowledge might warrant more attention from safety researchers. Particularly senior managers‚Äô theoretical and practical understanding of safety issues (Study 1) and their knowledge on facts and information (Study 2) were indicated as relevant here.  4.3. Motivation  Motivation, conceptualised Higgins, 1997), was next most  as regulatory focus (Crowe frequently identiÔ¨Åed across  and the  
L.S. Fruhen et al.  / Applied Ergonomics 45 (2014) 967e975  973  two studies. Achievement motivation has been found to strongly correlate with senior managers‚Äô inÔ¨Çuence on organisational out- comes (e.g. Miller et al., 1988) and our Ô¨Åndings suggest that this trait is also relevant for their inÔ¨Çuence on safety. However the re- sults concerning regulatory focus were contradictive between Study 1 and 2. In Study 1 it was mostly identiÔ¨Åed via prevention focus, whereas promotion focus was the dominant theme in Study 2 for this trait (see section 3.2). It is possible that work on safety issues might require senior managers to balance caution with working quickly through a number of tasks (Hambrick, 1989). However, as discussed above, it is possible that the ideal (i.e. pre- vention focus) and the actual (i.e. promotion focus) motivational approaches by senior managers differ. This issue requires more detailed investigation in the future.  4.4.  Problem-solving  Although problem-solving is described as the most important part of senior managerial work (e.g. Eden and Spender, 1998) and as relevant for their inÔ¨Çuence on organisational safety (Zohar and Luria, 2005), it was only found to be the fourth most relevant characteristic across the two studies. Problem-solving was mostly indicated through the way senior managers understand problems and consider various sources of information. Possibly, participants did not mention problem-solving more frequently, because it is not a directly observable activity and senior managers understand it as an integral part of their work (Mintzberg, 1975). Furthermore, problem-solving might have been confounded with other activities such as social interaction, as senior managers often discuss prob- lems in groups and meetings (Zaccaro et al., 2000).  4.5.  Personality  Overall, personality was the least frequently indicated charac- teristic in relation to senior managers‚Äô safety intelligence. Accord- ingly, it should not be considered as central to their inÔ¨Çuence on safety through their policy-making and enactment.  4.6.  Interpersonal  leadership  Finally, although some researchers have argued that interper- sonal leadership is not related to senior level leaders‚Äô inÔ¨Çuence (Zaccaro and Horn, 2003), it emerged from both studies as relevant for their inÔ¨Çuence on organisational safety. The results of Study 1, involving direct reports of CEOs, suggested that CEOs may affect organisational safety through interpersonal leadership styles exerted on their teams. It is possible that this form of inÔ¨Çuence then cascades through the hierarchical layers of the organisations. However it is also possible that, for example authenticity is communicated through interactions during site visits, but might not require direct contact with members of the organisation (i.e. be expressed through speeches or written material). Interpersonal leadership might have emerged more often in Study 1 because the direct reports involved in the data collection were more exposed to their CEOs‚Äô interpersonal leadership behaviours and therefore value them as more prominent and important. It is however also probable that interpersonal leadership is especially relevant for CEOs‚Äô inÔ¨Çuence on safety as it has previously been found to inÔ¨Çu- ence Ô¨Årm performance (Waldman et al., 2004). In summary, we found safety intelligence in senior managers, i.e. their positive inÔ¨Çuence on safety through their ability to device and enact safety policies, to be particularly supported by their social competence and safety knowledge. It can be proposed that social competence will particularly aid senior managers in enacting their  policies and that safety knowledge is central to the development of these policies.  4.7.  Future research  This study is only a Ô¨Årst, exploratory step towards a better un- derstanding of attributes relevant to senior managers‚Äô safety in- telligence. Future research can build on our Ô¨Åndings by considering the following issues. First, an investigation of the views of em- ployees further down the organisational hierarchy can complement the perspective of direct reports and role incumbents. Inclusion of more junior managers and the workforce can help identify whether senior managers‚Äô personal characteristics vary in their inÔ¨Çuence on safety at different organisational levels. Secondly, the safety intel- ligence attributes in this study could be studied in relation to safety outcomes such as safety culture, but also to employees‚Äô safety related behaviours, accident rates or even safety policies. Finally, future research should be carried out in industry sectors other than ATM, as these other industries might pose different challenges for senior managers.  4.8.  Conclusion and practical  implications  CEOs and other senior managers carry the responsibility for their organisations (Hambrick, 1989). Investigation reports repeatedly highlight this group‚Äôs contribution to organisational safety, yet they are under researched (Flin, 2003). Insights of what it takes in terms of characteristics to perform safety related man- agement duties effectively are essential to inform best practices for selection, training, evaluation and reward systems (Landy and Vasey, 1991). The Ô¨Åndings of the two studies can have relevance for the determination of selection criteria for CEOs and other senior managers. It can be proposed that social competence and safety knowledge will be the most effective areas to target for trainings and other interventions. These Ô¨Åndings have been included in a recent White Paper published by EUROCONTROL (2013) to provide guidance to senior managers in ATM concerning their inÔ¨Çuence on safety. It needs to be considered to what extent the Ô¨Åndings from the ATM domain can be applied in other industry settings. How- ever, because ATM is so highly reliable, it is proposed that they are likely to represent characteristics that will be effective in managing organisational safety in many other industries. Application of the insights from this study may help to ensure senior managers have what it takes to be safety intelligent.  Acknowledgement  We thank EUROCONTROL of supporting this work.

s0003687013002664,"  Hierarchical task analysis (HTA) seeks to provide an under- standing of humanehuman and humanemachine interactions (Rose and Bearman, 2012). HTA describes a system in terms of its goals. It begins with a main task deÔ¨Åned by its intended goals and breaks down the main task into its components tasks. Each sub- task having a sub-goal to achieve e all of which taken together contribute towards achievement of the main task goal (Stanton, 2006). These sub-tasks may be further analysed to their constitu- ent tasks and so on. Levels of analysis of a main task depend on complexity and required description of the task or goal (Lane et al., 2006; Phipps et al., 2008). Rules guide the sequence in which sub- goals are attained to achieve the ‚Äòhigher‚Äô goal (Phipps et al., 2008) and, accordingly, higher levels in the hierarchy inÔ¨Çuence the manner in which lower levels behave (Shepherd, 2010). Task analysis is also a useful way of looking at how people interact with work processes and environments. To date, HTA has successfully been used in association with human error identiÔ¨Åcation (HEI) techniques to detect potential human errors (Rose and Bearman, 2012; Stanton, 2006; Stanton et al., 2009). HEI techniques are structured methods dealing with  * Corresponding author. Tel.: √æ61 7 46311254; fax: √æ61 7 46311533. E-mail address: Latif.Al-Hakim@unisa.edu.au (L.

The ‚Äòerror mode‚Äô tax- onomy of an HEI is used to highlight potentially unforseen errors in the lowest level tasks of an HTA (Phipps et al., 2008; Shorrock and Kirwan, 2002; Stanton et al., 2009). Once the potential error or disruption is predicted, an error reduction strategy can be imple- mented (Shorrock and Kirwan, 2002). HEI has been widely used across the industry (Rose and Bearman, 2012), for example in aviation (Shorrock and Kirwan, 2002). Recently, HEI techniques have been successfully applied to predict potential disruptions and errors in healthcare services, including medication administration (Lane et al., 2006), anaesthesia (Phipps et al., 2008) and surgery (Joice et al., 1998).  1.1.  The surgical setting and patient safety  In surgical settings, when a patient gets transferred into the operating room (OR) to have a surgical procedure carried out, several tasks should be accomplished e including patient positioning on the operating table. These tasks are shared between different members of the OR team e including surgeons, anaesthetists, and OR nurses. For the purpose of this paper, the way in which a task is planned to achieve its goal is referred to as ‚Äòpractice‚Äô. A practice can also be expressed in terms of the sub-goals and the plan via which these sub-goals are sequenced to achieve the higher goal. Different prac- tices may be used to perform the same task.

From a human factors and ergonomic analysis perspective, each practice implies a range of potential errors with different consequences. Where more than one practices can be used to perform a task, it is commonly expected of the operating surgeon to select the practice producing minimal potential risk to the patient. Thus the question arises whether some of these practices have lower error potential e and hence whether such practices should be recommended as standards. To address this question, in this paper we consider the OR as a business entity in which various business processes are performed to achieve the strategic target of the business entity; patient safety. This allows us to integrate HTA/HEI with the business process management (BPM) approach and to apply principles of BPM to select practices that can eliminate or reduce potential errors. Prior to reporting our analyses and in order to provide a full rationale for our approach, we Ô¨Årst explore the limitations of the current HTA/HEI approaches.  1.2.  Limitations of HTA/HEI  As described in the literature, HTA/HEI techniques examine the lowest level of HTA hierarchy for potential errors (Shorrock and Kirwan, 2002). Joice et al. (1998) classiÔ¨Åed errors captured by HTA/HEI techniques into two groups; ‚Äòinterstep‚Äô errors and ‚Äòintra- step‚Äô errors. An iterstep error occurs when the operator (e.g. sur- geon) fails to execute a sub-task or re-arrange its sequence; an intrastep error involves the failure of a surgeon to correctly execute an individual sub-task. These types of errors are reported in the surgical literature as ‚Äòerrors of execution‚Äô (Kohn et al., 2000; Sevdalis et al., 2008; Wiegmann et al., 2007). However, the litera- ture also points to another type of errors referred to as ‚Äòerrors of planning‚Äô which occurs when a surgeon fails to select the most appropriate practice to achieve the task‚Äôs strategic goal, that is, patient safety. A speciÔ¨Åc practice in surgery may enhance capacity and performance in certain environments but may have no effect in others; for example, obtaining unobstructed images on both cross- table anterosterior and lateral views is essential for spinal surgery known as ‚Äòdirect lateral interbody fusion‚Äô, or DLIF (Arnold et al., 2012) but not needed for other procedures requiring lateral posi- tioning of the patient. Further, a practice may lead to an error in a situation but the same practice may be necessary in another situ- ation based on the patient‚Äôs physiological status, which differs from one patient to another. An example of this is allowing an awake patient to walk from a trolley to the operating table. This practice could create an error if the patient is obese (Philips, 2004). It is therefore difÔ¨Åcult to identify real potential errors based on exam- ining only lower-level tasks without examining practices used to achieve higher-level tasks. What appears to be a key limitation of the current HTA/HEI approaches is that they typically identify potential errors in a predeÔ¨Åned set of sub-tasks, rather than examining potential errors in practice selection (see example above). Another issue in HEI approaches is that they typically require a set of generic error modes as part of their error taxonomies e but these modes, as a result of examining individual lower-level tasks, may not neces- sarily identify the whole range of potential errors (Stanton et al., 2009; Stanton et al., 2005) e and there may even be difÔ¨Åculty in specifying a single mode for error (Joice et al., 1998). Such limita- tions of the current HTA/HEI approaches could be tackled by developing an error taxonomy that has the capability to identify practices with high potential risk to patient safety and to help in selecting alternative practices. This will be developed in the ‚Äò"

The sensor data can be used in software applications through the use of a software development kit (SDK) (Microsoft, USA). In addition to depth (Depth data) and color data (RGB data), the sensor provides information about the position of the joints of recognized users present in the frame (skeleton data) in close to real time. The information is provided in the form of an array with the coordinates of 20 points. These points are the positions of the center of the major joints of the human body and, in some cases (head, spine, hands and feet), estimations of the center of the major limbs.

The joint centers are obtained from a randomized de- cision forest algorithm and the data seem to be accurate enough to be used for postural assessment (Bonnech√®re et al., 2013a; Clark et al., 2012; Dutta, 2012; Martin et al., 2012; Raptis et al., 2011). In this paper we will analyze if these devices can help evaluators that use observational techniques for ergonomic job assessment. The methods for assessing exposure to risk factors for work- related musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) can be classiÔ¨Åed ac- cording to the degree of accuracy and precision of data collection and to how intervening the measuring technique is for the work done by the worker (van der Beek and Frings-Dresen, 1998; Wells et al., 1997). Observational methods are methods based on direct observation of the worker during the course of his work. They have the advantages of being straightforward to use, applicable to a wide range of working situations and appropriate for surveying large numbers of subjects at comparatively low cost; however these methods use data collection systems that are not very accurate and provide rather broad results. Instrument-based or direct mea- surement methods employ sensors attached to the subject for measuring certain variables These methods collect accurate data, but are intervening, require considerable initial investment to purchase the equipment, as well as the resources necessary to cover the costs of maintenance and the employment of highly trained and skilled technical staff to ensure their effective operation (David, 2005; Trask and Mathiassen, 2012).

Additionally, when the worker is performing dynamic tasks the observations can be less reliable or even invalid (DeLooze et al., 1994) because serious information bias may occur in exposure data on working postures. The observational methods based on time sampling analyze postural duration as a risk factor which is measured as the relative frequency of occurrence of each risk category (level of risk). How- ever, the analysis of frequency, or time variation of risk, requires the use of devices with high sampling rates (van der Beek and Frings- Dresen, 1998). Some studies have addressed this issue using tech- niques such as computer vision (Pinzke and Kopp, 2001). Thus, although the validity of the results of the observational methods for the assessment of postural load is supported by many studies, data collection inaccuracy and low sampling rates are the biggest drawbacks of these methods. The use of low-cost range sensors like Microsoft‚Äôs Kinect√î could be useful in the collection of data at very high frequencies, but it is necessary to check the accuracy and reliability of the data collected. Previous studies have analyzed the ability of Kinect√î for use as a 3D motion capture system in working environments, concluding that the sensor accuracy is only slightly lower than that of more expensive devices, but reliable enough for use in ergonomic assessment of work stations (Clark et al., 2012; Dutta, 2012). In the present work we have used a low-cost range sensor (Microsoft‚Äôs Kinect√î) for data collection, following which an observational method was used to assess postural load (OWAS). The aim is to determine the suitability of the device to collect the information requested by the method, and compare the results with the observations made by human observers using photo- graphs or videos. The use of low-cost range sensors maintains all the beneÔ¨Åts of observational methods and it does not increase the cost of application, since the low initial investment required to purchase the equipment (149 V in Spain in 2012) is offset by the shorter time needed for data processing (Trask and Mathiassen, 2012). They are also easy to use, do not require complex calibra- tion processes and do not affect the work process. All these factors make practitioners prefer observational methods to direct mea- surement techniques. Another objective of this work is to test the reliability of the assessment when the worker is not facing the sensor. It is known that the capacity of the sensor to precisely detect the joints position greatly decreases in this situation (Natural User Interface for Kinect for Windows, 2013). The results of this work will show that this is an important drawback in using Kinect√î to assess postures in a real work environment. To conduct the present study we selected the OWAS method (Ovako Working Posture Analysis System) (Karhu et al., 1977). Unlike other postural assessment methods like RULA (McAtamney and Nigel Corlett, 1993), REBA (Hignett and McAtamney, 2000) or LUBA (Kee and Karwowski, 2001) which analyze individual body segments, OWAS makes multiple observations of the posture of the worker during work. OWAS has been applied to a wide range of industries (Pinzke, 1992). A signiÔ¨Åcant relationship between the back postures as deÔ¨Åned by OWAS and prevalence in lower back pain has been established by epidemiological analysis (Burdorf et al., 1991). In the following sections, the OWAS method is brieÔ¨Çy presented and the procedure followed to transform the data provided by the sensor so that it can be used by the method is described. Then the results obtained are compared with those ob- tained by human observers and Ô¨Ånally the main conclusions are summarized.  Fig. 1.

Regarding the methods for assessing postural load, some observational methods collect data at set time intervals to make an estimate of the overall worker‚Äôs exposure to MSD risk factors. Ob- servations are often made on categories of exposure, and the pro- portion of time recorded for each exposure category is the ratio of the number of observations recorded for the category to the total number of observations. Unlike direct methods, observational methods have limitations in the sampling rates. Many studies have analyzed the degree of validity of the sampling rates and have compared their results with those of direct measurement methods; however these studies greatly differ in their conclusions (Alex Burdorf et al., 1992; Juul-Kristensen et al., 2001; Paquet et al., 2001; Spielholz et al., 2001). To facilitate the implementation of observational methods workers activities are recorded by video or photographs. Afterward, the exposure can be observed from a monitor with the opportunity to use slow motion and to review the images. An observer can register a limited number of postural variables reliably (Doumes and Dul, 1991; Genaidy et al., 1993), therefore, observations of occupational activities can best be joined with data from video observation (van der Beek and Frings-Dresen, 1998; Coenen et al., 2011). However, the use of photographs or videos in the observa- tional methods also presents drawbacks. For example, in the measurement of angles, the location of the camera must be chosen with care to avoid distortion due to the camera‚Äôs Ô¨Åeld of view (Doumes and Dul, 1991). Sometimes certain angles can be properly measured from one Ô¨Åeld of view, but other angles are distorted and would require the recording of simultaneous images from different Ô¨Åelds of view (Knudson and Morrison, 2002).

The software could be freely down- loaded from http://www.ergonautas.com/lab/kinect (http://www. ergonautas.com/lab/kinect). The free Microsoft Kinect Software Development Kit was used as the interface with the sensor. For the geometrical calculations and graphical representation GLScene, a free OpenGL based 3D library for Delphi was used.  2.1. Development of software for data retrieval  from Kinect√î  ergonautas-NUI can retrieve and process data from up to four different sensors simultaneously, representing the RGB Map and the Depth Map (numbers 2 and 3 in Fig. 4). The Depth Map is processed by Kinect√î that calculates the positions of the joints of recognized users present in the frame, transforming the co- ordinates into an array of data. The x, y, and z-axes are the axes of the depth sensor (Fig. 3). This is a right-handed coordinate system Kinect√î at that places a the origin with the positive z-axis extending in the direction of the sensor‚Äôs camera. The positive y- axis extends upward, and the positive x-axis extends to the left (Natural User Interface for Kinect for Windows, 2013). To facilitate the display and processing of the data, ergonautas-NUI automati- cally transforms all the coordinates so that the foot located below (joints 15 or 19 in Fig. 1) coincides with the ground (coordinate y ¬º 0), and the hip center is always held in a vertical axis with coordinates x ¬º z ¬º 0. It is necessary to remark that hip center is the joint 0 shown in Fig. 1, and it does not represent the true anatomical hip joint center. The modiÔ¨Åed skeleton joint position data is dis- played in real time (number 4 in Fig. 4). RGB Map, Depth Map and skeleton data can be recorded, stored and re-processed by ergonautas-NUI (number 5 in Fig. 4) using Kinect Studio√î. A tracked joint that is not visible to the camera is inferred by Kinect√î sensor. That is, the joint position is calculated from sur- rounding joint data rather than being directly captured by the camera (Natural User Interface for Kinect for Windows, 2013). The software developed allows the operator to decide whether to use or discard the postures in which the position of a joint has been inferred. ergonautas-NUI records the skeletal tracking joint information at regular time intervals. The sampling rate can be regulated by the evaluator between 25 s and 1 h. The data collected is processed to obtain the codes for each body posture and risk action level (number 6 in Fig. 4). The procedure followed for data processing is described in the next section. The frequency values of the postures recorded are used to calculate the percentage of time spent in each  OWAS method can estimate the static load of the worker in the workplace by analyzing the worker‚Äôs postures during work. The system identiÔ¨Åes the positions of the back, shoulders and legs of the worker and the weight of the load handled. The evaluator makes observations at regular intervals of 30e60 s coding each posture according to the digits shown in Fig. 2, and an additional fourth digit depending on the load handled by the worker. Therefore, each body posture is coded by four digits corresponding to the back, shoulders, legs and load in this order. Based on the body position code OWAS identiÔ¨Åes four classes which reÔ¨Çect static load risk degree (Mattila and Vilki, 1999). Class 1: Normal posture. No intervention required. Class 2: Slightly harmful. Corrective action should be taken during next regular review of working methods. Class 3: Distinctly harmful. Corrective action should be taken as soon as possible. Class 4: Extremely harmful. Corrective action should be taken immediately. OWAS method assesses postural load for each of the body parts considered, depending on the time that individuals spend in different postures during the course of their working day. The relative amount of time of each posture over a working day (or period analyzed) is calculated from the frequency of occurrence of each posture compared to the total number of postures recorded during the sampling process. In this way, the system can calculate the percentage of occurrence of each position of back, arms and legs. As this percentage increases the worker‚Äôs postural load is greater, and consequently the priority and urgency for ergonomic intervention and corrective action. The real proportion of time in each posture is estimated from the observed postures. Therefore, the estimation error decreases as the total number of observations increases. The limit for this error (with 95% probability) based on 100 observations is 10%. The error limits based on 200, 300 and 400 observations are 7%, 6% and 5% respectively (Louhevaara and Suurn√§kki, 1992; Mattila and Vilki, 1999). The values obtained through observations can be consid- ered reliable when the error limit is below 10%.

Data processing  The information about the coordinates x, y and z of the joints of the tracked subject is obtained from the sensor in the form of an array with three columns (one for each coordinate) and 20 rows. Each row corresponds to a joint in the order shown in Fig. 1. To get the postural risk level it is necessary to classify the positions of the back, shoulders and legs. The process begins by calculating three auxiliary planes (sagittal, frontal, trunk) (Fig. 5). The sagittal plane is obtained as the plane perpendicular to the straight line con- necting the left and right hip (12 and 16) and passing through the hip center (0). The frontal plane is calculated as a vertical plane which passes through both hips (12 and 16). The trunk plane is determined as the plane passing through the hips and neck (12, 16 and 2). These planes are calculated for each tracked posture. To identify the position of the back it is necessary to calculate the angles of Ô¨Çexion, lateral bending and trunk rotation. The trunk Ô¨Çexion angle is calculated by projecting the neck (2) on the sagittal plane and measuring the angle between the line connecting this point and the hip (0) with a vertical line. Although the OWAS method does not indicate from what angle the trunk can be considered to be Ô¨Çexed, it may be assumed to occur at angles than 20 greater (Mattila and Vilki, 1999). For the calculation of lateral bending the line connecting the shoulders (4 and 8) is projected on the trunk plane, measuring the angle formed by this line and the line connecting the hips (12 and 16). Trunk rotation is measured by calculating the angle between the line joining the shoulders and that same line projected on the trunk plane.  To determine if the arms are above or below the shoulders the y coordinates of the elbows (5 and 9) are compared with those of the shoulders (4 and 8).   Legs  The position of the legs is classiÔ¨Åed depending on whether there is bilateral support and on the bending angle of each leg. To Ô¨Ånd out if both feet are Ô¨Çat on the ground the y axes of the feet (15 and 19) are compared. If the difference is greater than a certain threshold value set by the evaluator the observed subject is considered to rest on one leg (the threshold used in this work was 30 mm). The bending of the legs is calculated by measuring the angle formed by the line connecting the hip to the knee and the line connecting the knee to the ankle. The postures of the worker can be classiÔ¨Åed depending on the bending angles of the legs and whether both feet are Ô¨Çat on the ground. Furthermore, to determine if the worker is walking, the position of the hip (0) is measured at regular intervals of time. If the travel speed exceeds a threshold value set by the evaluator the worker is considered to be moving.   Load  Load handling cannot be determined from the sensor‚Äôs data. Although some algorithms allow the system to detect load handling by attaching markers to the load, we decided that the evaluator could input this information directly into the system. The evaluator selects the correct option (less than 10 kg, between 10 and 20 kg or more than 20 kg) at the appropriate time. This does not become a  Please cite this article in press as: Diego-Mas, J.A., Alcaide-Marzal, J., Using Kinect√î sensor in observational methods for assessing postures at work, Applied Ergonomics (2013), http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2013.12.001

Although Kinect√î provides a simple way to obtain depth maps and depth images at a rate of up to 30 frames per second, data processing is time consuming. Yet the speed of posture data acquisition and assessment can reach 25 observations per second on a desktop PC with a 3.4 GHz processor and 4 GB RAM.  2.3.  Experimental procedure  The result of the postural load assessment obtained with Kin- ectTM was compared with the results obtained by human ob- servers using the recorded images. The analysis was also used to determine how the orientation of the worker with respect to the sensor affected the results. It is known that the Skeleton Tracking algorithm for Kinect√î works better when the users are facing the sensor (Natural User Interface for Kinect for Windows, 2013). The reliability of the joints positions diminish quickly when the angle between the sensor and the observed subject sagittal plane in- creases. This is an important drawback in using Kinect√î to assess postures in a real work environment. In order to test this problem several sensor orientations were used in this work. Although multiple sensors covering different orientations can be used simultaneously this tends to decrease the accuracy of the system in detecting body positions. The emitter of each sensor projects a speckled pattern of infrared light in the detection area. If more than one sensor is used simultaneously their patterns interfere affecting posture detection (Natural User Interface for Kinect for Windows, 2013). For this reason we decided not to record the same sequence of movements using several sensors with different ori- entations with respect to the worker. Instead, we designed a sequence protocol of movements that a player had to follow in front of one sensor, changing from one posture to the next at set time intervals and without handling a load. The postures adopted by the  player of the sequence could be categorized in 55 of the 72 possible classiÔ¨Åcations of OWAS (sitting postures and variable loads are not considered in this work). The remaining 17 posture classiÔ¨Åcations that are not present in the sequence are very improbable and un- stable, (e.g., standing only on one knee bent with both arms above the shoulder and back bent and twisted), therefore this kind of postures was not adopted in the used sequence of movements. The total duration of the motion sequence was about 196 s. The subject performed the sequence of postures 5 times at different angles relative to the sensor (0 , 20 , 40 , 60 and 80 ), i.e. varying the angle between the sagittal plane and the sensor (Fig. 6). We called each of them with the word Sequence and the corresponding angle, i.e. Sequence 0 , Sequence 20. The distance between the sensor and the player was, in all cases, 3 m. In order to play the sequence of movements always in the same way, we showed each posture to the player in a screen. Each posture was shown at the right moment. The sequences of movements were recorded using Kinect Studio√î. This software can record and play back depth and color streams from a Kinect√î, creating repeatable scenarios for testing, and analyze performance. The Kinect for Windows SDK provides a mechanism to smooth the joint positions in a frame. The skeletal tracking joint informa- tion can be adjusted across different frames to minimize jittering and stabilize the joint positions over time. The smoothing process is controlled by four parameters that can be tuned using ergonautas- NUI:   Smoothing: Its value must be in the range [0,1]. Higher values indicate high smoothing.

In general, discrepancies occurred in postures in which the tracked subject was performing a movement, which involved a change in the classiÔ¨Åcation of the posture. For example, in a movement in which the subject lifts an arm the classiÔ¨Åcation of the position of the arms changes when the elbow reaches the level of the shoulder. If the observation is made at that moment there is some ambiguity about the category to which the posture belongs. After jointly analyzing the 114 postures the experts came to an agreement about the category they fell into. In Sequence 0 there were about 212 observations (27.04%) in which the position of one body part (back, arms or legs) was incorrectly classiÔ¨Åed by Kinect√î, i.e. the OWAS code position assigned differed from the one assigned by experts. The errors detected were due to incorrect codiÔ¨Åcation of the position of the back in 34 postures (4.34%), arms in 40 postures (5.10%) and legs in 164 postures (20.92%). 26 observations had errors in the codiÔ¨Åca- tion of two body members. The risk category of each posture was correctly classiÔ¨Åed by the sensor in 88.77% of cases. That is, 88 postures were categorized into an incorrect postural risk category. Although a body part can be incorrectly coded the posture may fall into the right risk category. Thus, while the position of some body parts was incorrectly coded in 212 postures, in 124 cases this error did not involve a wrong risk category classiÔ¨Åcation. Two-dimensional contingency tables of experts‚Äô observations and Kinect√î observations are shown in Tables 1e4. The Proportion agreement index (Po) and the strength of agreement on a sample- to-sample basis as expressed by Cohen‚Äôs k are shown in Table 5.  4. Discussion  In this study the recordings from the experts were used as a standard and compared with the observations of a low-cost range sensor. Inter-observer and intra-observer agreements in the application of OWAS by human observers have been studied in other works (De Bruijn et al., 1998; Karhu et al., 1977; Kee and Karwowski, 2007; Kivi and Mattila, 1991; Mattila et al., 1993); this issue was beyond the scope of the present work. Our aim was to determine the degree of similarity between the observations agreed upon by human evaluators and those obtained by Kinect√î. This sensor performs better when the subject is facing the sensor; therefore we also studied how the orientation of the camera can affect data collection. For this purpose, a subject performed a sequence of postures 5 times facing the sensor located at different angles relative to the sagittal plane of the subject (0 , 20 , 40 , 60 and 80 ). Although we tried to keep duration and speed of the movements constant, the total length of the sequences was slightly different, varying between 189 and 199 s. This meant that the number of observations in each sequence was different and consequently comparisons between the different positions of the sensor could be somehow affected. The comparison of results of Sequence 0 obtained by human evaluators and the sensor reveals a high inter-method agreement in the postures (Po ¬º 0.89, k ¬º 0.83).

Lower values are slower to correct to- wards the raw data and appear smoother, while higher values will correct toward the raw data more quickly.  Prediction: Sets the number of frames to predict the data in the future. New raw data is adjusted to the predicted values of previous captured frames.  JitterRadius: Any jitter beyond the scope of this parameter  MaxDeviationRadius: during one time step is clamped to the jitter reduction radius. Is the maximum radius in meters that Ô¨Åltered positions are allowed to deviate from the data obtained.  Experimentation is required on an application-by-application basis in order to provide the required level of Ô¨Åltering and smoothing (Azimi, 2013). Therefore a preliminary analysis was carried out to determine which combination of parameters was better suited for our study. Data Ô¨Åltering was necessary for the accurate determination of the positions of the body. The removal of jitter is important and, although the reaction time also needs to be high enough, it was seen that some latency does not affect results for observation frequencies below 5 per second. Based on our early small experiments the parameters used were Smoothing 0.6, Correction 0.2, Prediction 0.5, JitterRadius 0.1 and MaxDevia- tionRadius 0.1. The recorded motion sequences were played back with Kinect Studio√î, and the data were analyzed with ergonautas-NUI. Observation frequency was set at 4 frames per second, recording between 756 and 797 observations at each motion sequence. For each sequence ergonautas e NUI determined the number of pos- tures in each type of risk, OWAS risk indicator and the number of inferred postures, i.e. the number of postures in which some essential body joint to determine the posture code was not visible and therefore its position was inferred. For the comparison analysis of results obtained using Kinect√î and by human observation two experts in OWAS method analyzed the images of the 784 postures at Sequence 0 . The experts inde- pendently classiÔ¨Åed each posture into a risk category. The postures that the experts classiÔ¨Åed in different manners were then analyzed again to reach a consensus on the score. Sequence 0 was chosen as a standard because Skeleton Tracking works best when the tracked user is facing the sensor (Natural User Interface for Kinect for Windows, 2013).  3.

Table 3 reveals that the sensor does not work well when the tracked user in kneeling. About 53.14% of the pos- tures in which the subject was kneeling the position of the legs were classiÔ¨Åed as ‚ÄúStanding on both legs straight‚Äù. This could happen because when the tracked subject is facing the sensor, his lower legs are hidden by his upper legs. Therefore in this position the sensor confuses the knees with the feet, determining that the subject is standing on both legs straight. Similarly, when the subject stands on a single bent leg the posture is classiÔ¨Åed as ‚ÄúStanding on both knees bent‚Äù in 34.21% of cases. Although 212 postures had errors in the coding of the position of its body parts, in 124 cases this error did not involve a change in the risk category of the posture. A more detailed analysis of the incorrectly coded postures reveals that they correspond to postures recorded while the tracked subject was performing a movement that caused a change in the coding of the position of one body member. For example, in a movement in which the subject lifts an arm, the code of the arm position changes when the elbow reaches the level of the shoulder. If the recording is taken at that moment there is some ambiguity about posture coding. These errors have little effect on the overall postural load risk since they tend to compensate each other. For example, if the error occurs when the subject raises his arm, it will be compensated by the opposite error when the subject lowers his arm again. Of the 212 postures that were incorrectly coded in Sequence 0 , 70 correspond to inferred postures. The percentage of incorrectly coded postures is 42.17% in the case of inferred postures versus 22.98% in non-inferred postures. This means that error probability is higher in inferred than in non-inferred postures. The number of inferred postures over the total number of observations increases at high angles between the individual sagittal plane and the sensor (see Fig. 7), thus leading to higher error values. The software developed allows the evaluator to decide whether to use the  Table 3 Contingency table of legs position classiÔ¨Åcations that were obtained by experts and Kinect√î.

To check the appropriateness of using or not using inferred observations in the calculation of risk, the analysis of Sequence 0 was repeated but this time discarding inferred ob- servations and comparing the results with previous calculations. The analysis was then performed on the remaining 618 postures. The classiÔ¨Åcation of postures of Sequence 0 made by human ob- servers was: Risk 1 (46.05%), Risk 2 (28.83%), Risk 3 (12.37%) and Risk 4 (12.76%). The resulting classiÔ¨Åcation of postures with Kinect using inferred observations was: Risk 1 (45.28%), Risk 2 (33.67%), Risk 3 (12.24%) and Risk 4 (8.80%). Finally, discarding inferred postures, the results were: Risk 1 (56.15%), Risk 2 (27.51%), Risk 3 (11.65%) and Risk 4 (4.69%). This shows that posture distribution in the different risk levels changes, obtaining a substantial increase in the percentage of positions in Risk 1 when inferred postures are discarded. This could be because the other risk levels include postures that are more likely to occlude a body part, and that are consequently inferred by the skeleton tracker. Thus, eliminating the inferred postures from the risk analysis in Sequence 0 leads to greater misclassiÔ¨Åcation than that obtained by considering the inferred postures. As can be seen in Fig. 7, the number of inferred observations signiÔ¨Åcantly increases from angles of 20 . When the tracked subject is facing the sensor, in 21.17% of the postures a body part is not visible for the sensor and it has to be inferred. From 20 this per- centage increases rapidly up to 92.20% for angles of 80 . These re- sults are consistent with the fact that the Skeleton Tracking algorithm for Kinect√î works better when the users are facing the sensor (Natural User Interface for Kinect for Windows, 2013). The number of observations in each sequence of movements differs slightly and the human experts only analyzed the observations of Sequence 0 ; therefore, it is not possible to directly compare the rest of sequences with the experts‚Äô opinion. We know from the analysis of Sequence 0 that inferred postures are more likely to be misclassiÔ¨Åed. Therefore, the bigger percentage of inferred postures in the rest of sequences may increase the number of errors. Moreover, when the angle between the sensor and the sagittal plane of the observed worker increases, the differences between an inferred posture and the real posture could be bigger, and this could increase the percentage of inferred postures wrong coded. On the other hand, the percentage of wrong coded postures among no inferred postures could be different too. To test these possibilities we randomly took a sample of 50 inferred observations and 50  Table 5 Proportion agreement index (Po) and Cohen‚Äôs k, showing for each variable the level of agreement of the experts‚Äô values with the sensor values for Sequence 0 .

We analyzed each of the 400 postures checking if it was correctly coded and correctly classiÔ¨Åed into a risk category, obtaining the results shown in Figs. 7 and 8. In Fig. 7 the estimated percentages over the total number of observations of right and wrong coded and right and wrong cate- gorized postures are shown for each sequence. It must be remembered that although a body part can be incorrectly coded the posture may fall into the right risk category. From these data, it could be seen that the percentage of inferred observation wrong coded increases when the angle between the sensor and the sagittal plane of the observed worker increases. A chi-squared test was performed to determine whether or not there were signiÔ¨Åcant differences amongst the proportions. Since the obtained P-value was 0.016 there are signiÔ¨Åcant differences between the samples at the 95% conÔ¨Ådence level. Therefore, it could be supposed that the differences between inferred postures and real postures are bigger when the angle between the sensor and the sagittal plane of the observed worker increases, and that this causes an increase of the percentage of inferred postures wrong coded. The same analysis performed over the no inferred observations shown that there are no signiÔ¨Åcant differences between the percentages of right and wrong coded postures at the 95% conÔ¨Ådence level (P- value ¬º 0.919). Therefore, the error rate in coding no inferred po- sitions does not seem to vary with the angle. Fig. 8 shows the estimated total percentages of right coded and right categorized postures. The results show that the percentage of right categorized postures in an OWAS risk category using Kinect√î is over 80% when the angle between the sagittal plane of the  worker and the sensor is lower than or equal to 40 . Higher angles result in higher error values up to 50% for angles of 80 . It must be remembered that an analysis of the incorrectly categorized pos- tures reveals that many of them correspond to postures recorded while the tracked subject was performing a movement that caused a change in the coding of the position of a body member, and that these errors have little effect on the overall postural risk since they tend to compensate each other. Therefore, although the results are promising, there are still certain aspects relative to the use of low-cost range sensors in real working environments that need further research. Kinect√î could be a good skeleton tracking system when the subject is facing the is in the range of 40 . Otherwise data reliability de- sensor or creases signiÔ¨Åcantly. This is a signiÔ¨Åcant drawback in cases where the tracked user assumes postures with different orientations with respect to the sensor. Moreover, in real scenarios it is common to Ô¨Ånd objects that prevent the sensor from properly monitoring some body parts of the tracked user to the sensor. Something similar happens when the worker handles large objects that make it difÔ¨Åcult for the camera to detect certain parts of the body. This problem can be solved using multiple sensors oriented at different angles relative to the tracked subject. However, as mentioned above, the simultaneous use of several sensors causes interference between speckled patterns and makes it difÔ¨Åcult for the sensor to detect the positions of the body (Natural User Interface for Kinect for Windows, 2013). Furthermore, only one sensor can report skeleton data for each process. However, it is possible to know when a sensor has a poor vision of the worker and then sequen- tially switch other sensors on and off.

In the present study we did not analyze sitting positions or automatic load detection. OWAS method considers 3 weight ranges (less than 10 kg, 10e20 kg and more than 20 kg). Automatic load detection would be desirable if the load handled by the worker greatly varies over the course of his work. Future research may consider attaching markers to the load, and using the depth sensor and video camera data to track these additions and achieve auto- matic load detection (Clark et al., 2012; Ong et al., 2008). Finally, nowadays, Kinect√î system is not able to assess internal/ external joint rotations in the peripheral limbs. Another main drawback of the Kinect skeleton is in a very non-anthropometric kinematic model with variable limb lengths. Although this does not seem to be a problem for ergonomic assessment by OWAS and others applications where less information is needed (Obdrz√°lek et al., 2012), the use of other methods such as RULA, REBA, LULA or PATH (Buchholz et al., 1996) requires to measure joint rotations and an improved kinematic model. Microsoft√î recently announced the launch of Kinect 2√î. Among other features, the new version can detect joint rotations. On the other hand, new improved anatomical models are being developed for Kinect√î (Bonnech√®re et al., 2013b), and could be used for assessing postural load by other methods.  5.  Conclusions  The analysis presented in this work suggests that low-cost range sensors can be a useful tool for the collection of data for use in observational methods for the assessment of postures, although further research is needed in order to use them in real work en- vironments. These devices automatically record body positions at high sampling frequency, thus providing accurate and reliable es- timates of frequency and duration of risk exposure. Its use has advantages over camera systems that deÔ¨Åne joint centers and anatomical landmarks based on markers placed on the skin (setup  time required, uncomfortable exposure of areas of the body such as the thorax, hips and thighs.) (Clark et al., 2012). However, the application of these devices requires overcoming problems such as lack of accuracy when the tracked subject is not facing the sensor or when a part of the body is not visible to the camera. Nowadays range sensors can be used like a tool to support the ergonomists tasks, but its technology is not enough developed to replace the assessment by human expert.  "
s0003687013002688,"  Shift work is associated with a higher risk of accidents and ill health (√Ökerstedt, 1990). These negative effects of shift work especially apply to night work and are mainly attributable to circadian disharmony (√Ökerstedt, 1990; Costa, 1996; Smith et al., 2010). Night work disrupts the natural circadian rhythm because it requires people to be active at times when they would nor- mally be sleeping, and vice versa. During night work, adaptation in circadian rhythm is limited (Ferguson et al., 2012). As a consequence, performance decreases (Burgess et al., 2013) and many shift workers suffer from insufÔ¨Åcient and suboptimal sleep, resulting in incomplete recovery between shifts (Geurts et al., 2013). As feeling recovered is beneÔ¨Åcial for performance during the next work day (Volman et al., 2013) and recovery has been argued to be a vital link between demanding work characteris- tics and employee health (Geurts and Sonnentag, 2006), incomplete recovery could be an important factor in the associ- ation between shift work and a higher risk of accidents and ill health.  * Corresponding author.

The adverse effects of shift and night work could be particularly pronounced in the presence of additional demanding shift char- acteristics such as long work shifts (Rosa, 1995), varying workload that is either too low or too high causing passivity or high strain (Karasek, 1979), and high emotional (Maslach, 1982) and cognitive demands (Paas et al., 2003). These demands may deplete energy resources and thereby intensify the load effects and negative emotions caused by work stressors (Zohar et al., 2003). Such a combination of demanding shift work characteristics can be ex- pected among employees working for ambulatory emergency ser- vices. In the current study, we examine a national population of such employees, that is, pilots working for the Dutch Helicopter Emergency Medical Service (HEMS). HEMS provides 24/7 on-scene assistance to trauma patients. To provide this assistance, HEMS employees work a compressed work schedule of circa 40 h in three consecutive day or night shifts, with at least three free days be- tween the series of shifts. HEMS pilots do not work a Ô¨Åxed pattern in the sequence of a series of day and night shifts, but generally their series of day and night shifts are alternated. The duration of one shift is long: almost 13 h with a maximum duration of 15.5 h per shift. During their shifts, they are called upon when an emer- gency happens and this makes their workload highly variable and unpredictable. During a mission, pilots are continuously inter- preting information and making decisions that require high cognitive effort (Watson et al., 1996). In addition, HEMS employees are confronted with high emotional demands as they often  0003-6870/$ e see front matter √ì 2013 Elsevier Ltd and The Ergonomics Society.

It is possible for HEMS employees to sleep during night shifts when they are not called upon. The aim of the current study is to examine the effects of a compressed working week with high cognitive and emotional work demands in relation to well-being and recovery within the popu- lation of HEMS pilots. Although there are studies examining the economic costs and beneÔ¨Åts of HEMS as a facility (for a review see Taylor et al., 2010), studies examining well-being and recovery of HEMS pilots themselves are rare. To our knowledge, this is the Ô¨Årst study to examine well-being and recovery in this population. Four focal issues are central in this paper: (1) well-being at the start of a series of shifts, (2) well-being during a shift, (3) work characteris- tics and well-being during a shift, and (4) recovery after a series of shifts.  1.1. Well-being at the start of a series of shifts  Dutch HEMS personnel start their day shifts at 6:30 AM and their night shifts at 6:30 PM. The early start of day shifts requires an advancing of the body‚Äôs timing system while the start of a series of night shifts requires a delaying of the body‚Äôs timing system. Research shows that advancing, instead of delaying the body‚Äôs timing system, is associated with more health complaints such as head-ache, irritability, gastrointestinal disorders, fatigue and loss of concentration (Waterhouse et al., 1997). Therefore, we expect that the start of a series of day shifts is associated with lower levels of well-being. More precisely, we hypothesize that at the start of a series of day shifts, well-being is lower than in the morning on a preceding day off. The start of a series of night shifts is not associ- ated with lower levels of well-being when compared to levels of well-being on the evening of a preceding day off (Hypothesis 1).  strongly associated to a decrease in well-being than during day shifts (Hypothesis 3).  1.4.  Recovery after a series of shifts  Over the last decades, awareness has risen that recovering from stress, during work or leisure, is important to preserve performance (Volman et al., 2013) and health (Geurts and Sonnentag, 2006). The small adaptations in circadian rhythm during night work (Ferguson et al., 2012) could result in a longer time needed to recover from a series of night shifts than from a series of day shifts. This longer recovery time could explain the adverse effects of night work (√Ökerstedt, 1990; Costa, 1996; Smith et al., 2010), as slow and incomplete recovery impedes health and well-being (Meijman and Mulder, 1998). Our fourth hypothesis states that HEMS pilots need a longer time to recover from a series of night shifts than from a series of day shifts (Hypothesis 4).  2. Method  2.1.  Participants  All 27 employees working for the Dutch HEMS were approached for participation. During an introductory meeting, the general purpose of the study and the importance of participation were explained to the HEMS employees. Twenty-four employees agreed to participate (89% of the total population). The data of 23 em- ployees will be reported because one employee took part in a pilot study to test the procedure. Mean age of the participants was 44.1 years (SD ¬º 5.97) and one of them was female. All participants had a college or university degree. In a compressed work schedule par- ticipants worked 37.7 contractual hours per week (SD ¬º 1.39), with a minimum of 32 h and a maximum of 39 h.  1.2. Well-being during a shift  2.2.  Procedure  Empirical literature on long work hours has shown that long shifts increase fatigue and cause a higher risk of accidents and reduce performance (Rosa, 1995). Previous research has shown that these disadvantages seem to be most pronounced for night shifts (Smith et al., 1998; Rosa, 1995) and toward the end of long shifts (Folkard, 1997). As HEMS personnel work day and night shifts of almost 13 h, we expect a signiÔ¨Åcant decrease in well-being during individual shifts (Hypothesis 2a), and a higher decrease in well- being during night shifts when compared to day shifts (Hypothe- sis 2b).  1.3. Work characteristics and well-being during a shift  The decrease in well-being during shifts is not only determined by the length of a shift, but also by the work content and experi- ences during a shift. HEMS pilots can be expected to face relatively demanding work characteristics such as highly variable and un- predictable workload and emotional stressors. In previous research, such demanding work characteristics have been associated with low levels of well-being (de Jonge et al., 2008; Van der Doef and Maes, 1999). Moreover, the cognitive-energetic model of affective reactions posits that negative emotions following disruptive events are intensiÔ¨Åed when limited energy resources are available (Zohar et al., 2003). As night shifts cause a signiÔ¨Åcant loss in sleep and deplete energy resources (Rosa, 1995), the negative emotions caused by work stressors could be intensiÔ¨Åed during the night. Therefore, our third hypothesis states that during night shifts, job stressors (workload as well as distress during shifts) are more  For a schematic overview of the procedure see Fig. 1. Two to three weeks before a random series of day or night shifts, partici- pants received an e-mail in which they were informed in detail about the study procedure. This e-mail included an overview of the measurement dates and an individual log-in code to complete online questionnaires. Participants were also invited to complete the online general questionnaire with questions concerning age, gender, education level and contract hours. When the participants agreed with the measurement dates, they received a tailor-made time schedule of their individual measurement occasions. Before, during and after a series of day and night shifts, partic- ipants completed short online questionnaires measuring daily well-being, number of Ô¨Çight missions, workload and distress dur- ing shifts. During night shifts, on-job sleep quality was also measured. To be more precise, daily well-being was measured in the morning and evening on a free day (1 day*2 measurements) before a series of three consecutive shifts. During a series of shifts, participants completed a short questionnaire both at the start and at the end of each shift (3 days*2 measurements). Daily well-being was measured at the start and the end of each shift whereas number of Ô¨Çight missions, workload and distress during shifts were measured at the end of a shift. On-job sleep quality was only measured at the end of a night shift. After a series of shifts, daily well-being was measured in the morning and evening on two consecutive free days (2 days*2 measurements). This makes a total of 12 measurements of daily well-being and three measurements of number of Ô¨Çight missions, workload and distress during shifts. Because the same procedure was followed for a series of day and night shifts, the total number of measurements of daily well-being

Schematic overview of the procedure.  was 24 and number of Ô¨Çight missions, workload and distress during shifts were measured six times. Participants received an e-mail with a link to the questionnaire at the exact moment when they had to complete the questionnaire. In addition, participants received a text message on their cell phones to remind them to Ô¨Åll out the questionnaire. One and a half hour after sending the e-mail and text message, it was checked whether participants had completed the questionnaire. If they had not, they received a second text message wherein they were reminded to complete the questionnaire. After participants Ô¨Ålled out the last questionnaire, they were thanked for their participation and informed when preliminary results were expected. This pro- cedure resulted in a total score of 99% completed questionnaires. The only two questionnaires that were not completed were a questionnaire at the end of night shift two and a questionnaire at the end of night shift three. The data were collected from March to August 2012.  2.3.3. Workload  Workload was measured six times using the following item: ‚ÄòHow busy were you during the shift?‚Äô, and rated on a 10-point Likert scale (1 ¬º not busy at all, 10 ¬º very busy).  2.3.4. Distress during the shift  Distress during shifts was measured six times using the following item: ‚ÄòHow distressing was your shift?‚Äô. The item was rated on a10-point Likert scale (1 ¬º not distressing at all, 10 ¬º much  distressing).  2.3.5. On-job sleep quality  On job-sleep quality was measured after each night shift resulting in a total of three measurements. Participants indicated on a 10-point Likert scale (1 ¬º extremely poor 10 ¬º extremely good) how well they slept during the night shift by answering the ques- tion: ‚ÄòHow well did you sleep during your shift?‚Äô.  2.3. Measures  2.4.  Statistical analyses  For daily measurements, we adapted response-scales based on the basic Dutch grade notation system ranging from 1 (extremely low/negative) to 10 (extremely high/positive) and anchored the Ô¨Årst and the last grade. The Dutch grade system considers a six as the lowest satisfactory score and a score below six is considered ‚Äòunsatisfactory‚Äô. Single-item measures were used to minimize the effort required from the participants and maximize user- friendliness. When one-dimensional unambiguous constructs are measured, single-item measures are a legitimate alternative to multiple-item measures (e.g. Van Hooff et al., 2007). The wording and face validity of the items were discussed with peer researchers and the participant who took part in the pilot study and a few ambiguous items were reformulated.  2.3.1. Daily well-being  Well-being was measured 24 times using six items. These items were adapted from the Health & Well-being measurement used by De Bloom et al. (2013). The items were: ‚ÄòAt this moment, I feel [energetic] [happy] [relaxed] [tired] [stressed out] [irritated]. Items were rated on a 10-point Likert scale (1 ¬º not at all, 10 ¬º very much). The items [tired] [stressed out] and [irritated] were reverse scored and a mean well-being score was calculated per measurement moment. The items showed good reliability (Cronbach‚Äôs a ¬º 0.67e 0.92, # of Cronbach‚Äôs a < 0.75 ¬º 4, # of Cronbach‚Äôs a > 0.75 ¬º 20).  2.3.2. Number of Ô¨Çight missions  Participants indicated per shift how much Ô¨Çight missions they had, by answering the question: ‚ÄòHow many times did you actually Ô¨Çy during your shift?‚Äô Number of Ô¨Çight missions was measured six times.  The Ô¨Årst hypothesis e at the start of a series of day shifts, well- being is lower than in the morning on a preceding day off, whereas the start of a series of night shifts is not associated with a decrease in well-being e was examined using a 2 (Day shifts: well-being at a free morning before a series of day shifts vs. well-being at the start of a series of day shifts)  2 (Night shifts: well-being at a free evening before a series of night shifts vs. well-being at the start of a series of night shifts) repeated measures analysis of variance (RM- ANOVA). A signiÔ¨Åcant interaction effect would indicate that the development of well-being, from a free day before a series of shifts to the start of a series of shifts, differed between day and night shifts. Post-hoc paired t-tests were used to further explore a sig- niÔ¨Åcant interaction effect. The second hypothesis e well-being decreases during individual day and night shifts with a higher decrease in well-being during night shifts e was examined using paired t-tests. Levels of well- being at the start of each shift were compared to levels of well- being at the end of each shift. To examine whether the decrease in well-being during night shifts is signiÔ¨Åcantly higher than during day shifts, difference scores were calculated for each day shift (well-being at the end of a day shift e well-being at the start of a day shift) and each night shift (well-being at the end of a night shift e well-being at the start of a night shift). These difference scores for day and night shifts were compared using paired t-tests. The third hypothesis e a stronger association between job stressors and decreases in well-being during night shifts than during day shifts e was examined using multilevel analysis. Multilevel analysis is a very useful analysis method for repeated measures because it corrects for the correlations between mea- surements within individuals (Hox, 2010). MLwiN 2.23 was used to  
M. Radstaak et al.  / Applied Ergonomics 45 (2014) 986e993  989  conduct the analysis and all variables were standardized. Because we were interested in the decrease in well-being during a shift, we added well-being at the start of a shift as a covariate and well-being at the end of the shift was the dependent variable. Other covariates were number of Ô¨Çight missions and sleep quality (only for night shifts). Because the number of participants was small and we did not want to lose too much power, we had to be parsimonious in the estimated parameters. Therefore, we did not estimate the covari- ance parameters between day and night shifts which reduced the estimated parameters with nine (3 day shifts  3 night shifts). We also assumed that the association between the independent vari- ables and the dependent variable was the same during the three day shifts and during the three night shifts. By this means we reduced the estimated parameters with a factor three for day and night shifts: Ô¨Åve parameters estimates instead of Ô¨Åfteen for day shifts (reduction of 10) and six parameter estimates instead of eighteen for night shifts (reduction of 12). Thus, in total we added thirty-one degrees of freedom per multilevel model. To examine whether the associations between job stressors and well-being differed for day and night shifts, three models were deÔ¨Åned. Model A assumed that the associations between job stressors and well-being were different for day and night shifts. Model B assumed that the associations between workload and well-being were the same for day and night shifts. Model C assumed that the associa- tions between distress during shifts and well-being were the same for day and night shifts. When Model B and/or C showed a decrease in model Ô¨Åt, the associations between job stressors and well-being for day and night shifts were considered to be different. The decrease of model Ô¨Åt was examined using c2-test. To examine the fourth hypothesis e it takes a longer time to recover from a series of night shifts than from day shifts e we applied four steps. First, we calculated a baseline score for well-being before a series of day shifts by averaging levels of well-being on a free morning before a series of day shifts and levels of well-being on a free evening before a series of day shifts. The same method was used to calculate baseline levels of well-being before a series of night shifts. Second, we calculated the standard deviations for these two vari- ables. Third, we estimated per participant how many hours it took them to recover after a series of day and night shifts. Participants were considered to be recovered when their levels of well-being was at minimum a half standard deviation below their baseline level of well-being. This means that during day shifts, it took participants 12 h to recover when well-being reached baseline levels in the morning after a series of day shifts. It took them 24 h to recover when well-being reached baseline levels in the evening after a series of day shifts and it took hem 36 h to recover when well-being reached baseline levels the second morning after a series of day shifts. The same method was applied to night shifts. It took participants 12 h to recover when they reached baseline levels of well-being the evening after a series of night shifts. When levels of well-being reached baseline levels the free morning after a series of night shifts, it took participants 24 h to recover. It took them 36 h to recover when they reached baseline levels of well-being in the evening of a free day. Because our recovery measurements were limited to a period of 36 h after the series of shifts, we assumed that it took participants 48 h to recover when they were not recovered within 36 h. Fourth, a paired t-test was used to examine whether it took longer time to recover from night shifts as compared to day shifts.  3. Results  3.1.

Tables 3 and 4 show the crude correlations between well-being, on-job sleep quality (only during night shifts), number of Ô¨Çight missions, workload and distress during shifts for day shifts (Table 3) and night shifts (Table 4). Levels of well-being during day and night shifts are depicted in Fig. 2. The descriptives in Tables 1 and 2 and Fig. 2 show that in gen- eral, HEMS employees experienced high levels of well-being (Day shifts: M > 7.67; Night shifts M > 7.45). During their shifts, par- ticipants experienced moderate levels of workload (M range 3.41e 5.04) and low levels of distress (M < 3.09). Sleep quality during the night shift was satisfactory during the Ô¨Årst two night shifts (M > 6.0) but less satisfactory during the third night shift (M ¬º 5.86).  3.2.  Test of study hypotheses  3.2.1. Well-being at the start of a series of shifts (Hypothesis 1)  RM-ANOVA revealed a signiÔ¨Åcant interaction effect (F(1, 22) ¬º 5.19, p ¬º 0.033): the change in well-being from a free day before a series of shifts to the start of a series of shifts, differed between day and night shifts. Paired t-test showed that levels of well-being were lower at the start of a series of day shifts (M ¬º 7.91) when compared with levels of well-being at a free morning before a series of day shifts (M ¬º 8.36; t(22) ¬º 1.88, p ¬º 0.037). Levels of well-being at the start of a series of night shifts (M ¬º 8.13) did not a series of night shifts (M ¬º 7.90; t(22) ¬º  1.19, p ¬º 0.13). Our Ô¨Årst differ signiÔ¨Åcantly from levels of well-being at a free evening before hypothesis received support.  3.2.2. Decrease in well-being during a shift (Hypothesis 2a & 2b)  There was no signiÔ¨Åcant decrease in well-being during the Ô¨Årst day shift (Start M ¬º 7.91, End M ¬º 7.78, t(22) ¬º 0.19) or the second day shift (Start M ¬º 8.17, End M ¬º 7.83, t(22) ¬º 1.49, p ¬º 0.08). There was a signiÔ¨Åcant decrease in well-being during the third day shift (Start M ¬º 8.29, End M ¬º 7.67, t(22) ¬º 4.00, p < 0.001). Post-hoc analysis revealed that the signiÔ¨Åcant decrease in well-being dur- ing the third day shift is more attributable to the relatively high score of well-being at the start of the shift than to a low level of well-being at the end of the shift. The level of well-being at the start (t(22) ¬º  1.95, of p ¬º 0.032) than the level of well-being at the start of the Ô¨Årst day the third day shift was signiÔ¨Åcantly higher shift whereas the level of well-being at the end of the Ô¨Årst day shift did not differ from that at the end of the third day shift (t(22) ¬º 0.57, p ¬º 0.29). During all night shifts, Start M ¬º 8.13, levels of well-being signiÔ¨Åcantly End M ¬º 7.67, decreased (First night shift: t(22) ¬º 1.71, p ¬º 0.05; Second night shift: Start M ¬º 8.22, End M ¬º 8.00, t(20) ¬º 1.92, p ¬º 0.034; Third night shift: Start M ¬º 8.10,

Hypothesis 2a was thus supported for night shifts. It was partly supported for day shifts, as only during the third day shift participants showed a signiÔ¨Åcant decrease in well-being. Paired t-tests were used to examine Hypothesis 2b. The non- signiÔ¨Åcant decrease in well-being during the Ô¨Årst day shift (M ¬º  0.13) did not differ from the signiÔ¨Åcant decrease in well- (M ¬º  0.46, t(22) ¬º 1.25, being during the Ô¨Årst night shift p ¬º 0.12), just as the non-signiÔ¨Åcant decrease in well-being during the second day shift (M ¬º  0.34) did not differ from the signiÔ¨Åcant (M ¬º  0.21, decrease in well-being during the second night shift t(20) ¬º  0.44, p ¬º 0.33). Also, the signiÔ¨Åcant decrease in well-being during the third day shift (M ¬º  0.59) did not differ from the sig- niÔ¨Åcant decrease in well-being during the third night shift (M ¬º  0.66, t(20) ¬º .22, p ¬º 0.42). Hypothesis 2b was not supported because the decrease in well-being during day shifts did not differ from the decrease in well-being during night shifts.  3.2.3. Work stressors and well-being (Hypothesis 3)  Table 5 shows the estimates of the multilevel models for both day and night shifts with well-being at the end of a shift as dependent variable, well-being at the start of the shift, number of Ô¨Çight missions and sleep quality (only for night shifts) as covariates, and workload and distress during shifts as predictors. Model A shows that during day shifts, workload was signiÔ¨Åcantly associated with a decrease in well-being (b ¬º  0.50, p < 0.05). During night shifts, workload (b ¬º  0.27, p < 0.05) and distress during shifts (b ¬º  0.23, p < 0.05) were signiÔ¨Åcantly related to a decrease in well-being. Model B shows that model Ô¨Åt did not decline when the estimates of workload for day and night shifts were considered to be the same (c2(1) ¬º 1.83, p ¬º 0.18). This suggests that the effects of workload on decrease in well-being during day and night shifts were comparable. Model C shows that model Ô¨Åt did signiÔ¨Åcantly decline when the estimates for distress during shifts during day and (c2(1) ¬º 3.99, night shifts were considered to be the same p ¬º 0.046). This result, combined with the Ô¨Ånding that distress during shifts was signiÔ¨Åcantly related to lower levels of well-being only during night shifts and not during day shifts, suggests that the  Table 3 Crude correlations between well-being, number of Ô¨Çight missions, workload and distressing shifts during day shifts.  1. 2. 3. 4. 5.

Thus, hypothesis 3 did not receive support for workload but was supported for distress during shifts.  3.2.4.  Recovery time (Hypothesis 4)  It took HEMS pilots more hours to recover after a series of night (M ¬º 19.83, SD ¬º 10.62) shifts than after a series of day shifts (M ¬º 15.13, SD ¬º 8.26, t(22) ¬º  1.99, p ¬º 0.030). Accordingly hy- pothesis 4 was supported.  4. Discussion  This study‚Äôs aim was to examine the effect of a compressed working week with high cognitive and emotional work demands in relation to well-being and recovery within the population of HEMS pilots. Not only is research examining well-being and recovery among HEMS pilots rare, this study also adds to the understanding of the effects of compressed work weeks and demanding work characteristics on well-being and recovery. In support of our Ô¨Årst hypothesis, results revealed that the start of a series of day shifts was more taxing for well-being than the start of a series of night shifts. This Ô¨Ånding is in line with earlier research showing that advancing, instead of delaying the body‚Äôs timing system, is associated with more health complaints (Waterhouse et al., 1997). It also suggests that HEMS personnel could be more fatigued and at risk for accidents at the early start of their day shifts. A reason that employees feel fatigued at a very early-in-the-morning start of the workday is that they sleep less hours in the preceding night (√Ökerstedt et al., 2010). Advancing the bedtime in order to sleep 8 h anyway, does not guarantee a good night sleep because most people cannot sleep when they go to bed earlier. The few hours prior to the onset of the nocturnal sleep period has even been referred to as the ‚Äòforbidden zone‚Äô for sleep (Lavie, 1986). During this time period, sleep propensity is markedly reduced due to a wake-promoting signal generated by the  Table 4 Crude correlations between well-being, number of Ô¨Çight missions, workload and distressing shifts during night shifts.  1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6.

An alterna- tive approach could be to postpone the start of the day shifts. Delaying the start of a workday has a strong impact on sleep length, with 70% of the extra time used for sleep (Ingre et al., 2008). However, delaying the start of the day shifts also implies that the end of the night shifts needs to be delayed which might increase levels of fatigue at the end of the night shifts. Against this back- ground, it could be considered to start day shifts somewhat (but not much) later, for example at 7.00 AM instead of at 6.30 AM. It cannot be recommended to start day shifts earlier than 6.30 AM. Our second hypothesis was partly supported. HEMS employees did report a signiÔ¨Åcant decrease in well-being during their night shifts and during the third day shift. This Ô¨Ånding, combined with Ô¨Åndings from earlier shift research (Folkard, 1997; Smith et al., 1998; Rosa, 1995), suggests that, especially during night shifts, HEMS employees could be more fatigued at the end of a shift which could reduce performance and increase the risk of accidents. The decrease in well-being during the third day shift is mainly attrib- utable to the relatively high well-being score at the start of that shift. Possibly this increase in well-being could be due to the adaptation of the body‚Äôs timing system to the earlier wake times which made it easier for HEMS employees to go to sleep and get up early. Although night shifts did cause a signiÔ¨Åcant decrease in well- being during all three shifts, the decrease in well-being was not  signiÔ¨Åcantly higher than during day shifts. This Ô¨Ånding is not in line with previous research that consistently showed the higher burden of night shifts when compared to day shifts (Costa, 1996). An explanation for this paradox could be the opportunity of HEMS pilots to sleep during night shifts when they are not called-upon. Power naps during night shifts have been shown to partially off- set the negative effects of night work (Tucker, 2003). Even though the decrease in well-being during shifts did not differ between day and night shifts, after-effects did differ. The results with respect to our fourth hypothesis showed that it took HEMS pilots a longer time to recover from a series of night shifts than from a series of day shifts. As Effort-Recovery theory posits that health is at risk when recovery is slow and incomplete (Meijman and Mulder, 1998), it is possible that in the long run this longer recovery time caused by demanding night work is a risk factor for ill health. In line with our expectations and previous research (Zohar et al., 2003), distress during shifts was more strongly related to a decrease in well-being during night shifts than during day shifts, even though levels of distress during night shifts were actually lower than during day shifts (see Table 2). Other occupations such as nurses or police ofÔ¨Åcers face emotional demands during the night as well. These results suggest that these nightly emotional demands might cause a higher burden for them too. Future research could examine whether these results apply to other  Day shifts  Morning  Evening  9  8.5  8  7.5  7  6.5  6  Night shifts  Morning  Evening  9  8.5  8  7.5  7  6.5  6  Free Shift 1Shift 2Shift 3 Free after 1  Free after 2  Free Shift 1Shift 2Shift 3 Free after 1  Free after 2  Fig. 2.

HEMS pilots reported low levels of distress during their shifts even though they are regularly confronted with emotionally demanding situations such as driving accidents (Blau et al., 2012). It is possible that their demanding work causes a selection for more resilient or hardy persons (Semmer, 2003), in other words, contribute to a healthy worker effect (Shah, 2009). It is also possible that HEMS employees learned to cope with emotional situations, for instance, by withdrawing from the trauma scene as they themselves do not need to give medical assistance. Future research could examine whether such person characteristics or behaviors are related to these low levels of distress.  4.1.  Strengths and limitations  A strength of this study is that our sample covered almost the entire population of HEMS pilots in the Netherlands. Nearly all HEMS employees agreed to participate and there was no attrition: none of the participants dropped out during the study. In addition, the response rate was about complete with 99% completed ques- tionnaires. This low level of attrition is probably due to the proper introduction of the study, and also to the short and user-friendly questionnaires that we designed with unambiguous and straight- forward items to measure our constructs. The limited selection bias and the absence of attrition support the validity of our results. Another strength is that we also measured well-being during free time. Effort-recovery research presupposes adequate data collec- tion during work, as well as before and after work, and we did not restrict the measures of well-being to the series of shifts. Finally, our data collection period covered a substantial part of the year. This makes it unlikely that our results were inÔ¨Çuenced by speciÔ¨Åc holidays or weather conditions. Research in applied psychology is challenging and complex, because researchers have limited control over the research condi- tions in natural settings (GrifÔ¨Åths, 1999), and we too had to make some concessions in designing our study. To minimize the inter- ference with daily and nightly working life we limited our mea- surement method to self-reports. Data triangulation, for example, the combination of self-reports with biological measures of stress or valid measures of performance, for example, standardized tests of executive functioning, would be a means to further improve the knowledge about the effects of shift work. Another limitation is that, in our measure of distress during shifts, we did not disen- tangle the ‚Äòobjective‚Äô and ‚Äòsubjective‚Äô experience of distress during the shifts (see also Kompier, 2005). Because we asked participants to report their subjective experience of distress during the shifts, we cannot conclude to what extent the actual distressing events affected well-being, or whether also other factors were involved inÔ¨Çuencing the perception of distress such as job satisfaction. We also could not fully counterbalance the sequences of the series of day and night shifts. Nine pilots completed their measurements starting with a series of night shifts followed by a series of day shifts, whereas 14 pilots started with a series of day shifts followed by a series of night shifts. However, it is unlikely that the sequences of shifts have inÔ¨Çuenced our results because there was at least three free days between the series of shifts, making it improbable that there were spillover-effects from one series of shifts to another. A last limitation is that our cut off point (>M   0.5 SD) for considering pilots to be recovered was somewhat arbitrary. However, when a stricter cut off point was used in a sensitivity analysis (>M   0.25 SD), the results remained the same. It still took pilots a longer time to recover from night shifts than from day shifts (Day shifts: M ¬º 17.22, SD ¬º 10.12; Night shifts: M ¬º 22.24, SD ¬º 13.20; t(22) ¬º  1.80, p ¬º 0.044).  4.2.  Conclusion  This study was one of the Ô¨Årst to examine the effects of a compressed working week with high cognitive and emotional de- mands in relation to recovery and well-being among HEMS pilots. Their relatively high levels of well-being suggest that they feel competent to do their job even in the face of demanding work characteristics. Although general levels of well-being were high, day and night shifts had differential effects on well-being. When compared to a free morning, well-being was lower at the start of the series of day shifts, possibly due to sleep deÔ¨Åcit. In general, compressed work weeks with demanding work characteristics caused the highest burden during the night. Each night shift caused a signiÔ¨Åcant decrease in well-being, subjective sleep quality decreased during the series of night shifts and it took a longer time to recover from a series of night shifts. In addition, distressing shifts caused a higher decrease in well-being during night shifts than during day shifts. It is concluded that from an occupational health and performance perspective, it would not be warranted for HEMS employees to start earlier during day shifts, or to have longer series of night shifts. It is also important to guarantee enough recovery time after a series of night shifts.  ConÔ¨Çicts of interest and source of funding  There were no conÔ¨Çicts of interest.

s0003687013002718,": Back problems  are a major occupational health issue for prehospital emergency care professionals. The goals of this article are to: 1) provide descriptive data about the prevalence and the severity of lower back and upper back disorders in EMTs and paramedics; 2) identify some individual and collective strategies used by EMTs and paramedics to protect their health as they perform prehospital emergency missions; 3) assess the possible effectiveness of strategies in preventing back problems by exploring associations between the use of strategies and the presence and severity of symptoms. Material and methods: The method includes a questionnaire survey (sample n ¬º 334; paramedics and emergency medical technicians) and ergonomics work practice analysis involving shadowing ambulance crews in 12 medical emergency services (over 400 h). Results: A majority of ambulance professionals had experienced back pain in the twelve-month period before the survey. Work practice analysis revealed strategies and tricks of the trade used by ambulance professionals to reduce the chances of back strain while working. Multiple regression analyses showed that self-reported use of such strategies was associated with fewer back symptoms. strategies should be integrated into specialised training programs for pre- hospital medical emergency professionals. This approach could also be used in other work settings. √ì 2014 Elsevier Ltd and The Ergonomics Society. All rights reserved.  Conclusions: Preventive  1.    There is evidence suggesting that occupational health problems are a major issue for emergency medical technicians (EMTs) and paramedics. For example, these professions have a high reported rate of retirement on medical grounds (Rodgers, 1998a) which may well be the consequence of deleterious working conditions. Musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs), chieÔ¨Çy chronic back pain, seem to be particularly prevalent in workers providing prehospital emergency care (Maguire et al., 2005). In EMTs and paramedics, they are the cause for 47% of early retirements on medical grounds (Rodgers, 1998b), affect a large proportion of ambulance pro- fessionals (Hogya and Ellis, 1990) and are a major reason for seeking medical help (Sterud et al., 2008).

Therefore, the onset of chronic MSDs often entails long absences and high risks of permanent work incapacity for the affected workers. Better understanding the issue of MSDs in EMTs and paramedics is crucial for developing, implementing and assessing the effectiveness of adequate preventive measures. However, recent literature reviews have concluded that little attention has been focused on this topic (Broniecki et al., 2010) and that most studies relied on small or convenient samples (Sterud et al., 2006) implying diverse potential selection biases. Therefore, comparative data about the prevalence and the severity of lower back and upper back disorders in EMTs and paramedics is clearly needed. Providing such data was one of the goals for our article. Health consequences of deleterious working conditions are affected by diverse individual and organizational factors. The mechanisms which lead to these factors having protective effects are not clear and better understanding them might provide key knowledge for the prevention of MSDs.

1004  M. Arial et al.  / Applied Ergonomics 45 (2014) 1003e1009  mechanisms might be identiÔ¨Åed through an examination of behavioral strategies developed by workers to best carry out their jobs. These strategies are a common concept in ergonomics and they refer to series of actions or behaviors used by workers to reach a speciÔ¨Åc goal (Faye and Falzon, 2009). In this article, we investigate the use of such smart practices by EMT and paramedics to protect their health in carrying out prehospital emergency missions, and we explore some quantitative and qualitative evidence supporting the effectiveness of these strategies. In summary, the goals of this article are to:  2.  1. provide descriptive data about the prevalence and the severity of lower back and upper back disorders in EMTs and paramedics; identify some individual and collective strategies used by EMTs and paramedics to protect their health as they perform pre- hospital emergency missions; 3. assess the possible effectiveness of strategies in preventing back problems by exploring associations between the use of strate- gies and the presence and severity of symptoms.  2. Material and methods  We performed an occupational health study on a large sample of ambulance professionals. We invited all the EMTs and paramedics working in the French-speaking part of Switzerland to participate in a questionnaire survey and carried out a work practice analysis in ambulance services. Ambulance professionals in Switzerland are employed by hospitals, private services, or public agencies. Their work consists of the following: performing rescue operations; providing prehospital emergency care to patients requiring their assistance; and transporting patients to the hospital when neces- sary. They also perform other types of patient transport (e.g., from one hospital to another). Ambulance crews usually consist of two people, but missions occasionally involve medical teams (e.g., emergency physician and emergency nurse).  2.1. Questionnaire study  The target population and study sample have been presented previously (Arial et al., 2011). In summary, we contacted all 32 emergency medical care services in the French-speaking part of Switzerland. Twenty-seven services (84%) accepted the invitation to participate and provided the researchers with lists of the names and email addresses of their employees. Among the services which accepted to participate to the study, 44% were independent private services, 30% belonged to hospitals, and 26% were linked to diverse organizations (e.g., Ô¨Åre department, police, and airport emergency services). The questionnaire took approximately 45 min to com- plete. Questionnaires were sent to all (n ¬º 669) employees of those services. Participants who were not EMTs or paramedics were excluded from our analysis. Arrangements were made with the employers to allow their employees to answer the questionnaire during working hours (i.e., waiting time between missions). We offered the option of answering the questionnaire on paper or on- line. After completion paper questionnaires were returned by means of a prepaid envelope. When using the on-line version, participants had the opportunity to leave the session and log in again later without losing data entered during the previous session. We used a French version of the Nordic Questionnaire (Dickinson et al., 1992; Kuorinka et al., 1987) to acquire the infor- mation on musculoskeletal symptoms. This questionnaire has been used in several professions such as nurses (Smith et al., 2004), computer users (Brisson et al., 1999; Bergqvist et al., 1995; Cook  et al., 2000), forestry workers (Hagen et al., 1998) or coopers (Macdonald and Waclawski, 2006). This questionnaire is repeat- able, sensitive and appears to be appropriate as a screening tool (Crawford, 2007). It is also reported as a valid tool for monitoring diverse work-related MSDs in epidemiologic studies (Descatha et al., 2007; Perreault et al., 2008). We considered symptoms (pain or discomfort) affecting 2 anatomical regions: 1) lower-back, and 2) neck-shoulder-upper-back. Symptoms were assessed for duration and severity separately for each anatomical region considered. The rating procedure for the duration of discomfort/ pain to both the anatomical regions considered is as follows: (0) no pain or discomfort in previous 12 months, (1) pain or discomfort experienced 1e7 days in previous 12 months, (2) pain or discomfort experienced 8e30 days in previous 12 months, (3) pain or discomfort experienced more than 30 days in previous 12 months. Severity: We choose not to use the standardized procedure included in the Nordic Questionnaire to measure the severity of symptoms. Instead, respondents reporting symptoms (pain or discomfort) to the lower-back region or the neck-shoulder-upper- back region within the twelve months before answering the questionnaire were asked to rate its peak episode on a scale ranging from 0 - ‚Äúno pain at all‚Äù to 10 ‚Äúunbearable pain‚Äù). This scale is well- known and widely used by EMTs and paramedics in Switzerland. It is particularly used as an aid to estimating the pain patients are suffering and whether to inject a quick-acting narcotic analgesic (i.e. Fentanyl). We choose this formulation because ambulance professionals who pretested our questionnaire spontaneously transcribed our formulation into their more usual one (0e10). Strategies: respondents were asked whether they agreed with the following sentence: ‚ÄúWith my work experience, I developed and learned some tricks of the trade helping me to spare my health‚Äù. The coding is as follows: (1) totally disagree, (2) rather disagree, (3) rather agree, and (4) totally agree. Answers (1) and (2) were grouped for the purposes of our analyses. The survey also included a variety of other categories of ques- tions (on mental health, effort-reward imbalance, types of mission, average weekly number of missions, etc.) covered in another article on the association of different stressors with mental health in- dicators in EMTs and paramedics (Arial et al., 2011).  2.1.1.  Statistical analysis  Descriptive statistics were used to describe participants‚Äô an- swers on demographics, self-reported symptoms and self-reported use of preventive strategies. The self-reported health outcomes (severity and duration of symptoms to lower-back and neck- shoulder-upper-back regions) were analysed using an ordered lo- gistic regression, also called proportional odds model (ologit command in STATA) owing to the ordinal nature of these two variables. Ordered logistic regression generalizes logistic regres- sion, in that the dependant variable is not binary but ordinal. The coefÔ¨Åcients of this regression can also be interpreted as a summary of J logistic regressions if the dependant variable has J √æ 1 possible outcomes (see for example Long and Freese, 2006). The parameters of ordered logistic regressions can therefore be interpreted as mean odds-ratios or log-odds-ratios, when dividing the dependant vari- able using the J different possible cutoffs. The main independent variable considered is variable coding the self-reported use of strategies for the prevention of back problems in three categories (rather disagree, agree, totally agree). These regression model were further adjusted on known determinants of back pain (gender, age and on professional category which were considered as a potential confounders). No post-hoc selection of covariables was applied. The analyses were performed with STATA software for Windows, release 12.0 (Stata corporation, College Station, TX, USA). For all statistical tests, an overall signiÔ¨Åcance level was set at P  0.05.  
The resulting four models are displayed at Table 2.  2.2.  Interviews and work practice analysis  We asked all 32 emergency medical care services located in the French-speaking part of Switzerland to let us carry out a work  practice analysis on them. Five of these services refused due to organizational changes they were undergoing at that time (i.e. service mergers). We subsequently selected a convenience sample of 12 services (among the remaining 27 services) in order to analyse work practices in a variety of contexts: different sized emergency medical care services; urban and non-urban environments; those  Table 1 Prevalence, severity, duration and associated medical care seeking of musculoskeletal problems among all Emergency Medical Technicians (EMTs) and paramedics from the French-speaking part of Switzerland (n ¬º 334).

We asked the emergency medical care service managers to suggest weeks when observations would be most feasible. We contacted potential participants by telephone or emails and asked ambulance professionals who were scheduled to work whether they would accept our presence with them. Nobody refused. By shadowing EMTs and paramedics in the selected services throughout whole work shifts (usually 12 h), we collected examples of preventive strategies using interviews and work practice anal- ysis. A total of 416 h of observation took place (one week per group, including day and night shifts). Observations and interviews were shared between three re- searchers (1 female, 2 males): a psychologist, an ergonomist, and a health and safety specialist. A pen and paper technique was used to record tasks performed by participants. When note-taking during a mission proved impossible, researchers wrote notes retrospectively at the end of the workday. We also used the ‚Äúsubsequent verbal- ization‚Äù technique (Leplat and Hoc, 1981): after missions, partici- pants were asked to explain the tasks they had just performed. For example, researchers asked them to explain what kind of problems they had encountered, how the actual mission had differed from what they had expected initially, their satisfaction regarding how the mission had gone, etc.). We recorded certain prehospital emergency missions on video, following a strict procedure. Both the professionals and the patients involved had to agree to the use of video and retained the option to ask the researcher to cease recording at any moment during the mission. We also identiÔ¨Åed diverse exclusion criteria: for example, we did not use the camera when patients were alcohol/drug impaired or unconscious (and therefore unable to give their informed consent). Video recordings were used in auto- confrontation interviews (during which participants are con- fronted with the video recording of their own work activity). This technique is useful for revealing the cognitive processes underlying the work activity (Mollo and Falzon, 2004). Descriptions of relevant video sequences and interview excerpts were written up by re- searchers. Analysis began with several readings of all the data. Preventive strategies were identiÔ¨Åed and discussed by a multidis- ciplinary team (consisting of the ergonomist, the psychologist, and the health and safety specialist). Strategies were grouped together a Ô¨Årst time and then all the data (video, interviews, written notes) were reviewed again in order to identify strategies that did not come to light during the Ô¨Årst analytical sessions carried out by the team. At the end of the project, the strategies were presented to a large audience (N ¬º 50) of EMTs and paramedics for validation purposes. No incentives were provided for participation. The study pro- tocol was submitted and approved by an independent ethical commission, and was in compliance with the Declaration of Helsinki.  3. Results  A total of 374 questionnaires were returned (56% response rate). Forty participants were excluded from our analysis because they were neither EMTs nor paramedics (most of excluded cases were emergency nurses or professional Ô¨ÅreÔ¨Åghters). Most participants were male (77%) and a majority were married or cohabitating (62%) and 40% had at least one child. Nearly half (49%) of participants were between 30 and 40 years old. Only 25% of participants were 40 or older. Respondents with 0e5 years of work experience in prehospital emergency care represented 28% of our sample. About 50% had more than Ô¨Åve and less than Ô¨Åfteen years of such work  experience. A large majority of participants are working full time (86%). More detailed demographics of the participants are available in (Arial et al., 2011). The median number of missions per week was 12 (p25 ¬º 7; p75 ¬º 16). Prehospital emergency missions represents most of missions performed by participants. For example, more than 40% of respondents mentioned that those missions represent at least 80% of the missions they usually perform. The Table 1 shows the prevalence, the duration, and severity of symptoms for both the anatomical regions considered, by known potential confounders and variables of interest. A majority (56%) of participants reported pain or discomfort (at least one day in the 12 months before answering the questionnaire) in at least one of the anatomic regions considered (lower-back re- gion; neck-shoulder-upper-back region). A total of 143 (43%) re- ported symptoms in both regions (data not shown in tables). Age and the number of years worked as an EMT or paramedic were highly correlated (r ¬º 0.74; p < 0.001). We decided to only include age in our multiple ordered logistic regression models in order to avoid interdependency between these two variables. Table 2 shows the association between our independent variable (self-reported use of preventive strategies) and self-reported health outcomes, controlled for age, gender and professional category. The dependent variables of symptom severity and symptom duration (in both anatomic regions) were negatively associated to health outcomes in three out of four models. In the fourth model, the level of association was close to signiÔ¨Åcant. Gender was sig- niÔ¨Åcant in only one model. Our analysis of EMTs and paramedics‚Äô work practices revealed several strategies that had good potential for preventing musculoskeletal problems to the lower-back region and neck- shoulder-upper-back region. The list of strategies we examine below is not exhaustive. Our goal is to give examples of some observed strategies and brieÔ¨Çy explain their relevance for pre- venting MSDs. We observed several strategies, many of them aimed at pro- tecting the back (mostly for the lumbar region). Table 3 displays some examples of such strategies. Several of the techniques taught in vocational training for EMTs and paramedics were applied in a variety of environments. EMTs and paramedics had also developed genuinely new strategies by adapting known principles for lifting and moving patients to the speciÔ¨Åc environments they met in prehospital settings. Examples included leaning and sliding the shoulder against the wall while carrying a stretcher in stairways. This allowed transferral of part of the weight to the wall, thus using it as a lateral support. The belt buckles were often used for sup- porting stretchers, allowing the distribution of weight between the lumbar region and the hips. Many strategies aimed at adapting and using the environment on site. Moving furniture and optimizing the environment around the patient were frequently done to avoid awkward postures. Medical intervention bags were often installed on a small table or directly on the patient‚Äôs bed in order to facilitate access to the material needed while providing care to the patient. Some participants also mentioned that they had added an extra step to their standard arrival procedure on a mission site: in addition to the usual assessment of the surroundings (e.g. potential dangers), and anticipating evacuation possibilities, they also assessed the postures they might have to adopt (and started thinking about how they could improve them). Awkward and constraining postures are therefore now among the potential haz- ards they consider at the very beginning of missions, allowing them to initiate preventive measures to bypass those postures. A signiÔ¨Åcant part of emergency response work is performed inside the ambulance itself. In Switzerland this corresponds to a relatively standardized and thus stable working environment. It is of note that many ambulances still have a bench seat in the medical

Most EMTs and paramedics used this seat instead of the one positioned at the head of the patient while providing care on the drive to the hospital (although the latter would be preferable for safety reasons). This choice was justiÔ¨Åed by practical reasons: easier access to most of the equipment and material stored in the medical compartment; the patient has a better view of the ambu- lance professionals face (making interactions more natural); communication with the driver is easier; access to any part of the patient‚Äôs body is easier should that be necessary, etc. For ambulance personnel however, this choice has important ramiÔ¨Åcations in terms of safety (especially in the case of a crash) and in terms of strenuous exertion for the back (there is no lateral support sitting perpendicularly to the road; limited space for the legs implies difÔ¨Åculties in adopting usual postural stabilization techniques; etc.). This seating arrangement increased the relevance of EMTs and paramedics using diverse, efÔ¨Åcient, posture stabilization strategies during the patient‚Äôs transfer to the hospital. Such strategies were needed in order to compensate for accelerations, decelerations and lateral vehicle movement. Examples included pushing one leg up against the stretcher or jamming a foot in the stretcher frame in order to provide more stability. These strategies are particularly crucial for performing delicate procedures (e.g., inserting an intravenous line) while the emergency vehicle is moving.  4. Discussion and conclusion  Major Ô¨Åndings: our study conÔ¨Årmed that MSDs are prevalent and represent a major occupational health issue for EMTs and paramedics. However, associations we observed between our in- dependent variable (self-reported use of preventive strategies) and dependent variables (self-reported health outcomes) suggest that prehospital emergency care professionals do develop strategies and tricks of the trade that appear to have a beneÔ¨Åcial effect on the number and severity of back problems. Our work practice analysis identiÔ¨Åed several strategies and tricks of the trade, most of which were aimed at avoiding awkward postures and easing the lifting/ carrying of patients (e.g., from the bed to the stretcher, from the stairway evacuation chair to the stretcher, or on the stretcher itself  in stairways). Very few strategies dealt with recuperating after heavy or strenuous physical effort. Strategies we identiÔ¨Åed seem to be relevant for preventing back problems. However, studies involving experimental validation of their effect in decreasing risk factors, as well as epidemiologic studies aiming at measuring their effect on long term occurrence and severity of symptoms are needed. They should also be assessed for other relevant aspects (i.e. patient‚Äôs safety, patient‚Äôs comfort, time needed to implement, etc). It is also important to mention that strategies we identiÔ¨Åed do not replace other preventive measures. For example, track-type stair descent devices or stretchers equipped with hydraulic lifting de- vices can have much more of an impact on biomechanical spine loads than can leaning against the wall when descending the stairs with a stretcher. However, we believe that behavioral strategies we identiÔ¨Åed could be combined with other ergonomic changes and might for example contribute to optimize the investment in new devices and technological improvements. Prevalence & severity: our results conÔ¨Årmed that back problems are a major issue for EMTs and paramedics. More than half of our participants reported symptoms in the neck-shoulder-upper-back region in the 12 months prior to answering the questionnaire. This proportion was even higher (about two-thirds) for the lower- back region. This is in line with results from an American study reporting a back pain incidence rate of more than 25% (Studnek and Crawford, 2007) and with a Swedish study reporting an overall prevalence of 47% for the upper-back and shoulder region, and 57% for lower-back region (Aasa et al., 2005). Our results on activity limitations were also comparable with the results of this Swedish study. A study of the main causes of early retirement on medical grounds (Rodgers, 1998a) suggested that there was a higher inci- dence of MSDs in female prehospital emergency care professionals than in males. Trends we observed in our study were in line with those Ô¨Åndings for the neck-shoulder-upper-back region, however this trend was not observed for the lower-back region. Reasons for such a discrepancy remain unknown and studies aimed at better understanding gender differences on this topic are needed. Our results showed that the prevalence of symptoms in the upper-back  
1008  M. Arial et al.  / Applied Ergonomics 45 (2014) 1003e1009  and lower-back regions was comparable for EMTs and paramedics. This contrasts with results from an American study (Hogya and Ellis, 1990) where differences very close to a signiÔ¨Åcant level (0.06) were observed. One possible explanation for this discrepancy between studies is that technicians and paramedics in Switzerland work in very close collaboration and often switch roles from one mission to the next. They therefore face the same exposure to back disorders and develop similar strategies to prevent them. This could explain the fact that the professional category was not a signiÔ¨Åcant variable in any of our four models. Strategies: we believe that the strategies we observed resulted from implicit preventive skills derived from a combination of vocational education and training, personal work experience, and shared working practices among emergency professionals. Basic notions about lifting and carrying patients, as well as anatomic and biomechanical principles are taught in initial and continuous ed- ucation for EMTs and paramedics. Those notions are deÔ¨Ånitely important for developing the preventive skills that lay behind the strategies we observed. We believe that increasing and improving teaching of those principles might enable EMTs and paramedics to develop and implement more and better adapted strategies. Nevertheless, transfer of training and generalization of such knowledge also require EMTs and paramedics to develop the necessary skills for analysing their own work practices (Faye and Falzon, 2009). To the best of our knowledge, the education and training which EMTs and paramedics receive does not involve learning activities aimed at developing those meta-skills. We believe that prevention of occupational back problems in pre- hospital medical care professionals would beneÔ¨Åt from combining teaching of anatomic and biomechanical principles, with learning activities aimed at the development of meta-skills for analysing work. Considering the number and variety of strategies we observed aimed speciÔ¨Åcally at preventing back problems it was striking to Ô¨Ånd so few centred on the optimization of recovery opportunities. The downtime between missions could be used as an opportunity for proactive recovery after strenuous effort. However, we observed no such strategies. In fact, we actually observed many aspects which might contribute to reducing the beneÔ¨Åts from potential recovery periods. For example, ofÔ¨Åce furniture used for adminis- trative work was usually shared by the employees on duty and seldom adapted to their speciÔ¨Åc morphology. Breaks were often taken in non-optimal environments (e.g., sofas fostering pelvic retroversion and general spinal kyphosis, uncomfortable seats in the hospital waiting room, sleeping on ‚Äúcamping‚Äù mattresses unrolled on the Ô¨Çoor of the ofÔ¨Åce during night shifts, etc.). We believe that identifying means to improve the possibilities for re- covery between missions is a relevant concern for most of the services where we performed observations. The present article focused on strategies and tricks of the trade that might contribute to the prevention of back problems in pre- hospital emergency workers. However, the strategies we observed also combined different goals: strategies and tricks of the trade used by EMTs and paramedics are also relevant for improving psychosocial aspects of work, increasing patient safety and enhancing the general quality and efÔ¨Åciency of the care provided (Arial and Beno√Æt, 2011). Those are key issues in emergency medical care and their corresponding strategies should be investigated in further studies. Associations: negative associations of our independent variable (self-reported use of preventive strategies) with the severity and duration of symptoms to lower-back and upper-back regions were signiÔ¨Åcant for most of the models we developed. This supports the idea that strategies used by workers might contribute to the pre- vention of work related back problems. To our knowledge, this is  the Ô¨Årst time that quantitative evidence has been provided sup- porting the preventive role of such strategies. Obviously, this conclusion has to be taken with caution because alternative ex- planations could result in the associations we identiÔ¨Åed. However, work practice analysis conÔ¨Årmed the presence of several strategies or tricks of the trade that appeared to reduce physical effort and awkward postures during prehospital emergency missions. Stra- tegies used by EMTs and paramedics seems to inÔ¨Çuence positively the prevention of occupational back problems. Development of learning activities targeting those strategies and tricks of the trade are clearly needed. The cross-sectional design we used for identi- fying associations between self-reported use of preventive strate- gies and health outcomes precluded any causal inference. In fact, reverse causation might have been an issue in our study because respondents without symptoms might have the impression that they have more or better strategies than the others. Reciprocal causation might also have been an issue as respondents with symptoms might have been more prone to implementing different strategies in order to cope with them, which in turn might have affected the severity or duration of symptoms. In this case however, the associations observed would have been less discernible. We therefore believe this issue was not really important in the present study. Measurement of the strategies we used relied on a single item based on self-reporting. This is a rather simplistic way to assess strategies; a different, more rigorous approach may be necessary. For example, a prospective study involving measure- ments based on scales assessing workers‚Äô, co-workers‚Äô or supervi- sors‚Äô opinions about the use of strategies might be relevant. The self-reported use of strategies could also be conÔ¨Årmed by ergo- nomic work practice analysis at an individual level. The prevalence of back problems we observed in EMTs and paramedics calls for effective preventive measures. The strategies and tricks of the trade we identiÔ¨Åed seems to be relevant for the prevention of back disorders. Teaching and training appear to be promising ways for EMTs and paramedics to learn the necessary skills to develop genuine preventive strategies and tricks of the trade of their own. Providing ergonomics training and education to workers is not a new approach in occupational health and ergo- nomics (Montreuil and Bellemare, 2001; Montreuil and Teiger, 1996). However, the content of ergonomics training is often based on a top down approach, providing the participants with evidence- based guidelines and recommendations. Another approach based on the type of strategies we described in this paper goes far beyond the approach described above. Providing the necessary skills to enable workers to diagnose their own work practices (and identify the strategies they implement), and using the results of their ana- lyses for educational purposes, is rather uncommon. However, our Ô¨Åndings in terms of strategies advocate strongly in favor of devel- oping preventive programs based on this approach. We recom- mend helping ambulance professionals to become specialists in the analysis of their own work practices in order to individually or collectively develop, confront, criticize and improve their strate- gies. We believe it would improve and help generalize knowledge of ergonomics in EMTs and paramedics, and therefore create a more durable effect on the prevention of back problems in those occu- pations. For EMTs and paramedics, prevention based on the type of strategies we observed, appears particularly relevant due to some of the important characteristics of these professions (unpredictable work environments, situations that are difÔ¨Åcult to anticipate, non redundancy of missions, waiting time that can be used for recovery purposes, etc.). Most of these characteristics are not limited to medical emergency work, and in fact recent developments in the socio-economic environment (subcontracting, rapid pace of change, frequent interruptions, etc.) have increased the pressure for workforce Ô¨Çexibility and adaptability. Workers must adapt

For example, the environment in which the work will take place, the time available to do the job, and even the tasks to be performed, are often unknown until the very last minute. This dramatically decreases the possibilities of antici- pating the constraints that employees will face at work, as well as the resources they will need to meet them. Approaches based on the preventive strategies that we have explored in this article, therefore appear to be promising solutions to these recent chal- lenges: they are suited to the emergency context. We also believe that their added value goes far beyond the prevention of back problems because they are relevant to crucial issues, such as acci- dent prevention at work, quality, system resilience, etc. Enabling and fostering the development of preventive strategies appears to be a novel, integrative approach for dealing with crucial issues in many professions.

s000368701300272x,"  FireÔ¨Åghting is one of the most hazardous occupations and is associated with exceedingly high rates of injuries. Average of 38,660 American Ô¨ÅreÔ¨Åghter injuries occurred at the Ô¨Åre site (Karter, 2012). Therefore, Ô¨ÅreÔ¨Åghters require not only good physical capa- bilities but also sufÔ¨Åcient mobility in their active work while Ô¨Åre- Ô¨Åghting at a high temperature and humidity with heavy personal protective equipment (PPE). PPE, which is composed of personal protective clothing (PPC) and accessories such as a self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA), helmet, mask, gloves and boots, is necessary to protect Ô¨ÅreÔ¨Åghters from various occupational hazards such as Ô¨Åre on the high-storied and sealed buildings. In this regard, the assessment of PPE in terms of wearer mobility, as well as pro- tective functions, is required. Although PPE aims to protect Ô¨Åre- Ô¨Åghters from physical and chemical harm, Ô¨ÅreÔ¨Åghters can become fatigued by impeded movement due to the weight and bulky nature of the multiple layers.  * Corresponding author.

Previous studies have reported that Ô¨ÅreÔ¨Åghters experienced phys- iological strain when performing at a simulated Ô¨Åre site and during Ô¨ÅreÔ¨Åghting activities with PPE in hot and humid environments (Griefahn et al., 2003; Bakri et al., 2012). However, relatively few studies have reported on mobility with different designs and weight of PPE during Ô¨ÅreÔ¨Åghting activities, and Range of motion (ROM) and subjective evaluations are generally used to assess mobility in previous studies. According to previous studies, ROM of each body part was changed due to PPE designs (Coca et al., 2008, 2010; Huck, 1988, 1991), and decreased by weight of PPE and fric- tion of wet PPE (Son et al., 2010). There are several international standards for evaluating Ô¨Åre- Ô¨Åghters‚Äô PPE, but these standards are merely assigned to the heat, Ô¨Çame, and water resistant properties of PPE (CEN TC 162, 2002; EN 469, 2005; ISO 11613, 1999). Furthermore, few test methods for assessing mobility while wearing PPE have been established (BS 8469, 2007; CEN TC 162, 2002). Without a standard method for mobility, the comparison of several types of PPE from different research groups may lead to inaccurate interpretations. Therefore, research on a standard method for assessing the mobility of PPE is required.  0003-6870/$ e see front matter Crown Copyright √ì 2014 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

1020  S.-Y. Son et al.  / Applied Ergonomics 45 (2014) 1019e1027  From the 1970s, many studies have been performed on Ô¨Åre- Ô¨Åghting drills which consist of dynamic movement such as ladder drill, pulling a hose, rescue, forcible entry, and stair climbing. These are carried out as essential movements for Ô¨ÅreÔ¨Åghting (Gledhill and Jamnik, 1992; Smith et al., 2001; Williford et al., 1999). However, the previous research groups have merely stud- ied the demands on Ô¨ÅreÔ¨Åghters using these movements. They reported the physiological responses of PPE wearers such as heart rate (HR) and metabolic demands. The mobility during Ô¨ÅreÔ¨Åghting drill was not evaluated in previous studies. Referring to survey of Japanese Ô¨ÅreÔ¨Åghters from Son et al. (2013), a large number of Ô¨ÅreÔ¨Åghters suffered injuries and restricted mobility due to failures in balance control (slips or falls) while wearing PPE. According to previous research, many Ô¨ÅreÔ¨Åghters have been injured by failing to control their balance (Karter, 2012). These reports suggest that a balance test with PPE is necessary. Therefore, for a standard method to evaluate mobility with different types of PPE, a com- bination of the physical performance test and functional balance test is required. Previous studies on PPE recruited Ô¨ÅreÔ¨Åghters as participants (Bos et al., 2004; Coca et al., 2010; Plat et al., 2010; Smith et al., 1997; Williford et al., 1999). Also, non-Ô¨ÅreÔ¨Åghters were asked to perform the experiment as subjects (Huck 1988, 1991). However, the physical demands and abilities of Ô¨ÅreÔ¨Åghters and untrained volunteers are not same, and Ô¨ÅreÔ¨Åghters are more used to working with PPE than untrained subjects. Therefore, the results of previous studies could not be compared absolutely. Regarding this, we were curious as to whether untrained males, especially students are appropriate to study of standard test method for mobility with PPE. To resolve this, comparison or evaluation of participant groups is also required. The pilot test method consisted of several measurements such as a physical performance test which was composed of a general physical Ô¨Åtness test and simple Ô¨ÅreÔ¨Åghting drills and the balance ability test, made for developing a standard test for assessing the mobility while wearing PPE in the present study. The aim of this study was to evaluate the current pilot test method and ascertain reliable measurements for developing a standard test method of mobility with PPE. The other aim was to compare two participant groups (Ô¨ÅreÔ¨Åghters versus non-Ô¨ÅreÔ¨Åghters) and to investigate  Table 1 SpeciÔ¨Åcations of three types of PPE.

s0003687013002731,"  Pedals are one of the most important controls used in vehicles. Only a few studies of the comfort of pedal operation have been reported in existing literature (see Haslegrave, 1995; Wang and Bullock, 2004). In our past studies (Wang et al., 2000, 2004), four design parameters of the clutch pedal (seat height, pedal travel length, pedal travel inclination, pedal resistance) were investigated to understand their effects on lower limb movements and pedal discomfort. The results from the biomechanical evaluation of comfort/discomfort are consistent with those from the subjective evaluation. Both agree with the principle of minimum work, observed in biomechanical analysis of leg movements. This is characterized by the preference of not raising the leg during the approach phase, and the preference of low joint work at the knee and hip during the depression phase. Although some design rec- ommendations for clutch pedal design were provided by this study, ergonomic criterion for pedal design which can be easily used by design engineers are still missing especially when one wants to optimise its position. Moreover, the conÔ¨Ågurations tested in our previous study (Wang et al., 2000, 2004) were not necessarily  * Corresponding author.

A central composite experimental design was used to reduce the number of test con- Ô¨Ågurations. Therefore, some combinations may not have been realistic. In addition, subjects were asked to freely place the clutch pedal without any restrictions related to the seat‚Äôs range of hori- zontal and vertical adjustments. The pedal positions tested in this study may not exist in real vehicles. Thanks to long experience in automotive engineering, currently existing pedals are generally well designed. Generally speaking from the design engineers‚Äô point of view, it is more critical to choose the best solution among already well designed ones than to distinguish a well-designed product from bad ones. Another motivation for this work was the development of digital human models (DHMs) for ergonomic design of products. DHMs became one of the key components of the CAD systems used in industry for product design and manufacturing (see Duffy, 2009 for an overview). In order to reduce design cycle and cost, it has become necessary to assess the ergonomics of a product in the very early stages of its development. Thanks to recent progress in mo- tion simulation, simulating a complex tasked orientated motion now becomes possible. But another challenging issue is how to assess motion related discomfort. We can mention some existing ergonomic assessment methods such as OWAS (Karhu et al., 1977), RULA (McAtamney and Corlett, 1993), REBA (Hignett and  0003-6870/$ e see front matter √ì 2014 Elsevier Ltd and The Ergonomics Society.

McAtamney, 2000) or OCRA (Occhipinti, 1998). Some of them are currently implemented in a DHM software package. However, these methods were developed by ergonomic experts for ergonomic assessment of working postures in industry and they can hardly be used by a design engineer to assess a product. In recent years, more and more researchers have become aware of the need for distinguishing comfort and discomfort (De Looze et al., 2003; Helander and Zhang, 1997; Kuijt-Evers et al., 2004; Moes, 2005). In particular, Helander and Zhang (1997) supported the claim that discomfort is related to biomechanical factors such as joint angles, joint torques and muscle forces, whereas comfort can be credited to a sense of well-being and aesthetics. Therefore biomechanical parameters may provide relevant insights for un- derstanding discomfort and developing motion related discomfort assessment modelling. Because any task oriented motion is more or less-constrained by the environment, a better comfort may be obtained when people can make their own appropriate adjustments. These less- constrained motions, also referred to as ‚Äúneutral‚Äù motions by Dufour and Wang (2005), can then be used as reference data for comparing a proposed solution and for identifying objective discomfort criterion based on biomechanical data. The purpose of this study is therefore to compare less-constrained clutching mo- tions with normally constrained ones in order to understand clutch pedal position adjustment and to explore whether it is possible to deÔ¨Åne objective discomfort assessment criteria for the clutch pedal operation that can be easily implemented in a DHM.  2. Materials and methods  2.1.  Participants  Twenty volunteer subjects took part in the experiment. They were divided into four anthropometric groups according to age and gender: 5 young females, 5 young males, 5 older females, 5 older  males. Due to small sample size, only the 50th percentile of each age-gender group in terms of stature was considered in order to keep a more homogeneous sample. All participants were regular drivers with a 2-year minimum driving experience and were in a good physical condition without joint trauma or diseases. The experimental protocol was approved by the ethical committee of IFSTTAR (French Institute of Science and Technology for Transport, Development and Networks). Informed consent was given before participating in the experiment. Forty one anthropometric dimensions were measured for all participants. Functional tests were performed on each subject in order to characterize joint ranges of motion and maximum iso- metric joint torques. The tests were selected according to their relevancy to clutch pedal operation. Therefore, maximum isometric joint torques and ranges of motion were collected only for the left lower limb. The active ranges of motion (ROM) mainly in the sagittal plane were measured for the left hip, knee and ankle joints. Maximum isometric joint torques were performed for these three joints only in Ô¨Çexion/extension using a speciÔ¨Åcally designed ergometer. They were measured randomly at different joint posi- tions according to the recommendations by Gallagher et al. (1998) (see also ChafÔ¨Ån et al., 2006). The following joint positions were imposed with help of a goniometer and deÔ¨Åned from a reference standing posture (Fig. 1a): Ô¨Çexion of 0 for the ankle, Ô¨Çexion of 45 for the knee and Ô¨Çexion of 60 for the hip. Table 1 summarizes the main characteristics of each group.  2.2.  Experimental set-up and test conÔ¨Ågurations  A multi-adjustable experimental mock-up, similar to that used in our past study (Wang et al., 2000), was used to simulate different pedal conÔ¨Ågurations. It was composed of a seat, footrest, steering wheel, accelerator pedal and clutch pedal. The adjustments in height of the seat and steering wheel were motorized as well as the clutch pedal adjustment both in depth and in height with respect to

The other adjustments such as pedal travel length, pedal travel inclination and the clutch pedal lateral position were done manually by an experimenter. The range of lateral ad- justments of the pedal was 60 mm with an increment of 10 mm. The pedal resistance was conÔ¨Ågured manually by the experimenter using the same spring for all tested conÔ¨Ågurations. The pedal resistance at the end of depression was not explicitly controlled as in our earlier study (Wang et al., 2000). It was dependent on the pre-loading applied to the spring when adjusting the pedal surface orientation with respect to the horizontal plane (clutch pedal initial angle, Fig. 2). The acceleration pedal was attached to the support of the clutch pedal. For a given clutch pedal conÔ¨Åguration, the accel- eration pedal moved together with the clutch pedal when adjusting its position horizontally and vertically. The steering wheel location was let to each participant‚Äôs preference. Six pedal conÔ¨Ågurations (Table 2) were chosen among eleven, provided by the three car manufacturers participating in the research project, in order to cover the large range of pedal design parameters from currently existing vehicles. The conÔ¨Ågurations C1 to C4 and C6 were selected as border conÔ¨Ågurations of the  Fig. 2.

For each imposed pedal conÔ¨Åguration, a less-constrained condition, for which the subjects could adjust the pedal position, was also tested. In order to estimate the repeatability of the movement and discomfort rating, the central conÔ¨Åguration C5 was tested three times. The trial order was randomized. The body movements were captured at 100 Hz with 10 MX40 cameras of the VICON optoelectronic system (Oxford, UK) using 40 surface markers attached to the whole body. Pedal force was measured at 1000 Hz using a three-axe force sensor DAC-2000-P speciÔ¨Åcally designed by TME (Toulon, France) for automotive clutch and braking pedals (ranged from 200 to 1500 N). Six reÔ¨Çective markers were attached on the pedal for measuring its displacement. A speciÔ¨Åc mock-up coordinate system, centered at the reference H-point of the seat, was used to deÔ¨Åne the pedal conÔ¨Ågurations (Fig. 2). Its origin corresponded to the barycentre of the seat H- point travel path. The seat reference H-point was measured prior to the experiment with the help of the SAE H-point machine (SAE J826) using a FARO arm digitizer (www.faro.com). As a same seat was used for all test conÔ¨Ågurations, the mock-up coordinate system center at the seat H-point was therefore the same.  2.3. Questionnaire and global discomfort evaluation  Discomfort feelings when clutching the pedal were collected for all trials by means of a questionnaire, which was composed of two parts. First, multiple-choice questions were designed to assess possible interference with the seat, the appropriateness of the four pedal design parameters (pedal position at beginning and end depression, travel length, travel angle) and the perception of the clutch pedal force. The global discomfort was then rated using a modiÔ¨Åed CP-50 category partition scale (Chevalot and Wang, 2004, see also Shen and Parsons, 1997 for a comparative study on rating scales). The scale was put in front of the subject and was visible all the time. They were instructed to Ô¨Årst select a category among seven responses (imperceptible, very low, low, medium, high, very high, extremely high), then to reÔ¨Åne their judgement by choosing a number from 1 to 10 within the selected category. The real scale from 0 to 50 and more (original CP-50) was hidden from the subject in order to give priority to the category choice and not to a nu- merical value. Due to the limited length of this paper, only results regarding the start and end pedal positions and global discomfort ratings will be presented.

Experimental procedure  The experiment began with the measurement of the main subject anthropometric dimensions. Anatomical landmarks were palpated on the pelvis and left lower limb according to the proce- dure described by van Sint Jan (2007). Then, reÔ¨Çective markers were put on these same points after manual palpation. Prior to the clutch pedal experiment, the data for characterizing the subject‚Äôs individual physical capacity of the left lower limb were collected. For the hip Ô¨Çexion extension ROM, participants were asked to slowly Ô¨Çex the left hip until to the maximum, then to slowly extend the hip to the maximum from a standing position. They were standing upright on the right leg. In order to help maintain balance during the movement, they were asked to grasp a horizontal bar placed in front of them. For the knee and ankle Ô¨Çexioneextension ROMs, participants were seated on a stool to move slowly the knee and ankle to their limits. For each joint ROM, subjects were asked to repeat the motion three times. For each joint torque, they were asked to exert a maximum voluntary joint torque and to maintain it during 5 s. Each joint‚Äôs maximum torque was measured twice with a rest of at least 40 s between two repetitions. Subjects were then asked to sit down in the seat of the experi- mental mock-up and to familiarize themselves with the available adjustments and the discomfort questionnaire. For this, three conÔ¨Ågurations were tested at Ô¨Årst for training purposes. They consisted of two extreme conÔ¨Ågurations, which were a priori very uncomfortable and one average conÔ¨Åguration considered to be less uncomfortable. The two extreme conÔ¨Ågurations were: one combining a high seat height, a small travel inclination angle and a long travel length; and the other combining a low seat height, a high travel inclination angle and a long travel length. For each imposed pedal conÔ¨Åguration, participants were asked Ô¨Årst to adjust the horizontal seat position with respect to the accelerator pedal before adjusting the steering wheel. After testing an imposed pedal conÔ¨Åguration, an experimenter changed the pedal position by placing it out of reach of the left foot. Then subjects were asked to choose their preferred pedal position while keeping all other pa- rameters unchanged. The adjustments in longitudinal (x-axis) and vertical (z-axis) directions were carried out by subjects themselves using a remote controller. For lateral direction (y-axis), the adjustment was performed with the help of an experimenter. This adjustment process continued until the preferred clutch pedal position was found. During the pedal position adjustment process, the subjects could perform as many pedal depressions as necessary. For all trials, before recording the clutching movement, subjects were asked to Ô¨Åll in the discomfort questionnaire. Usually, several tests were required in order to answer the questionnaire. Then, a complete pedal clutching movement was recorded. Participants were instructed to start motion with a standard driving posture (the left foot on the foot rest, the right foot on the acceleration pedal and the hands on the steering wheel), to push the clutch pedal with  the left foot without changing the positions of the right foot and hands, then to maintain the clutch pedal fully pressed for about 3 s, Ô¨Ånally releasing the pedal and replacing the left foot on the foot rest. The whole duration of the experiment lasted about four and a half hours. A pause of at least 10 min was imposed in the middle of the experiment during which drinks and biscuits were provided. The subjects were allowed to take a break whenever requested during the experimentation.  2.5. Data processing  2.5.1. Motion reconstruction  The whole body motions were reconstructed by an inverse ki- nematic method which calculates the joint angles from captured trajectories of skin markers by minimizing the distance between the captured and model-based markers positions (see Ausejo and Wang, 2009 for the principle of motion reconstruction). In this paper, we focus only on the left lower limb. The lower limb kine- matic model has seven degrees of freedom (Fig. 1). Joint forces and torques were then computed using a 3D inverse dynamics method based on homogeneous matrices (Doriot and Ch√®ze, 2004). Inertial properties of the body segments were calculated from subjects‚Äô anthropometric dimensions using the regression equations of Dumas et al. (2007). The joint forces and torques were computed iteratively at each frame by isolating the body segments from the most distal to the most proximal. Then, joint moments were projected onto the kinematic axes of their respective joint.  2.5.2. Motion analysis  The two main key instants were identiÔ¨Åed from a clutching movement: the beginning of pedal depression, i.e. when the left foot starts depressing the clutch pedal, and the end of pedal depression, i.e. when pedal end travel is reached. The beginning of pedal depression was deÔ¨Åned as the Ô¨Årst frame when the force recorded by the pedal force sensor was above 5% of the maximal force recorded in the trial. The end of pedal depression was deÔ¨Åned as the Ô¨Årst frame when the left foot velocity, calculated from nu- merical derivation and Ô¨Åltering (low-pass 4th order Butterworth with a cut-off frequency at 10 Hz) of the recorded trajectories of a marker located on the top of the foot near the toes, was below 5% of the maximum velocity recorded after the beginning of pedal depression in the trial. These speciÔ¨Åc instants or key-frames were determined for each recorded motion. Postures were analyzed at these two key-frames. For the foot force applied to the pedal and the joint torques of the left lower limb, the analysis was performed only at the end of depression. The main parameters analysed in the paper are deÔ¨Åned in Fig. 3.

Data analysis  An ANOVA for multiple factors was mainly used to analyse the effects of group of participants, test conÔ¨Åguration and type of conÔ¨Åguration on biomechanical parameters (joint angles and tor- ques) as well as discomfort rating. As participants tested both imposed (IM) and less-constrained (LC) conditions for all test conÔ¨Ågurations, a paired sample t-test was performed to test null hypothesis (no signiÔ¨Åcant different between IM and LC). The dif- ferences between IM and LC were calculated for each test conÔ¨Åg- uration performed by a same participant. For the pedal position adjustments, only effects of group of participants and test conÔ¨Åg- uration were analysed. For the categorical responses to the multiple choice questions from the questionnaire were compared between imposed and less-constrained conditions. Their independence was tested by a Chi squared test. Statistical signiÔ¨Åcance level was Ô¨Åxed at p ¬º 0.05.  3. Results  3.1. Adjustment of pedal position  The variations in the clutch pedal position between imposed and less-constrained conÔ¨Ågurations were estimated using the reÔ¨Çective markers Ô¨Åxed on the clutch pedal. Table 3 gives the means and standard deviations of the pedal adjustments in x, y and z by participant group and test conÔ¨Åguration. The displacements in x, y and z directions from imposed pedal positions to preferred ones were  8.8,  21 and  16.8 mm on average respectively. A strong effect of pedal conÔ¨Åguration was observed. Indeed, initially high clutch pedals were lowered for C1, C2 and, C3. For those close to the seat (C5, C6), the pedal was placed farther away from the seat. A more leftward pedal position was also preferred for all conÔ¨Ågura- tions. A signiÔ¨Åcant effect of the subject group was observed in x and z directions only. The preferred positions were also analysed with respect to subject‚Äôs stature by simple regression. Apart from lateral position (p ¬º 0.265), both longitudinal (DX) and vertical (DZ) adjustments were signiÔ¨Åcantly dependent on stature and taller persons preferred a farther and higher position:  DX ¬º 112e0.0715*Stature (in mm), R2 ¬º 5.5%, p ¬º 0.0029 DZ ¬º  222 √æ 0.0124*Stature (in mm), R2 ¬º 6%, p ¬º 0.0018.  3.2.

For each question, subjects were asked to choose one of three proposed answers: too high/good/too low for pedal height, too far/good/too near for pedal longitudinal distance, too left/good/ too right for pedal lateral position. Table 4 shows the frequency of each of these three answers. Strong effects of the type of conÔ¨Ågu- ration (imposed/preferred) were found a using a Chi-square test (Table 4). At the start depression, imposed pedal conÔ¨Ågurations were found too high for 55% of the responses, too near for 40% and too rightward for 64%, whereas more than 90% of trials with a response of ‚Äúgood‚Äù were obtained for less-constrained conÔ¨Ågura- tions for all three directions. However, the free pedal adjustment did not seem to improve the comfort perception of the end depression position as much as for the pedal‚Äôs start position. Instead, at the end depression, the free pedal adjustment increased the perception of ‚Äútoo low‚Äù and ‚Äútoo far‚Äù respectively from 16% to 22% and from 32% to 42%. Therefore the subjects tended to improve the beginning of the clutch pedal operation at the expense of the end.  3.2.2.

R. Pannetier, X. Wang / Applied Ergonomics 45 (2014) 1010e1018  1015  evaluate the repeatability of discomfort ratings. The maximum gap in discomfort rating between three repeated trials and their mean was calculated. 13 out of 20 subjects had a mean maximum gap higher than 5, implying that the rating of an identical target may change the category from trial to trial. In particular, three subjects had an average value higher than 10, probably suggesting difÔ¨Åculty in using the rating scale. In this experiment, the mean maximum gap value was 6.8. An ANOVA was performed for analysing the effects of the three variables (Group of subjects, ConÔ¨Åguration and Type of conÔ¨Ågura- tion) on the CP50 discomfort ratings. A paired sample t-test was also performed on the differences between less-constrained (LC) and imposed (IM) conÔ¨Ågurations. Results are summarized in Table 5 and show that discomfort rating strongly depended on these three factors. Lowest discomfort score of 13.6 was obtained for C3 and highest score for C6. There was a signiÔ¨Åcant effect of subject group on discomfort scores, the average differences be- tween the four groups varied from 2.3 to 6.1, smaller than the mean maximum gap value, i.e. 6.8. As expected, the less-constrained conÔ¨Ågurations were better rated than the imposed ones (Table 5).  3.3.  Biomechanical analysis  3.3.1.  Joint angles  The Ô¨Çexioneextension angles and torques of the hip, knee and ankle joints were examined at the beginning and the end of the clutching movement (Table 6). SigniÔ¨Åcant differences in Ô¨Çexione extension angles at hip, knee and ankle were found between imposed and less-constrained conÔ¨Ågurations by paired sample t- tests. These differences were in agreement with the adjustments for preferred clutch pedal positions. The highest variation in the ankle joint Ô¨Çexioneextension angle was found at the beginning of depression. Globally, the change of pedal position led to a decrease in the Ô¨Çexion of the hip, knee and ankle joints at the beginning, and an increase of the extension of these joints at the end of the pedal depression, especially for the ankle. SigniÔ¨Åcant effects of the group of subjects and test conÔ¨Åguration were also found on the joint angles (Table 6).  3.3.2.  Pedal  force and joint torques  The force applied on the pedal and the joint torques were ana- lysed only at the end of pedal depression (see Fig. 3 for deÔ¨Ånition of  Table 5 Mean values and standard deviation of the raw and centred CP50 scores ac- cording to the group of subjects (G), the test conÔ¨Åguration (C) and the type of conÔ¨Åguration (T).

The foot force applied on the pedal was decomposed in three components with respect to the pedal travel path: tangential, normal and lateral forces. As the contact forces between the thigh and the seat were not estimated, the hip joint torque was not considered. An ANOVA was performed on knee and ankle joint torques, three pedal force components and pedal force direction in XZ plane with respect to the hip-foot pedal contact point. The means and standard deviations of these 6 variables are summarized in Table 7. A strong effect of test conÔ¨Åguration and group of subjects was found for the six variables. SigniÔ¨Åcant effect of conÔ¨Åguration type (freely/imposed) was only found on the lateral force component by ANOVA. By paired sample t-tests, a signiÔ¨Åcant difference in ankle joint torque was also found. As less-constrained and imposed conÔ¨Ågurations only differed in pedal position, the tangential force required for fully depressing the pedal should be remained un- changed. The lateral force components were mainly directed left- wards from the driver‚Äôs point-of-view. A small increase in the lateral force towards the left direction was observed for all pedals when comparing the less-constrained conÔ¨Ågurations with imposed ones. Concerning the effect of subject group, a higher tangential force was observed for older subjects than for younger ones. Lower normal force was observed for older volunteers than younger ones, in agreement with the pedal force direction with respect to hip- pedal contact point in the xz plane (parallel to the body sagittal plane). The deviations of pedal force direction from the hip-pedal line were on average 0.8,  2.7,  6.1 and  11.4 degrees contact respectively for older females, older males, younger females and younger males. Pedal force was therefore directed more closely to the hip for older subjects than for younger ones, leading to a lower knee torque for younger volunteers.  4. Discussions  In this study, clutch pedal position as well as joint angles, pedal force and joint torques of the left lower limb were compared be- tween six imposed conÔ¨Ågurations and corresponding less con- strained ones with freely adjusted pedal position. Due to small variation in discomfort rating among trials and relatively low reproducibility in discomfort rating, it is therefore difÔ¨Åcult to Ô¨Ånd any objective variables to explain the variance of discomfort rat- ings. In what follows, we‚Äôll mainly focus the discussions on the differences in objective parameters between imposed and less- constrained conÔ¨Ågurations for a better understanding of clutch pedal position adjustment. The analysis of the clutch pedal adjustments showed that the subjects moved the pedal further away from the seat and also lowered it for the less-constrained conÔ¨Ågurations. This led to a decrease in the Ô¨Çexion of the hip, knee and ankle joints at the beginning and an increase of the extension of these joints at the end of the pedal depression as the travel length was kept un- changed. The difference in the joint Ô¨Çexion extension angle be- tween freely adjusted and imposed conÔ¨Ågurations was the highest for the ankle. Compared to the joint ROM values collected, the ankle angle was very close to its dorsiÔ¨Çexion limit at the beginning of pedal depression (Table 1) for the imposed conÔ¨Ågurations. The subjects may have adjusted the pedal position so as to reduce the ankle dorsiÔ¨Çexion angle away from its limit when depressing the pedal in agreement with the cost functions suggested by Cruse et al (1990) and also by Kee (2002). This may at least partly explain the decrease in discomfort rating for preferred pedal conÔ¨Ågurations. It was also observed that a clutch pedal positioned more to the driver‚Äôs left was preferred by participants when comparing imposed and freely adjusted conÔ¨Ågurations. The lateral clutch po- sition varied from  60 mm for C1 to  120 mm for C3. The range of  
the lateral adjustment was  41 mm for C1 to 0.9 mm for C3 on about  110 mm was average. An average lateral position of preferred, slightly smaller than the half of the distance between two pelvis illac crests (135 mm on average from the participants of this study). One explanation could be that people prefer to mini- mise the distance from foot rest position to the pedal at the beginning of the depression, according to the hypothesis of mini- mum work suggested by Wang et al. (2004). In the present experiment, only the pedal position changed between imposed and preferred pedal conÔ¨Ågurations. Other pedal characteristics such as its resistance, travel length and travel inclination were kept unchanged. Relative position between clutch and acceleration pedals was also kept unchanged as they both moved together when adjusting the clutch pedal position. Pedal force direction was close to the hip-pedal line with an average of  5.6 degrees deviation angle (Table 7). This deviation was signiÔ¨Åcantly dependent on pedal conÔ¨Åguration and also on subject group. Older subjects preferred a pedal force more directed to the hip than younger ones. But no signiÔ¨Åcant difference in pedal force direction in XZ plane and knee joint torque was found between imposed and preferred conÔ¨Ågurations, suggesting that pedal posi- tion adjustment was not motivated by reducing joint torque under the experimental conditions of the present study. From our previ- ous study (Wang et al., 2004), it was shown that discomfort rating was strongly dependent on pedal resistance and that discomfort was also signiÔ¨Åcantly correlated to joint torques at the end of pedal depression, especially to the knee joint torque. Interestingly, a weak but signiÔ¨Åcantly correlation between CP50 raw scores and knee and ankle joint torque at the end of depression. Fig. 4 shows the discomfort ratings in terms of knee torques for all test conÔ¨Ågurations. In summary, pedal position adjustment is an iterative trial-error process in which a subject generally carries out a large number of trials before Ô¨Ånding a preferred pedal position. The results of the present study are in agreement with our earlier suggestion (Wang et al., 2000) that pedal position may result from the principle of minimum work and minimum discomfort. The pedal was posi- tioned neither too high, thus avoiding unnecessary work raising the leg, nor too low, which helped to avoid an uncomfortably large ankle extension at the end of pedal travel. It was also adjusted to be neither too near, thus reducing ankle dorsiÔ¨Çexion, nor too far, avoiding too large a joint extension at the end of travel. Interest- ingly, the results of the present study seem to show that the comfort at the beginning of depression was more privileged than the comfort at the end of travel. Results also show that pedal po- sition adjustment was not motivated by a more efÔ¨Åcient foot force exertion for reducing joint efforts. As explained in , one of the motivations of the present work was to explore the possibility of deÔ¨Åning design criteria based on objective parameters for helping design engineers using a digital human model (DHM). Results of the present study show that assessing a control design like clutch pedal is challenging using a DHM. Firstly, deÔ¨Åning objective assessment criteria is difÔ¨Åcult. Though six pedal conÔ¨Ågurations were selected covering a large range of existing clutch pedal designs, their range of variation is not large enough for a large variation in discomfort perception. It is therefore difÔ¨Åcult to establish direct relationship between discomfort and any objective measures only using the data of the present study. However, the results of the present study suggest that pedal assessment criteria should consider joint angles in particular the ankle at the start of depression and joint torques at the end of pedal depression.

But their use should be combined with other considerations than biomechanical factors. Secondly, engineers often have to assess different alternative de- signs with small differences between them. When comparing the movements between imposed and less-constrained pedal conÔ¨Åg- urations, consistent joint angles with respect to pedal position change were obtained. But their differences were very small. For example, the average differences in hip, knee and ankle Ô¨Çexione extension angles between imposed and less-constrained conÔ¨Ågu- rations were respectively about 1.4, 1.1 and 4.1 degrees at the start of depression, and 2.8, 2 and 3.9 degrees at the end (Table 6). Considering the kinematic redundancy of the body with respect to the task, a person can adopt more than one posture for a same pedal position. As only the tangential component of foot force is imposed by pedal resistance, two other components are not totally Ô¨Åxed, thus allowing a person to adopt different foot force control strategies. Thus, different joint torques can be obtained for a same body posture depending on foot force direction. For example, older participants seemed to adopt a foot force control reducing hip torque, whereas younger persons preferred more reducing knee joint torque. Therefore, kinematic and dynamic motion simulations should be experimentally validated before using any assessment criterion based on motion-related parameters. In summary, digital human model is a useful tool for analysing task-related motions and understanding possible causes of discomfort. But, its use as a  prediction tool for optimising a product design requires experi- mentally validated simulation algorithms. There are several limitations of the present study that we would like to point out. Firstly, though six pedal conÔ¨Ågurations were selected covering a large range of existing clutch pedal designs, only their location were studied in the present study. Other factors like pedal resistance and their interactions with pedal location were not investigated. Secondly clutch pedal design may be critical in case of the long repetition of clutching movements, in a trafÔ¨Åc jam or during an urban journey. Under the current experimental conditions, subjects were asked to assess a pedal conÔ¨Åguration without any real task associated. Only the discomfort related to the clutching movement was investigated, not the task associated with the movement. More realistic experimental conditions should be encouraged in future. Finally, it should be noted that the experi- ment tests lasted about 4.5 h. There might be an effect of fatigue on movement and discomfort perception. Thanks to the random- isation of trial order, fatigue effect should be avoided.  5.  Conclusions  By comparing six existing pedal conÔ¨Ågurations and corre- sponding freely adjusted ones, results showed that pedal position was adjusted in all three directions to ensure a good starting pedal position, which allowed a less Ô¨Çexed ankle. Pedal position adjust- ment seemed not motivated by reducing joint torque though discomfort ratings were found signiÔ¨Åcantly correlated with knee and ankle torques at the end of depression. In addition to the results for further improvement of clutch pedal location, the present work also illustrates that the less-constrained motion concept is helpful for a better understanding of people preference and useful for identifying motion-related biomechanical parameters to be considered for deÔ¨Åning assessment criteria.

s0003687014000027,"  Fire Ô¨Åghting is a physically demanding profession even though the number of interventions and occupational demand during a 24- hour shift might be low. At an emergency scene, Ô¨Åre Ô¨Åghters perform a series of actions under stressful conditions, such as moving and lifting heavy weights and rescuing victims while wearing protective clothing and a self-contained breathing appa- ratus (SCBA). The total weight of the equipment and SCBA is around 21e22 kg. As such, it increases the energy demand signiÔ¨Åcantly (Baker et al., 2000; Dreger et al., 2006; Selkirk and Mc Lellan, 2004). Bos et al. (2004) conducted a Ô¨Åeld study during eighty-Ô¨Åve 24 h shifts in Dutch Ô¨Åre stations and they concluded that two tasks (SCBA and Inside tasks) in actual Ô¨Åre Ô¨Åghting exceed the guideline for energetic workload of Wu and Wang (Wu and Wang, 2001, 2002). This guideline consists of prediction models on the rela- tionship between the percentage of heart rate reserve (%HRR) and the acceptable work duration (MAWD) for both short and long periods of work. The real duration of the ‚ÄúInside and SCBA‚Äù tasks were 23 and 21 min; the corresponding MAWDs are 17 and 4 min respectively. In addition, Ô¨Åre Ô¨Åghters are exposed to high  * Corresponding author. Tel.: √æ32 16390411; fax: √æ32 16400236. lieve.vandersmissen@idewe.be (G.J.M. Vandersmissen).

Heart rates measured during normal Ô¨Åre Ô¨Åghting tasks are at or near maximal levels (Bos et al., 2004). Elsner and Kolkhorst (2008) found the oxygen uptake associated with performing live Ô¨Åre rescue and suppression tasks were around 62% of the VO2max. According to an investigation of Bilzon et al. (2001) metabolic demands of simulated shipboard Ô¨Åre Ô¨Åghting tasks could reach up to peaks of 43 ml oxygen/kg/min, being equivalent to 82% of Consequently, it is imperative that Ô¨Åre Ô¨Åghters are physically Ô¨Åt to perform their job and to guarantee their own safety as well as the safety of their colleagues and victims. Numerous studies have demonstrated the necessity of maintain- ing a high level of aerobic capacity for rescue personnel such as Ô¨Åre Ô¨Åghters (Bilzon et al., 2001; Bos et al., 2004; Elsner and Kolkhorst, 2008). Leading researchers and agencies recommend that the mea- surement of aerobic capacity would be included in the medical examination of Ô¨Åre Ô¨Åghters. The measurement of aerobic capacity is recommended to be part of the medical examination of Ô¨Åre Ô¨Åghters by leading researchers and agencies (Ben-Ezra and Verstraete, 1988; Elsner and Kolkhorst, 2008; International Association of Fire Fighters, 2008; Peate et al., 2002).

Vandersmissen et al.  / Applied Ergonomics 45 (2014) 1063e1066  VO2max,  have led to minimal requirements for ranging from 33.5 ml/kg/min (Sothmann et al., 1990) to 41 (Bilzon et al., 2001) and 45 (Gledhill and Jamnik, 1992) ml/kg/min. In Belgium, for example, Ô¨Åre Ô¨Åghters wearing SCBA should have a minimum VO2max of 45 ml/kg.min (Kiss et al., 2010). Aerobic capacity can be measured at either sub maximal or maximal level. Sub maximal aerobic capacity tests, when properly validated, provide an accurate estimation of an individual‚Äôs oxygen consumption. These tests are less expensive and easier to carry out than maximal tests since they can be performed in a Ô¨Åtness centre by qualiÔ¨Åed trainers or coaches. Maximal aerobic capacity tests on the other hand, can only be carried out by qualiÔ¨Åed medical personnel under the supervision of a physician. Testing must be conducted in a medical setting with electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring, resuscitation and deÔ¨Åbrillation equipment on site (International association of Fire Fighters, 2008). However, maximal testing is often preferred because the results are more precise and consistent than sub maximal testing (Dreger et al., 2006; Elsner and Kolkhorst, 2008; Kiss et al., 2010). A variety of exercise tests can be used in order to determine VO2 max. Several studies emphasize the use of task speciÔ¨Åc exercise tests because of particular adaptations in the organism to that activity (Ben-Ezra and Verstraete, 1988; Wisl√∏ff and Helgerud, 1998). For Ô¨Åre Ô¨Åghters a tread mill or stair mill exercise test is recommended (Ben-Ezra and Verstraete, 1988; International Association of Fire Fighters, 2008). This type of exercise resembles most of the emer- gency activities of Ô¨Åre Ô¨Åghters. In the case of a maximal test, sub- jects should complete a continuous, incremental stair mill or tread mill run to exhaustion with continuous monitoring of ECG and oxygen consumption (VO2max). However, in daily practice many aerobic capacity tests are per- formed by cardiologists who prefer bicycle ergo meter tests because the electrocardiogram during these tests is more stable and hence shows better ischemic changes than an electrocardio- gram during a tread mill test. Treadmill tests are more performed at Sports Medicine centres. Maximal oxygen consumption depends on age, gender, physical activity, heart rate at maximal exercise, and weight (Fleg et al., 2005; Hawkins and Wiswell, 2003; Kiss et al., 2010; Laukkanen et al., 2009). Furthermore, non-personal factors like the type of test and test centre might inÔ¨Çuence an individuals‚Äô VO2max (Ben- Ezra and Verstraete, 1988; Wisl√∏ff and Helgerud, 1998). As the decision to declare a Ô¨Åre Ô¨Åghter Ô¨Åt for his job depends largely on the result of the VO2max, it is important to investigate the relation be- tween VO2 max, the type of test and the possible inÔ¨Çuence of the test centre on the outcome. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the current daily practice of aerobic capacity testing in Belgian Ô¨Åre Ô¨Åghters using data gathered from different Ô¨Åeld practitioners in different test centres. It was hypothesized that persons who performed a treadmill test reached a higher VO2 max than those who performed a bicycle test. During running more muscle groups are involved than during cycling, therefore it can be expected that VO2 max is higher in tread mill running than in ergometer cycling (Wasserman and Hanssen, 2005). The second hypothesis was that the maximal oxygen up- take varied among the test centres. Test centres use different testing protocols and although it is asked to perform maximal ex- ercise test, centres can differ in the evaluation of maximal exhaustion.  2.  Study population and methods  Maximal oxygen uptake (VO2 max) is used for the evaluation of cardio respiratory Ô¨Åtness in Belgian Ô¨Åre Ô¨Åghters. Once a year, Ô¨Åre  Ô¨Åghters have a medical examination by their occupational physi- cian. Every Ô¨Åve years, the occupational physician refers the Ô¨Åre Ô¨Åghters to a cardiologic or Sports Medicine centre for VO2 max determination. According to the Belgian guidelines for the medical evaluation of Ô¨Åre Ô¨Åghters, VO2 max needs to be measured directly, preferably during a maximal stair mill test, if not available during a maximal treadmill test or bicycle ergo meter test. Since 1999, Ô¨Åve occupational physicians of IDEWE, the largest external service for prevention and protection at work in Belgium, gathered 613 VO2 max results of 605 male and 8 female Ô¨Åre Ô¨Åghters. The tests were performed at 22 different cardiologic or Sports Medicine centres. Besides VO2 max, age, gender, body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, type of test (treadmill or bicycle) and medical centre, data on the quality of the performance of the tests such as heart rate at maximal exercise were registered. Maximal oxygen uptake was directly measured during a maximal cardio respiratory exercise test on a treadmill or bicycle ergo meter. As Ô¨Åre Ô¨Åghters were referred to different cardiologic or Sports Medicine centres, different test protocols and measuring equipment were used. The comparison of the heart rate at maximal exercise to the expected maximum heart rate for age (220 beats per minute (bpm) e age) was used as a measure of the quality of the performance of the test (Maximum heart rate percentage ¬º Percentage of maximum heart rate for age at maximal exercise ¬º heart rate at maximal exer- cise*100/expected maximal heart rate for age). Since there were only 8 women in the total population, the analysis was conÔ¨Åned to the results of 605 male Ô¨Åre Ô¨Åghters who underwent cardio respiratory testing in 22 different cardiologic or Sports Medicine centres in Flanders (the Dutch speaking part of Belgium) from 1999 until 2010. All statistical analyses were conducted with SPSS 19.0 for Mc Intosh. Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) was used to test for statisti- cally signiÔ¨Åcant differences in continuous variables, chi-square for dichotomous variables. A univariate general linear model was used to detect the determinants and possible interactions that best predicted maximal oxygen uptake. For this model the database was limited to the 6 cardiologic centres that delivered a minimum of 10 cardio respiratory tests, reducing the study population to 564 cases. All important factors and covariates and all their possible in- teractions were put in the initial model, leaving out one by one the least signiÔ¨Åcant to obtain a model that best predicted the depen- dent variable.  3. Results  (n ¬º 603, Mean age of the study population was 40.4 years SD ¬º 11.5), ranging between 20 and 60 years. Almost 60 percent was under 45 years of age. Mean VO2 max was 43.3 ml/kg.min (n ¬º 605, SD ¬º 9.8). Mean VO2 max according to age, BMI, waist circumference, type of exercise test and maximum heart rate for age (220 bpm e age) attained or not attained according to age is shown in Table 1. Maximal oxygen uptake was statistically signiÔ¨Å- cantly dependent of all these variables. Of the 605 tests performed, 71.1% were treadmill tests, and 28.6% were bicycle tests (for two persons the type of test was un- known). Mean maximal oxygen uptake, age, BMI, waist circum- ference, and percentage of the maximum heart rate for age at maximal exercise for treadmill and bicycle tests are shown in Table 2. Mean maximal oxygen uptake was statistically signiÔ¨Åcantly different between treadmill and bicycle tests (45.8 ml/kg.min versus 37.3 ml/kg.min). Also age, waist circumference and the mean maximum heart rate percentage were statistically signiÔ¨Åcantly different between treadmill and bicycle tests. Fire Ô¨Åghters who underwent bicycle testing had a lower VO2 max, but they were also

Of those who performed a treadmill test 64.4% reached the maximum heart rate according to age, comparing to 25.0% of those who performed a bicycle test. This difference is statistically signiÔ¨Åcant (chi square, p < 0.001). Maximal oxygen uptake was related to the type of test per- formed and the centre where the test had been performed. In Table 3, the mean VO2 max of the 6 centres that delivered a mini- mum of 10 tests is compared. A statistically signiÔ¨Åcant difference in mean VO2max between centres was found even if treadmill and bicycle tests were compared separately. For the two centres that offered both types of test, VO2max was signiÔ¨Åcantly higher if per- formed on a treadmill than on a bicycle. The results of a univariate general linear model analysis to detect the determinants and their interactions that best predict maximal oxygen uptake are shown in Table 4. Waist circumference was chosen as a measure of overweight over BMI because the relation between waist circumference and VO2 max was stronger in a univariate regression model than the relationship between BMI and VO2 max. Determinants listed in Table 4 explained together 62% of the variation of VO2 max.

There was a signif- icant interaction between age and the type of test indicating that the effect of age on the maximal oxygen uptake was dependent of the type of test. Other signiÔ¨Åcant determinants were the perfor- mance of the test as expressed by the maximum heart rate per- centage and the centre where the test had been performed.  4. Discussion and conclusion  VO2max  The aim of this study was to evaluate the current daily practice of aerobic capacity testing in Belgian Ô¨Åre Ô¨Åghters. The hypothesis that persons who performed a treadmill test reached a higher than those who performed a bicycle test and that the maximal oxygen uptake varied signiÔ¨Åcantly among test centres, was conÔ¨Årmed. The relationships between these not person related determinants and VO2max remained signiÔ¨Åcant even after correc- tion for age and waist circumference, two important determinants of aerobic capacity. Bicycle tests aren‚Äôt commonly used in scientiÔ¨Åc investigations concerning aerobic capacity testing of Ô¨Åre Ô¨Åghters, in fact all in- vestigations concerning this subject in recent literature used tread mill, step or stair mill tests, because these exercises, in contrast to cycling, resemble more the activities Ô¨Åre Ô¨Åghters do in emergency situations (Ben-Ezra and Verstraete, 1988; Bilzon et al., 2001; Bruce-low et al., 2007; Dreger et al., 2006; International Associa- tion of Fire Fighters, 2008; Kiss et al., 2010; Peate et al., 2002; Selkirk and Mc Lellan, 2004). In this study the data gathered during daily aerobic capacity testing in a sample of Belgian Ô¨Åre Ô¨Åghters were analysed in order to evaluate current practice in Belgium. In this sample 28.6% of aerobic capacity testing was performed on a bicycle ergometer. Using data of current practice made it possible to gather VO2max results from a large population of Ô¨Åre Ô¨Åghters, much larger  Table 2 Mean age, BMI, waist circumference, VO2 max and maximum heart rate percentage for treadmill and bicycle tests.

This is a major strength of this study. However the multi- plicity of centres where tests were performed, implicated that it was not possible to gather information on the testing protocols used. Analysing existing data also holds the limitation that social factor like motivation could differ and inÔ¨Çuence the results. This might be another weakness of this study. However we are conÔ¨Å- dent that the Ô¨Åre Ô¨Åghters who underwent aerobic capacity testing in this study were motivated to deliver a maximum effort as the decision to be declared Ô¨Åt for their job depended on an adequate VO2max result. The mean VO2 max (45.8 ml/kg.min) of Ô¨Åre Ô¨Åghters performing treadmill tests in our study was in close agreement with the values for Ô¨Åre Ô¨Åghters tested on treadmills in other studies (Barr et al., 2010; Ben-Ezra and Verstraete, 1988; Elsner and Kolkhorst, 2008; Kiss et al., 2010). Waist circumference and age were signiÔ¨Åcant predictors of maximal oxygen uptake. This relationship between parameters of obesity and age and maximal oxygen uptake have been demon- strated in several investigations (Fleg et al., 2005; Hawkins and Wiswell, 2003; Kiss et al., 2010; Laukkanen et al., 2009). Maximum heart rate for age was more often reached in tread mill than in bicycle tests, suggesting workload was increased to a higher level in tread mill tests. Ben-Ezra and Verstraete (1988) found a signiÔ¨Åcant difference in VO2max between tread mill and stair climbing exercise. They suggest that the type of exercise test (and training) should be task-speciÔ¨Åc and that a stair mill test is preferable to a treadmill test. A bicycle test differs considerably from the physiological requirements of Ô¨Åre Ô¨Åghting and is therefore probably inferior to the cardio respiratory evaluation of Ô¨Åre Ô¨Åghters. Likewise, sport-speciÔ¨Åc tests are important in sports medicine (Wisl√∏ff and Helgerud, 1998). On the other hand cardiologists often prefer to do a bicycle test because the ECG during a bicycle exercise test is of better quality and ischemic changes can be detected more adequately. Therefore it should be preferable to disconnect the cardiologic evaluation with exercise testing to detect ischemic changes on ECG from the aerobic capacity testing that should be task-speciÔ¨Åc. Fire Ô¨Åghters with cardiovascular risk factors should have a cardiologic check-up prior to the aerobic capacity testing. This study also conÔ¨Årms that the mean VO2max is higher in some centres independently of the type of test. This might be due to the use of different testing protocols. Some centres probably insist more to proceed to maximal exhaustion than others. This Ô¨Ånding underlines the need for a stringent testing protocol. The Interna- tional Association of Fire Fighters (IAFF) (2008) has formulated a  protocol that could be an example for institutions and agencies that elaborate ability tests and criteria for Ô¨Åre Ô¨Åghters. The decision to declare a Ô¨Åre Ô¨Åghter able to perform Ô¨Åre Ô¨Åghting tasks depends among other variables on his aerobic capacity. We therefore recommend that the exercise test should be speciÔ¨Åed and task-speciÔ¨Åc. A stringent testing protocol should be developed in order to gather results that are interpretable, comparable and useful for further investigations.

s0003687014000039,"  In France, nearly 200,000 disabled persons use a manual wheelchair (MWC) and live at home (Vignier et al., 2008). Travel- ling difÔ¨Åculties are one of the determining factors in non- integration or occupational exclusion of persons in MWC (Lidal et al., 2007; Van Velzen et al., 2009). Environmental unsuitability ampliÔ¨Åes an MWC‚Äôs initial constraints and requires greater cardio- respiratory and muscular exertion on behalf of persons in relation to their physiological capacities (Collins et al., 2012, Meyers et al., 2002). Although the peak oxygen uptakes of MWC sportsmen  1 min  1 (Bhambhani, 2002; Haisma et al., may exceed 35 ml kg 2006; Huonker et al., 1998; Van der Woude et al., 2001), these ca-  1 min  1 for many users pacities are less than 20, even 15 ml kg (Figoni, 1984; Haisma et al., 2006; Tahamont et al., 1986). Additional constraints like cross slope (Cs) which is the slope that is perpen- dicular to the direction of travel, can thus degrade MWC user social life and state of health by increasing musculo-skeletal disorders (Burnham and Steadward, 1994; Mercer et al., 2006; Van Drongelen  * Corresponding author.

Indeed, Cs causes gyratory action of the chair‚Äôs front wheels, which generate a force that tends to pull the ‚Äúsubject- wheelchair‚Äù combination to the lower side and requires users to Ô¨Åght against this force in order to keep a straight course (Cooper, 1990; Van der Woude et al., 2001). A 2% Cs limit is regulatory in many countries (McMillen et al., 1999), but this may not always be respected. Furthermore, no result really prompts justiÔ¨Åcation of this 2% established Cs limit. In fact few studies have focused on MWC movements on a Cs. A recent review by Cooper et al. (2011) only lists Ô¨Åve such studies. Three were mainly directed towards the biomechanical aspects of wheelchair propulsion (Brubaker et al., 1986; Chesney and Axelson, 1996; Richter et al., 2007). The other two addressed the problems of travelling on varied surfaces, some with a Cs, experienced by populations suffering from various pathologies (Longmuir et al., 2003; Kockelman et al., 2001). Only the Brubaker et al. (1986) and the Kockelman et al. (2001) studies included physiological measurements. Despite the disparity in these studies an overview reveals that Cs limits of between 16 and 20% for short distances (Chesney and Axelson, 1996) and for longer journeys, a 4% Cs is acceptable for all users and a more critical 10% limit should never be exceeded (Kockelman et al., 2001). These values are very far from the 2% regulatory limit (McMillen et al., 1999).  
B. Pierret et al.  / Applied Ergonomics 45 (2014) 1056e1062  1057  With a view to proposing a rationalised allowable Cs, the pre- sent study sets out to determine the cardio-respiratory and sub- jective strains involved in MWC travel under real propulsion conditions on different Cs and at two travelling velocities for a large number of regular MWC users.  2.  Equipment and methods  The study was conducted in the occupational physiology labora- tory at the Institut National de Recherche et de S√©curit√© (INRS) jointly with the Institut R√©gional de m√©decine physique et de R√©adaptation (IRR) both located in Nancy in the eastern part of France.  2.1.  Subjects  The 25 volunteer subjects were recruited from patients moni- tored at the IRR, based on the following inclusion criteria: men, paraplegic, adult and of working age (18e65 years old), travelling independently and regularly in an MWC for more than 6 months. Injury level was deÔ¨Åned as ‚Äúhigh‚Äù for injuries at or higher than the 6th thoracic vertebra, and as ‚Äúlow‚Äù for injuries of the 7th thoracic vertebra or lower who have functional abdominal muscles. Subjects have no contraindication (cardiovascular, pulmonary, muscular, skin and/or developing general pathologies). They were informed of the study protocol and gave their written consent. The study received approval from the local ethical committee.  2.2.  Protocol  Two tests were performed: a test involving sub-maximal exer- tion on an arm ergocycle and a propulsion track test. The arm cranking test was conducted on a Ô¨Årst half-day dedicated to the study inclusion medical examination. A second full-day was dedi- cated to the track propulsion testing. At least two rest days sepa- rated the two test sessions to eliminate fatigue from the cranking test. Both tests were conducted under medical surveillance.  2.2.1.  Cranking test  The sub-maximal arm cranking test was conducted on an arm ergocycle Ô¨Åtted with a magnetic induction braking system ensuring power control (Upper Body Cycle, Kardiomed√í). This test allowed to estimate the peak oxygen uptake (VO2max) of the subjects through extrapolating the relationship between HR and VO2 to their HRmax (Par√© et al., 1993). The test started with a 2-min, 25 W warm-up step before continuing in 2-min steps with an increase of 10 W per step. Pedalling frequency was 50 rotations per minute. The test was stopped when the subjects reached 85% of their rate (HRmax ¬º 220 e age in years) theoretical maximum heart (Wilmore and Costill, 2004).  insured physiological parameter stability (Wilmore and Costill, 2004). The order of testing of the 8 conditions was random. The propulsion method was free. The travelling direction con- ditions the dominant body side in the most demanding side i.e. in the steeper Cs. The subjects used their own MWC. Wheel diameter was 24 inches and tyres were inÔ¨Çated to a pressure of 8 bar.  1), constant for the 4 Cs, was The imposed velocity Vi (0.97 m s monitored by electroluminescent diodes Ô¨Åxed every 2 m along the walls bordering the test track. The subjects adjusted the travelling velocity based on delayed lighting of the diodes. The Vi and the Vc, chosen by the subject, were measured by timing at each lap. Temperature and relative humidity were measured for each half- day using a portable hygro-thermometer (RH70, Omega√í).  2.3. Measured variables  The measured physiological parameters were heart rate (HR in  1 min  1) and carbon dioxide bpm), oxygen uptake (VO2 in ml kg  1 min  1). Subjective strain was assessed production (VCO2 in ml kg based on the Rating of Perceived Exertion (RPE) scale (Borg, 1998). HR was measured continuously for the whole day using a cardio frequency meter (Polar√í, S 810 i) with a count integration time of 15 s. Cardiac strain parameters were: a) the HR, b) the absolute cardiac cost (ACC in bpm), which is the difference between the mean HR during the test and the HR when seated and at rest, c) the relative cardiac cost (RCC in %), which expresses the percentage strain of the HR reserve (HRR), which is the difference between the subject‚Äôs HRmax and his HR at rest (Wilmore and Costill, 2004). The RCC is determined by the ACC/HRR ratio. Respiratory parameters were recorded using a cycle-to-cycle gas analyser telemetric system (Cosmed K4b2√í). The respiratory parameters processed were: a) the VO2, b) the energetic cost per  1 kg  1) and, c) metre travelled and per kg weight (ECmkg in J m the relative energetic cost (REC in %). The ECmkg is the product of the oxygen cost (cVO2) by the energy equivalent of 1 L of  1) oxygen (k in kJ l divided by the velocity and the weight (P ¬º subject √æ MWC weight in kg); ECmkg ¬º cVO2 k/V.P. The  1 min  1) is the difference between the oxygen cost (cVO2 in ml kg mean VO2 during the test and the VO2 at rest. The energy equiv- k ¬º 16.6 √æ 4.6 RQ, alent of 1 L of oxygen is calculated using the equation in which the respiratory quotient (RQ) is the ratio VCO2/VO2. The REC represents the fraction of the oxygen reserve involved in the exercise. REC is the ratio between the cVO2 and the oxygen reserve (VO2R), equal to VO2maxeVO2rest (Wilmore and Costill, 2004). Subjective strain was obtained using the RPE scale (Borg, 1998). A global and 5 local assessments (back, shoulders, upper limbs) were asked for at the end of each track test.  2.2.2.  Propulsion test  2.4.  Statistical analysis  The propulsion test was performed on a 50 m long test track specially designed for the study. Two opposite straights were each 24 m long and the subjects travelled back and forth on these. The track was 1.2 m wide in compliance with wheelchair route mini- mum width. The wooden track was covered with surfacing material (Tarasafe super, GerÔ¨Çor√í) with a dynamic friction coefÔ¨Åcient of 0.4 (ua) close to that of an average asphalt pavement (0.38 u.a.). The track Cs was mechanically adjusted and checked using an electronic level (Laser Cross Liner Novipro, Bosch√í). The subjects were submitted to 8 experimental conditions combining 4 Cs (0, 2, 8 and 12%) and 2 velocities: one imposed (Vi ¬º 0.97 m s  1), the other so-called ‚Äúcomfortable‚Äù (Vc), chosen by the subjects themselves. Under each of the 8 conditions, the subjects undertook 6 laps (300 m) around the track; this distance  Results are expressed by their mean and standard deviation (SD) shown in brackets for the 25 subjects. Student t tests on the paired samples allow us to analyse the effects of Cs on: travelling velocity (Vc and Vi), HR, VO2 and subjective strains. Distribution normality was checked and achieved by variable transform if needed. Three-factor variance analyses (ANOVA) with correction for co-variable effects qualify the effects of Cs, velocity and injury level on the cardiac, energetic and subjective strains. Simple and multiple regression models based on the least square method were used to establish the relationships between the different variables. A 5% signiÔ¨Åcance threshold was retained (p < 0.05). Statistical analyses were conducted using Statgraphics√í Centurion XVI software.

Moreover, for the 0 and 2% Cs conditions, there was no signiÔ¨Åcant differ- ence in both HR and VO2 (F1.592 < 0.6; p > 0.4). These observa- tions led us to process only the data for laps 3, 4 and 5 and to group the results of the physiological strains at 0 and 2% Cs denoted 0/2%.

The energetic strain increases when individual factors, such as age (p < 0.001) and BMI (p < 0.001) increase or when physical activity (p < 0.001), injury level (p < 0.01) or VO2max (p < 0.001) decrease. The mean respiratory quotient (RQ) are signiÔ¨Åcantly different for the three Cs studied (F2.579 ¬º 23; p < 0.001). For the 12% Cs, the RQ at Vc (0.98) is signiÔ¨Åcantly (p < 0.01) higher than at Vi (0.93). Additionally, for the 0/2% Cs, the RQ does not change when laps are performed, while it increases regularly and signiÔ¨Åcantly (p < 0.01) for the 8% and 12% Cs. The RQ of half the subjects exceeds 1 at the end of the test at Vc on the 12% Cs. The mean RQ of the subjects with a ‚Äúlow‚Äù level injury (0.92) is signiÔ¨Åcantly (p < 0.02) higher than that of the subjects with a ‚Äúhigh‚Äù level injury (0.89) and neither the Cs nor the velocity alters this difference.  3.3.3.  Subjective strains  The subjective rating results remain unaltered by the velocity (p > 0.4), but the Cs increases signiÔ¨Åcantly the subject rating (p < 0.001). The mean estimation is 7.8 (1.8) for the 0/2%, 9.9 (2.6) for the 8% and 11.9 (3.4) for the 12% Cs, equivalent to very light, light and moderate on the Borg scale respectively. The RPE increases with BMI (F1.199 ¬º 5.5; p < 0.02). It is signiÔ¨Åcantly (p < 0.001) higher (RPE ¬º 9.9 (0.6)) for subjects with ‚Äúlow‚Äù level injuries than for those with ‚Äúhigh‚Äù level injuries, who rated RPE as 8.5 (0.7). Finally, the Cs is only perceived at 8% and at 12%.

Strains variations  Fig. 1 illustrates the variations in the 3 strains (cardiac, energetic and subjective) at 2 velocities and 4 Cs studied. Results in Fig. 1 reveal a virtually linear variation in strains for Cs between 0/2% and 12%. This illustrates the fact that, under the conditions of this study, the linear models representing Eqs. (1) and (2) are not improved by non-linear modelling.  Fig. 1. Mean strains and standard deviations for the 4 cross slopes and 2 travelling velocities.

Discussion  4.2.  Subjects characteristics  Our discussion will address in succession points concerning methodology, subject characteristics and travelling velocities before analysing the strain levels for different Cs and comparing these with data in the literature. At the end of this discussion, we propose a Cs limit model.  4.1. Methodology  Unlike the majority of studies published to date, the results of this work are based on a large number of paraplegic subjects (25) accustomed to travelling in an MWC. However, this subject ‚Äúuni- formity‚Äù is only partial since there is great variability between in- dividuals as shown by the standard deviations for the results displayed in Tables 2 and 3. Although this variability may be partly explained by subject age, BMI, VO2max, physical activity and trav- elling velocity, it is not totally remedied by taking into account individual variables (Eqs. (1) and (2)). This testiÔ¨Åes to the complex nature of MWC travel, involving unconsidered parameters, such as user technique and training, wheelchair adaptation, strength ca- pacities, efÔ¨Åciency variation with respect to Cs or velocity (Cooper, 1990; Par√© et al., 1993; Van der Woude et al., 2001). In the present study it was not possible to monitor accurately power unbalance between the 2 upper limbs and MWC speed and trajectories. This was due to space limitations in the experimental corridor and impossibility to equip the MWC of each subject. In consequence, the effects of biomechanical factors of the MWC movement are not considered while they could explain part of the individual vari- ability. Our choice of 4 Cs (0, 2, 8 and 12%) was made to try to understand this complexity, built a strain model and to take in account the 2% regulatory reference slope adopted in many coun- tries (McMillen et al., 1999) and the acceptable Cs of 10% (Kockelman et al., 2001) which explains the choice of 8 and 12% Cs  1) as upper anchor of the strain model. The Vi (0.97 m s is used fairly conventionally (Brubaker et al., 1986; Mukherjee and Samanta, 2001) and was easy to be maintained constant. The a priori decision to perform 6 laps has been validated since it allows 3 stable laps from physiological and velocities point of view.   1  The 25 active male subjects had a mean VO2max of 25.0 (5.5)  1 min  1, which compares with the highest data ml kg in the literature for paraplegic MWC users who are not sportsmen (Van der Woude et al., 2001; Bhambhani, 2002) and exceeds the most  1 min frequently quoted values between 15 and 25 ml kg (Hjeltnes, 1986; Figoni, 1984; Veeger et al., 1991). In a less active population than that studied, Cs generated strains would un- doubtedly be greater than those observed in the present study. While at Vc, the 12% Cs represents an energetic strain of 52% in the study population (Table 3), it would represent 75% of the maximum capacity for a less active population with a VO2max of only  1 min  1. Cs consequences would undoubtedly be even 20 ml kg more constraining for a more fragile, older and less active population. The results reveal the surprising effects of injury level on Vc and RQ. Subjects with ‚Äúhigh‚Äù level injuries, who have no functional abdominal musculature, in fact chose a mean Vc that was signiÔ¨Å-  1) cantly (p < 0.05) faster (1.25 m s than those with ‚Äúlow‚Äù level  1). This difference is signiÔ¨Åcant injuries (1.18 m s for all Cs. The literature offers no explanation for this phenomenon. Maintaining a straighter trajectory may require users to travel faster. Lack of trunk stability could also cause paraplegics with ‚Äúhigh‚Äù level in- juries to lean more on the handrails to keep in balance, which would also result in a higher Vc. Moreover, the trunk Ô¨Çexion amplitude should be greater for a ‚Äúhigh‚Äù level injury (Chow et al., 2000). These hypotheses could not be veriÔ¨Åed in this study. Even lower RQ for ‚Äúhigh‚Äù level injured users could be interpreted as less muscles involved or less respiratory difÔ¨Åculties for them as for the ‚Äúlow‚Äù level injured users. Thus, trunk Ô¨Çexion could be used to reduce energetic and respiratory strains. The Vc is signiÔ¨Åcantly different for 0% and 2% Cs, yet no other result reveals a difference between travelling on the Ô¨Çat and over a 2% Cs. This result makes Vc a powerful strain indicator for assessing the difÔ¨Åculty of a travelling condition. The exertion perceived by the subjects with ‚Äúlow‚Äù level injuries (RPE ¬º 9.9) was higher (p < 0.001) than that perceived by subjects injuries (RPE ¬º 8.5), who nevertheless travelled with ‚Äúhigh‚Äù level  
1060  B. Pierret et al.  / Applied Ergonomics 45 (2014) 1056e1062  faster without signiÔ¨Åcantly different energetic (p > 0.5) or cardiac (p > 0.3) strains. The day-to-day life of a paraplegic with a ‚Äúhigh‚Äù level injury is more trying and complex than that of a paraplegic with a ‚Äúlow‚Äù level injury. The former could sustain a higher difÔ¨Å- culty set-point, which would allow him to confront more easily an identical constraint and have a more positive perception of the laboratory situation than the user with a ‚Äúlow‚Äù level injury. Furthermore, depending on the experimental condition, a ‚Äúhigh‚Äù injury level does not always cause signiÔ¨Åcant alteration in capac- ities (Vanlandewijck et al., 2011). These factors, which have not been demonstrated in this study, could explain the exertion perception differences in relation to injury level.  4.3.  Physiological strains  Between the situation at Vi with a 0/2% Cs and at Vc with a 12% Cs, the mean cardiac strains are multiplied by 2.5 (Table 2) and the energetic strains by 3 (Table 3). More precisely, the 0e12% Cs multiplies the strains by 2 and the change from Vi to Vc multiplies them by 1.5. Except for the 12% Cs, the subjects‚Äô HR and VO2 strains remain moderate. For comparison, the cardiac strains in this study are signiÔ¨Åcantly lower than those measured on a Ô¨Çat surface at similar velocities: 127 bpm (Mukherjee and Samanta, 2001). The values of HR, ACC and RCC measured at Vc for a given Cs condition are very close to the values measured for the higher Cs condition at Vi. As an example, the ACC at Vc for a 0/2% Cs is 33.7 (12.9) bpm and is 34.5 (14.0) bpm at Vi for an 8% Cs. Thus, it is important to inform MWC users that their velocity is a major strain factor and must be adapted to the environment. The relative energetic cost is equiva- lent to the relative cardiac cost (Tables 2 and 3). The energetic cost per meter (ECm) is related to the travelling velocity. Under the 0/2% Cs condition, ECm is 93 J m at the imposed velocity Vi  1). This result echoes the Brubaker et al. (1986) study, in (0.94 m s  1 for a 0% Cs at a similar trav- which ECm was found to be 97 J m elling velocity. Subjective strains, at the opposite of the objective ones are not signiÔ¨Åcantly different in relation to the travelling velocity on the same Cs. Choosing a so-called ‚Äúcomfortable‚Äù velocity causes the subjects to sustain an increase in cardio-respiratory strain, which is not subjectively perceived. Velocity control would appear to minimise the perceived exertion, but may expose the subject to a risk of overload in terms of physiological strains.   1  4.4.  Comparison with literature data  Studies that have focused on Cs have not addressed the physi- ological aspect or have, but based on a few subjects. To validate the data provided by this study, we can compare them with physio- logical cost data for Ô¨Çat ground. Table 4 consolidates the ACC, cVO2  1 m  1) values with respect to travelling velocity on the Ô¨Çat. (ml kg The studies retained were conducted on a minimum of 9 subjects and involved measuring the HR and/or VO2. Results in Table 4 show very close energetic costs per meter and weight.

The cVO2 cost is 0.134 (0.015) ml kg small differences observed in Table 4 can probably be related to subject Ô¨Åtness, travelling conditions or MWC technology.

Indeed, the V slope in Eq. (2) is the same as that from the whole results of Table 4.  Table 4 Comparison of physiological strains when travelling in an MWC on Ô¨Çat ground.

(1970) study, conducted on a widely varied population, suggests equivalents in watts (W) of travelling on Ô¨Çat ground in an MWC (18 kg √æ 70 kg subject) at velocities of 0.3 m s  1 (4 W), 0.8 m s  1 (6.5 W) and 1.1 m s  1 (11 W), i.e. (2 W), 0.55 m s an equivalent of 8.7 and 16 W at Vi and Vc respectively. For these authors, the efÔ¨Åciency on the Ô¨Çat lies between 5% and 8%. In this study, the mean energetic cost of travelling on Ô¨Çat ground is 100 W at Vi and 182 W at Vc, i.e. an efÔ¨Åciency of 8.7% for both velocities, which corresponds to a normal result in view of MWC progress, along with the capacities of our study subjects (Van der Woude et al., 1988). Finally, a number of studies (Van der Woude et al., 1989, 2001) have enabled relationships between ACC (bpm) and VO2  1 min  1) with respect to velocity (V in m s  1) and slope (S in (ml kg ACC ¬º 31.4V √æ 12.1 %) to be derived in the form: and VO2 ¬º 10.1V √æ 3.8 S. Based on these relationships, 1% slope increases  1 min  1. From the the ACC by 12 bpm and the VO2 by 3.8 ml kg results of the present study (Eqs. (1) and (2)) Cs will be 8.3%, based on the energetic cost, and 5.3%, based on the cardiac cost, to reach the strains at 1% slope. These results do not agree with the data provided by Chesney and Axelson (1996), who considered that a 1% slope induces a power equivalent to a 3% Cs, in other words a cost that is 2 times higher than that extrapolated from the results of this study. The differences between Chesney and Axelson (1996), Richter et al. (2007), Van der Woude et al. (1989) results and ours explain that cardio-respiratory strains cannot be compared to physical strains, at least when propelling an MWC. Using only the later to model strains can involve large and dangerous errors. MWC literature focuses, above all, on the technical and biomechanical data for improving exertion efÔ¨Åciency (Van der Woude et al., 2001) and on the maximum capacities of sportsmen in MWCs (Huonker et al., 1998; Par√© et al., 1993; Van der Woude et al., 2001; Veeger et al., 1991). The main aim of MWC studies conducted between 1975 and 1995 was to improve wheelchairs by taking advantage of the wheelchair sports boom (Cooper, 1990). During this period, Boston (USA) and Oita (Japan) marathon winning times dropped from over 2.5 h to less than 1.5 h. This progress was made possible by improving the technical and technological characteristics of wheelchairs (weight, stabilities, wheels, propulsion, etc.) and adopting efÔ¨Åciency optimising postures (Van der Woude et al., 2001). This explains why physiological data have been so little measured on large numbers of habitual MWC users since research directed towards technical and mechanical data effectively revealed much more reÔ¨Åned improvements than physiological data (Van der Woude et al., 2001). The signiÔ¨Åcant effect of a 2% Cs on Vc supports this idea, even though it does not alter the strains.  
B. Pierret et al.  / Applied Ergonomics 45 (2014) 1056e1062  1061  4.5.  Strain model  Observation of the data illustrated in Fig. 1 shows that the relationship between Cs and both physiological costs can be considered linear (Chesney and Axelson, 1996; Kockelman et al., 2001). If all variables are otherwise constant, the mean Cs (in %) cost can be quantiÔ¨Åed using the following equations:  cVO2 ¬º 4:6 √æ 0:4Cs  n ¬º 583;  r ¬º :51  ACC ¬º 25:6 √æ 2:0Cs  n ¬º 568;  r ¬º :54  If we consider that a 50%-of-maximum strain can be easily maintained for several hundred meters (long term) and that a 75%- of-maximum strain can be maintained for several tens of meters (short term), we can establish long- and short-term Cs limits based on the 2 physiological costs (Monod and Kapitaniak, 2009). For energetic cost (VO2rest ¬º 4.1 ml kg  1 min  1) users with a VO2max  1 min  1 can travel on a 2% Cs for several hundred of of 15 ml kg meters and can travel several tens of meters on a 8% Cs. If their  1 min  1, which is undoubtedly the most VO2max is 20 ml kg common among these wheelchair users, they can confront a 19% short-term Cs, potentially causing a major risk of imbalance. On the other hand, they will be capable of travelling over no more than an 8% Cs in the long term. For subjects with a VO2max of  1 min  1, there is no short-term limitation and the long 25 ml kg term one (15%) is risky. For higher VO2max values, Cs limitation is no longer rational. The cardiac strains of the subjects in this study were too low to be able to derive a credible limiting model based on HR since no Cs limit was less than 12%. However, if an ACC of 30 bpm would be a cardiac cost limit (Monod and Kapitaniak, 2009), this would only be respected if the Cs was less than 2%.  5.  Conclusion  The results of this study show that: i) a 2% Cs was indistin- guishable from Ô¨Çat ground in terms of cardio-respiratory and subjective strains, ii) the physiological strain increases linearly with Cs, iii) an 8% Cs is subjectively sensitive and impose noteworthy physiological costs and do not allow the RQ to stabilise, iv) a 12% Cs is unachievable for some users and should therefore be prohibited, v) limiting Cs at 8% enables the subjects taking part in this study to remain below 50% of their functional capacities. These limits cannot be generalised. For users with low cardio- respiratory capacities, a model derived from the results of this study shows that the 2% Cs limit allows all MWC users to travel. In practice, an environment in which there are no 8% Cs and there is a trend for compliance with the regulatory limit of 2% should encourage a great majority of people in MWCs to travel. These conditions allow acquisition of independence, conservation of functional capacities and promotion of health. Furthermore, they would favour integration of employees in MWCs.

s0003687014000040,"  The human body is exposed to indoor and outdoor environ- ments during daily life. A comfortable outdoor climate leads to a comfortable indoor environment (Ahmed, 2003). Song et al. (2012) found that a person who comes indoors from a hot outdoor envi- ronment sets the air conditioner to a low temperature because the heated human body should be cooled to a comfortable temperature range. Thermal sensation and thermal physiology are affected by the state of the outdoor environment and the time spent outdoors, and the outdoor climate affects clothing style and the clothing insulation value (Nikolopoulou et al., 2001). Thermal comfort the- ory has been developed based on psychological responses; the acceptable temperature range is calculated using the subjective thermal sensation vote (TSV) (Fanger, 1970; ISO 7730, 1994; ASHRAE Standard 55, 2004). Psychological responses are used to evaluate productivity indoors (Parsons, 2003). However, many people enjoy hot saunas, and some people like swimming during the cold winter season. These preferences cannot be explained by the traditional thermal comfort theory. Physiological responses are used to evaluate the health of humans exposed to different thermal environments. The skin temperature and blood Ô¨Çow rate can be used to assess the quality of a healthy space.  * Tel.: √æ82 32 610 3306; fax: √æ82 32 610 3223. E-mail addresses: songsup@bc.ac.kr, songsup306@gmail.com.  The environment is sometimes extreme in a transitional space or outdoors. During the summer, the outdoor temperature is extremely high, and during the winter, this temperature is extremely low. The human body should maintain homeostasis; therefore, human thermal behaviours have been developed to allow people to adapt to extreme environments. The level of clothing insulation varies, with light clothes worn during the summer and heavy clothes worn during the winter. A person‚Äôs metabolism can be changed by low-speed or brisk walking. When a person is exposed to an extreme environment, the person feels uncomfortable, and blood Ô¨Çow is controlled by vasomotor func- tions. If the body is exposed to an extremely cold environment, blood Ô¨Çow is minimised to maintain homeostasis. In contrast, if the body is exposed to an extremely hot environment, blood Ô¨Çow is maximised along with sweating to dissipate heat from the body‚Äôs core (Schimidt and Thews, 1989). A high blood Ô¨Çow rate indicates that high levels of oxygen are transported to cells. This high-oxygen environment induces oxidative stress and the dysfunction of hor- mones, and the DNA can be damaged (Marczynska et al., 1980; Ivell, 2007; Song, 2010). Exposure to low temperatures induces pain (Yarnitsky and Ochoa, 1991), cold drafts (Griefahn et al., 2001) and the loss of manual dexterity (Heus et al., 1995). Tissue ischemia leads to limited angiogenesis and associated disorders, such as Raynaud‚Äôs phenomena, pain, numbness, paleness, cyanosis swelling, or tingling. Furthermore, exposure to extremely cold environments can result in tissue necrosis (Yu et al., 2006).

G.-S. Song / Applied Ergonomics 45 (2014) 1048e1055  1049  should mitigate these extreme outdoor environments and serve as a comfortable shelter for occupants. Several researchers have investigated changes in the blood Ô¨Çow rate depending on the indoor environment. Song (2008) measured the blood Ô¨Çow in the toe contacting a Ô¨Çoor‚Äôs surface and reported that the blood Ô¨Çow rate increased proportionally with the skin temperature of the foot. Song argued that the surface temperature of the Ô¨Çoor should be maintained in the range of 23e33  C. Tanaka et al. (2003) investigated peripheral blood Ô¨Çow in the hands and feet. They concluded that an ambient temperature of 17 C may be too low for comfort due to decreased blood Ô¨Çow. These studies were performed in an artiÔ¨Åcial climate chamber, and the duration of the experiment was short (approximately three months). Human responses in climate chambers are different from responses in the Ô¨Åeld, and the human body changes seasonally. Studies on blood Ô¨Çow performed in the Ô¨Åeld and covering all seasons are limited. The aim of the current study was to investigate the seasonal changes in blood Ô¨Çow in the Ô¨Åeld. The Ô¨Ångertip blood Ô¨Çow was measured during (1) the summer, which is hot and humid; (2) the autumn, which is mild and comfortable; and (3) the winter, which is cold and dry. The purpose of this work was to elucidate the inÔ¨Çuence of indoor and outdoor environments on blood Ô¨Çow.  2.  Subjects and methods  2.1.  Subjects  Many students know that physiological experiments using hu- man subjects are performed continuously in the author‚Äôs labora- tory. Three research staff supported this study, and their friends and classmates were recruited as subjects. After preparing the experi- mental protocol, a research staff member posted a recruitment announcement on the bulletin board at Bucheon University and used a smart phone message system. The notice explained that students with severe cardiovascular, pulmonary, renal or other diseases were not eligible to participate in the experiment (Frank et al., 1999). Because obesity can inÔ¨Çuence thermal sensations (Magnusdottir et al., 2005; Cho et al., 2013; Tanaka et al., 2003), only subjects with a BMI (body mass index) below 25 were eligible. The length of time since consuming a meal also affects blood Ô¨Çow (Munkelwitz and Gilbert, 1998; Song et al., 2012), and subjects were not allowed to eat for 1 h prior to the experiment. The research staff informed the applicants that the blood Ô¨Çow measurements would be taken by attaching a probe to the Ô¨Ångertip. The Laser Doppler Meter is a non-invasive tool that is used to measure blood Ô¨Çow. Applicants who agreed to the terms of the investigation provided written consent. A total of 58 healthy stu- dents (33 males and 25 females) were recruited. The mean age, height, weight, and body mass index (BMI) were22.7  2.94 years, 169.4  8.9 cm, 62.1  12.3 kg and 21.52  2.91, respectively. The subjects that participated in the investigation were paid 20,000 Korean Won (approximately18 US dollars) for participating. The clothing insulation value (Clo) of the subjects was not controlled. All subjects wore their clothes as normal according to their personal habits or the weather conditions. When a subject arrived at the laboratory, he or she was asked to check his or her clothes, and a research staff member calculated the clothing insu- lation value according to the recommendation of ASHRAE Standard 55 (2004).  2.2.  Experimental procedure  The blood Ô¨Çow rate was measured in the middle left Ô¨Ångertip using a Laser Doppler Meter (Model: BLF21, Transonic Systems Inc., New York, USA). Because the blood Ô¨Çow rate constantly Ô¨Çuctuates  (Song, 2008), it should be measured dozens of times per second. The DI-158U Data Logger (DATAQ Instrument Inc., Ohio, USA) is designed to appropriately measure the Ô¨Çuctuating blood Ô¨Çow rate. The blood Ô¨Çow rate was measured 50 times per second using the aforementioned tools. The Ô¨Årst measurement of the blood Ô¨Çow rate was performed for duration of 10 min after the subjects arrived at the laboratory. The second measurement was performed over 10 min after the subjects had left the laboratory and walked outdoors from the school to the subway station (20 min). During the walk, the climate conditions were measured using a portable temperature and humidity recorder (Model: TR-72S, T and D Corporation, Japan), each subject put the portable recorder into a small bag, and the sensor that measured temperature and humidity was located outside of the bag. The subjects were asked that the sensor should not come into contact with the subject‚Äôs body. Data on the insolation and wind speed were obtained from the Bucheon weather station. After the second blood Ô¨Çow measurement, the subjects entered a classroom and studied for 120 min. The third blood Ô¨Çow rate measurement was taken over 10 min after the subjects had studied for 2 h. The number of measurements was 105 during the summer, when air conditioning was used; 63 during the autumn, when no air conditioning was used; and 96 during the winter, when heating was used. A total of 264 measurements were taken. Fig. 1 shows how the blood Ô¨Çow measurements were taken during the summer, and Fig. 2 shows the composition of the measuring instruments. Fig. 3 shows a subject and the data logging system in the winter after the subject had arrived at the classroom after walking for 20 min in the cold outdoor conditions of the winter season.  2.3. Outdoor thermal conditions  Korea has four seasons, and during the winter, a heating system should be used because the climate is very cold. During the sum- mer, a cooling system is often used due to the hot weather condi- tions, and during the spring and autumn, air conditioning systems are not operated because the climate is mild. Measurements were taken between July 20, 2010 and January 06, 2011 to estimate the blood Ô¨Çow rate during multiple seasons. During the summer, from July 20, 2010 to September 17, 2010, a cooling system was operated, and during the autumn, from September 30, 2010 to November 13, 2010, an air conditioning  Fig. 1.

The signiÔ¨Åcant (p ¬º 0.000). The average outdoor relative humidity was difference in the air temperature between seasons was statistically 64.6  12.86% 51.6  15.86% during the summer, during the autumn, and 54.9  19.18% during the winter, and the differences between seasons were not signiÔ¨Åcant. The average insolation dur- ing the winter was 0.83  0.32 MJ/m2, the smallest value for (1.74  0.75 MJ/ the three seasons. The differences between summer m2) and autumn (1.53  0.56 MJ/m2) were statistically signiÔ¨Åcant (p < 0.01). The average air velocity was 3.2  1.03 m/s during the summer, 2.8 m/s during the autumn and 4.1 m/s during the winter. The differences between seasons were not signiÔ¨Åcant. During the summer, an air conditioning system was operated, and consequently, the indoor air temperature was maintained be- tween 24 and 27 C. During the autumn, the air conditioning sys- tem was not operated, and the room air temperature was ranged between 22 and 27  C. During the winter, a heating system was operated, and the indoor air temperature was ranged between 20 and 23  C.  3.2.  Changes in the clothing insulation value  Each subject‚Äôs clothing insulation value (Clo) was calculated according to the ASHRAE Standard 55 recommendations. The average clothing insulation value was 0.52  0.076 Clo during the summer, 0.90  0.242 Clo during the autumn and 1.09  0.276 Clo during the winter. Table 2 presents the seasonal average Clo. The Clo value during the summer was signiÔ¨Åcantly different from those during the autumn and winter (p < 0.001), but the difference in Clo value between autumn and winter was not signiÔ¨Åcant (p ¬º 0.06). Fig. 4 shows the proÔ¨Åle of the changes in clothing insulation value according to the outdoor climate. The Clo was inversely proportional to the outdoor air temperature, and the relationship between the Clo and the outdoor air temperature was statistically signiÔ¨Åcant (p < 0.01). Based on this result, it can be inferred that changing the Clo is a strong thermal adaptation behaviour used to maintain comfort.  3.3.  Blood Ô¨Çow rate  Table 3 shows the results of the measurements of the blood Ô¨Çow rate. The Ô¨Årst blood Ô¨Çow rate measurement was taken over 10 min when the subjects arrived at the laboratory; they had been exposed to various environments, including indoor and outdoor environ- ments. The second blood Ô¨Çow rate measurement was taken after the subjects had walked for 20 min; during the walk, they were exposed to the ambient outdoor environment. The third blood Ô¨Çow rate measurement was taken after the subjects had spent 2 h in class; during this time, they were exposed to an indoor environ- ment that was cooled during the summer, not cooled or heated during the autumn, and heated during the winter season. After walking for 10 min, the average blood Ô¨Çow rate was 45.75  25.79 TPU (tissue perfusion units) during the summer, 27.69  12.33 TPU during the autumn and 18.18  17.22 TPU during the winter. During the summer, the average ambient temperature was 30.30  1.93  C, and during this season, the highest blood Ô¨Çow 45.75  25.79 TPU. rate was recorded, In contrast, during the temperature was 4.55  4.90  C, winter, the average ambient air and during this season, the lowest blood Ô¨Çow rate was measured, 18.18  17.22 TPU. The difference in the blood Ô¨Çow rate after walking outdoors for 20 min between summer and autumn was statistically signiÔ¨Åcant (p < 0.05), and the difference between summer and winter was also signiÔ¨Åcant (p < 0.001); however, the  Fig. 2.

Physical environment  Table 1 shows the results for the measurements of the outdoor environment. The outdoor air temperature and relative humidity were measured by the subjects using a portable recorder (Model: TR-72S, T and D Corporation, Japan), and the insolation and wind velocity values were obtained from the meteorological weather station in Bucheon. During the summer, the outdoor air tempera- ture ranged between 26.4 C and 33.7  C, and the average tem- perature was 30.3  1.93 C. During the mild season, autumn, the temperature was 19.4  2.25 C, and during the average outdoor  Fig. 3. Subjects and measurement of blood Ô¨Çow rate in winter season.

During the summer, when the air conditioning system was used, after 2 h of class, the blood Ô¨Çow rate decreased from 45.95  25.790 TPU to 36.14  21.837 TPU, and this change was Ô¨Çow rate after exposure to outdoor air was 27.69  12.334 TPU, and statistically signiÔ¨Åcant (p < 0.05).

During the winter when the heating system was used, after subjects the had been exposed to the outdoor environment for 20 min, the blood Ô¨Çow rate was 17.12  16.396 TPU, and after the subjects had been in class for 2 h, the blood Ô¨Çow rate was 15.00  11.623 TPU.

The difference between these was 7.22 TPU, which was statistically signiÔ¨Åcant (p < 0.05, n ¬º 14). The comparison of the data in Figs. 5 and 6 shows that, during the summer and autumn, the blood Ô¨Çow rate decreased after the subjects had been in class for 2 h. However, during the winter, when the outside air temperature was below 3  C, the blood Ô¨Çow  autumn  not  signiÔ¨Åcant  between  and winter was  difference (p ¬º 0.253). After the subjects had been in class for 2 h, the average blood 36.14  21.84 TPU Ô¨Çow rate was during the summer, 12.47  12.25 TPU during the autumn and 14.95  11.44 TPU during the winter season. The difference in the blood Ô¨Çow rate after being in class for 2 h between summer and autumn was 23.67 TPU, and this difference was statistically signiÔ¨Åcant (p < 0.001). The differ- ence in the blood Ô¨Çow between the summer and winter was 21.19 TPU, which was statistically signiÔ¨Åcant (p < 0.001). However, the difference in the blood Ô¨Çow between autumn and winter was not signiÔ¨Åcant (p ¬º 0.867). Fig. 5 shows the relationship between the blood Ô¨Çow rate and outdoor air temperature. The blood Ô¨Çood rate was measured when the subject had Ô¨Ånished a 20-min outdoors walks. The blood Ô¨Çow rate increased proportionally with the ambient air temperature (R2 ¬º 0.3092, p < 0.001). Interestingly, the minimum blood Ô¨Çow rate was increased when the outdoor temperature was above 5 C. The maximum blood Ô¨Çow rate also increased proportionally with the outdoor air temperature. Fig. 6 presents the blood Ô¨Çow rate in the Ô¨Ångertip after the subjects had been in class for 2 h. The subjects were exposed to the indoor air temperature. During the winter, the indoor air temper- ature was maintained between 20 and 23  C, and a heating system was operated when the outdoor air temperature was below 12 C. During the autumn, the indoor air temperature was between 20 and 26 C without cooling or heating, and during this time, the in the range of 12e25 C. During the outdoor temperature was summer, an air conditioning system was operated to maintain an temperature between 24 and 27  C, and the outdoor air indoor temperature was above 26 C (see Table 1 for details). The blood Ô¨Çow rate after the subjects had been in class for 2 h increased r2 ¬º 0.193, proportionally to the outdoor temperature (p < 0.01, n ¬º 88). The blood Ô¨Çow rate indoors was inÔ¨Çuenced by the outside weather conditions. However, the minimum value of the blood Ô¨Çow rate indoors did not increased proportionally to the outdoor air temperature. This phenomenon is in contrast to that presented in Fig. 5. Several subjects maintained a calm sedentary posture in the classroom. In contrast, subjects had to walk outside in the ambient  Table 2 Clothing insulation value (Clo) by season.

Blood Ô¨Çow pattern according to the environment  During the measurement of the blood Ô¨Çow rates of 88 subjects, several blood Ô¨Çow patterns were observed. Fig. 7 shows the blood Ô¨Çow pattern representing a comfortable body state; these data were obtained during the autumn. The heart rate was normal, and the blood Ô¨Çow was controlled not proportionally but intermittently by the external environment. During the autumn, subjects were exposed to ambient air temperatures of 13e24 C, and the blood Ô¨Çow rate Ô¨Çuctuated from 15 to 40 TPU. Fig. 8 shows a blood Ô¨Çow pattern representing the hot state. Generally, this pattern was observed during the hot summer season temperature was approximately 30 C. Many when the ambient subjects had blood Ô¨Çow patterns similar to that in Fig. 8. Although it was hot during the summer, low blood Ô¨Çow was observed when the subjects moved slowly (refer Fig. 5). By contrast, even though the season was mild and the ambient temperature was approximately 26  C, a pattern similar to that shown in Fig. 8 was observed when the subjects walked or ran at full speed. Fig. 9 shows a representative blood Ô¨Çow response when a sub- ject was in a cold state. The blood Ô¨Çow rate was below 10 TPU. This pattern was generally observed in the winter. When the outside ambient temperature was below 0 C and the subjects had walked outdoors for 20 min, most of the subjects had blood Ô¨Çow patterns similar to that in Fig. 9 (refer Fig. 5). In contrast, even during the summer, a blood Ô¨Çow pattern similar to that presented in Fig. 9 was  Fig. 6. Blood Ô¨Çow rate after spending 2 h in class indoors.  observed for several subjects after they had been in class for 2 h in an air-conditioned room (refer to Fig. 6). When subjects were sedentary and kept still in the classroom for 2 h, blood Ô¨Çow pat- terns similar to that in Fig. 9 were observed during every season. However, when the outdoor temperature was maintained above 30  C, the pattern shown in Fig. 9 was not observed.  4. Discussion  The blood Ô¨Çow rate is controlled to maintain homeostasis in a varying environment (Schimidt and Thews, 1989; Sakoi et al., 2007; Yao et al., 2007), and there are many factors that affect the blood Ô¨Çow rate, including sex, age, body build and composition, physical Ô¨Åtness level, the external environment, shivering, and the appli- cation of pressure to the tissue (Tanaka et al., 2003; ASHRAE, 2001; Burton and Bazett, 1936; Tomas, 1996; Vanos et al., 2010). ASHRAE (1993) documented that vasodilation is governed by a warm signal from the body core. For each 1 C increase above the neutral core temperature (36.8  C), blood Ô¨Çow increases by 56 g/s m2; m2 in- dicates the body surface area. Vasoconstriction is governed by a cold signal from the skin, for each 1 C decrease below the thermo  Fig. 5. Blood Ô¨Çow rate after walking for 20 min outdoors.  Fig. 7.

G.-S. Song / Applied Ergonomics 45 (2014) 1048e1055  1053  in the range of 13e26 C during the outdoor temperature was autumn, and the indoor temperature was between 20  C and 26 C even without the operation of a heating or cooling system. During this comfortable season, the average blood Ô¨Çow rate was 27.7  12.33 TPU after walking for 20 min outdoors, and it was 12.5  12.25 TPU indoors. According to previous research per- formed by Rock and Robinson (1965) and Powell and Blair (1994) showing that sedentary living habits are detrimental to human health, the blood Ô¨Çow rate outdoors is a meaningful value for hu- man health. In a comfortable and healthy environment, the average blood Ô¨Çow rate was 28 TPU, and the blood Ô¨Çow pattern was not constant but Ô¨Çuctuated between 15 TPU and 40 TPU. Parsons (2003) described the hierarchy systems in thermo regulation; a number of body systems cannot be affected by all desirable re- sponses. Thermoregulation is often relatively in competition for blood Ô¨Çow between systems. The Ô¨Çuctuating blood Ô¨Çow pattern was seen the result of competition with other systems. Previously, Lutzenhiser (1992) reported that occupants preferred manual operation to automatic temperature control based on the results of an air conditioner use survey. In the forum of ‚ÄòRoomvent 2009‚Äô, Zhu proposed that remaining in air-conditioned spaces for long periods has a negative effect on an occupant‚Äôs health and the body‚Äôs ability to thermoregulate (MOF3B in Roomvent, 2009, Busan). In a recent study, Song et al. (2012) investigated air conditioner operation behaviour, and they reported that students selected a Ô¨Çuctuating temperature range of 23.7e27.4 C and that the automatic control mode was never used to maintain a constant temperature. It is hypothesised that a comfortable and healthy environment is one in which the air temperature is not maintained at a constant tem- perature but Ô¨Çuctuates and in which the blood Ô¨Çow rate is not constant but Ô¨Çuctuates. The thermal behaviour of occupants is diverse and depends on many factors, including age; sex; clothing insulation value (Clo); activity (metabolism); posture (Parsons, 2003; Sakoi et al. 2007; Yao et al. 2007); emotions such as joy, love, fear, loneliness, stress and anger (Saldmann, 2008); cultural habits; race; location (Nicol et al., 1995); genetic characteristics (Song, 2010); personal disease history (Frank et al., 1999); obesity (Magnusdottir et al., 2005); the length of time since consuming a meal (Munkelwitz and Gilbert, 1998; Cho et al., 2013); wealth; social norms; and organisational policies (Charles, 2003). Among the various thermal behaviours, varying the clothing insulation value (Clo) is the most powerful thermal adaptation behaviour to maintain homeostasis in the hu- man body and to maintain comfort (Havenith et al., 2002; Nikolopoulou et al., 2001). In this investigation, the clothing insu- lation value was signiÔ¨Åcantly correlated with the outdoor air tem- perature (n ¬º 87, R2 ¬º 0.5749, p < 0.001). When our Ô¨Åndings are compared with previous investigations by Nikolopoulou et al. (2001), Koreans wore lighter clothing than Britons. During the autumn and winter, the Clo range was wider than during the summer season: 0.64e1.67 Clo during the autumn, 0.64e1.74 Clo during the winter and 0.26e0.66 Clo during the summer (see Table 2 for details). During the autumn, the clothing insulation value should be varied to adapt to the wide range of outdoor air temperatures (13e24 C). During the winter, due to the large dif- (20e23  C) and outdoor ference in temperature between indoor ( 3 to 12  C) environment, the Clo should be varied. In contrast, during the summer, the outdoor temperature was high (26e34  C), and the indoor temperature was also high (23e26  C); therefore, thin clothing is suitable for adaptation to these weather conditions. InsufÔ¨Åcient microcirculation leads to cold drafts, pain, numb- ness and cyanosis; skin can turn blue when the oxygen supply is depleted, and oxygen depletion can cause tissue ischemia, the loss of manual dexterity, delays in wound healing, delays in develop- ment and growth and eventually tissue necrosis (Griefahn et al.,  Fig. 8. Blood Ô¨Çow rate measured during the summer, representing a hot state.  neutral body skin temperature (33.7 C), there is a proportional resistance to blood Ô¨Çow on average. The skin temperature and core body temperature which are related to blood Ô¨Çow, are affected by exposed environments (Song and Seo, 2006; Song, 2008, 2010), and the skin temperature is consequently related to thermal comfort (Song, 2008; Sakoi et al., 2007; Yao et al. 2007; Vanos et al., 2010). In the present study, the blood Ô¨Çow rate in the Ô¨Ångertips was measured during different seasons with air temperatures ranging from  3 C to √æ34 C; this temperature range included almost all weather conditions that are experienced in Korea. This study revealed that the blood Ô¨Çow rate of subjects who exposed their body outdoors as well as indoors increased proportionally with the outdoor ambient temperature (p < 0.001). According to the thermal comfort theory, a comfortable tem- perature can be calculated based on psychological responses (subjective thermal sensation vote) from the PMV (predicted mean vote) value between  0.5 and √æ0.5 (Fanger, 1970; ISO 7730, 1994; ASHRAE Standard 55, 2004). In contrast, based on physiological responses, the comfortable and healthy temperature range is deÔ¨Åned as the environmental temperature range in which ho- meostasis can be maintained by controlling the blood Ô¨Çow rate without sweating or shivering (Schimidt and Thews, 1989; Song, 2010). During the autumn season in Korea, the use of a heating or cooling system is not required. Autumn is a comfortable and healthy season, and people can stay comfortable by varying their level of clothing insulation. In this investigation, the recorded  Fig. 9.

1054  G.-S. Song / Applied Ergonomics 45 (2014) 1048e1055  2001; Heus et al., 1995; Yu et al., 2006; Dano et al., 2001; Toyokawa et al., 2003; Kim et al., 2006). In this study, the blood Ô¨Çow decreased to below 10 TPU after exposure to cold outdoor temperatures when the outdoor air temperature was below 3 C during the winter (see Fig. 5 in detail). After the subjects had been in class for 2 h, the average blood Ô¨Çow rate was increased by approximately 7 TPU, and this increase was statistically signiÔ¨Åcant (p < 0.05). Warm indoor air increased the blood Ô¨Çow rate during the cold winter season. The operation of a heating system is important to increase microcirculation. Although the subjects stayed in the heated indoor classroom for 2 hours, for many subjects, the blood Ô¨Çow rate was below 10 TPU (see Figs. 5 and 6) when the subjects stayed still in a sitting posture in a chair. Furthermore, a low blood Ô¨Çow rate was found in several subjects even during the hot summer season, when an air condi- tioner was operated. Some women who work for a long time in an air-conditioned ofÔ¨Åce suffer menstrual disorders because this environment might reduce the level of angiogenesis. As shown in Figs. 5 and 6, the blood Ô¨Çow rate decreased in many subjects when moving from outdoors to indoors. A reduced level of angiogenesis can lead to many disorders and diseases (Kim, 2005; Powell and Blair, 1994). Fig. 9 shows the blood Ô¨Çow pattern after exposure to cold air. This type of pattern was observed for all subjects at air temperatures below 0 C. Cold-induced vasodilation (CIVD) is a process in which the blood vessels in the Ô¨Ångertips rapidly vaso- dilate approximately 5e10 min after the hand is exposed to cold conditions. CIVD is believed to reduce the risk of cold-induced injury (Daanen, 2003). As shown in Fig. 9, although the subjects were exposed to cold air, the blood Ô¨Çow rates were not always sustained at a low level; sometimes the blood Ô¨Çow rates increased. This phenomenon of hunting reaction protects against cold injuries and occurs not only when subjects are exposed to low tempera- tures but also when subjects are in indoor environments in which the temperature is regulated by air conditioning (see Fig. 6 for details). This phenomenon was not observed when the subjects were exposed to outdoor temperatures above 13  C. Exposure to mild outdoor air while walking outside is considered a good way to improve human health. It is well known that heat induces skin ageing, skin lesions, keratosis, and dermal elastosis; loss of elasticity in the skin (Arrington and Lockman, 1979; Schieke et al., 2003). Kim et al. (2006) suggested that the effects of heat play an important role in skin angiogenesis in humans. Furthermore, chronic or excessive exposure to heat increases the supply of oxygen to cells and leads to oxidative DNA damage (Marczynska et al., 1980; Ivell, 2007). Sperm quality is better during the winter than during the summer because the ambient temperature is lower during the winter than during the summer (Levine et al., 1992; Andolz et al., 2001; Chen et al., 2003; Chia et al., 2001). In this study, the average blood Ô¨Çow rate was 45.75  25.79 TPU when the subjects were outdoors during the summer, and the average blood Ô¨Çow rate decreased to 36.14  21.84 TPU when the subjects were indoors. The indoor environment mitigated the high blood Ô¨Çow rate (see Table 3). As shown in Fig. 5, the blood Ô¨Çow rate was indicative of extremely high perfusion in several subjects at outdoor air temperatures of approximately 30  C. This blood Ô¨Çow pattern is presented in Fig. 8. This phenomenon was not observed for all subjects. Five subjects among the 35 subjects exhibited high-perfusion blood Ô¨Çow. Sub- jects were not asked to walk at a high speed but were asked to walk at their normal speed. All subjects walked to or from home every day. The walking speed varied among subjects; several subjects walked at full speed, whereas several subjects walked very slowly. People are very sensitive to the heat when they walk outdoors during the hot summer season. This study found that the blood Ô¨Çow rate increased proportionally with the air temperature. This  increase in blood Ô¨Çow indicates an increased supply of oxygen to cells in the body. This oxidative stress is harmful to human health. Several researchers have proposed the use of urban greening to mitigate the extreme outdoor environment during the hot summer season; trees block solar radiation and consequently decrease the air temperature and the radiation temperature (Park et al., 2011; Dimoudi and Nikolopoulou, 2003; Hwang et al., 2010). Providing shade is one of the most important ways to enhance thermal comfort and increase health for citizens. In contrast, the blood Ô¨Çow rate during the winter season was below 10 TPU due to the extreme outdoor air temperature, which was sustained below 3 C. This low blood Ô¨Çow rate could not be increased even by wearing heavy clothes. A cold body with low blood perfusion should be warmed indoors. Public ofÔ¨Åce buildings, caf√©s or restaurants could serve as shelters in which pedestrians can increase their blood Ô¨Çow rate.  5.  Conclusions  The blood Ô¨Çow rate in the Ô¨Ångertip was measured during several seasons and analysed to elucidate the inÔ¨Çuence of indoor and outdoor air temperatures. The measurements yielded the following conclusions.  (1)  In a comfortable and healthy environment, the average blood Ô¨Çow rate is approximately 30 TPU, and the blood Ô¨Çow pattern is not constant but Ô¨Çuctuates between 15 TPU and 40 TPU. (2) The clothing insulation value was strongly correlated with the outdoor air temperature and ranged from 0.26 to 1.74 during the studied seasons (p < 0.01). Changing one‚Äôs clothing style is one of the most powerful adaption behaviours. temperature was below 3  C, warm (3) When the outside air indoor air could increase the blood Ô¨Çow rate from 6.74 TPU to 13.95 TPU (p < 0.05). The operation of a heating system is important in increasing microcirculation. (4) A low blood Ô¨Çow rate below 10 TPU was observed indoors during all seasons. Working while sedentary for a long time indoors could reduce the level of angiogenesis, which can lead to many disorders and diseases. Exposure to a mild climate outdoors with light exercise is recommended to improve human health. (5) During the summer, the increased blood Ô¨Çow observed outdoors was decreased signiÔ¨Åcantly indoors from 45.95 TPU to 36.14 TPU (p < 0.05). The building‚Äôs air conditioning sys- tem mitigated the extremely high blood Ô¨Çow rate, and harmful angiogenesis maybe inhibited indoors.

These conditions are particularly important in commercial, educational and healthcare buildings, where good Indoor Environmental Quality (IEQ) inÔ¨Çuences pro- ductivity, learning and convalescence (Frontczak and Wargocki, 2011). This study focuses on Italian children (9e11-years-old) and their school, where they usually spend about 8 h a day, i.e. one third of their daytime. Children are very sensitive to indoor conditions since they are at growing age and they may develop hypersensi- tivity if they are exposed to poor indoor conditions (Mendell and Heath, 2005). Bak√≥-Bir√≥ et al. (2012) investigate the inÔ¨Çuence of poor air quality on pupils‚Äô attention and vigilance, and results reveal that poor ventilation lowers memory and concentration. Many Italian schools have structural problems, such as insufÔ¨Å- cient space, safety, poor indoor air quality, low thermal comfort, and bad acoustics; they are often energy inefÔ¨Åcient due to obsolete systems, the facades are poorly, if at all insulated, and in some cases windows are single-glazed. Many studies have evaluated the indoor conditions of educa- tional buildings, taking into account single aspects (Mendell and  * Corresponding author. E-mail address: valeriadegiuli@gmail.com (V. De Giuli).  Heath, 2005; Bak√≥-Bir√≥ et al., 2012; Corgnati et al., 2009; Humphreys, 1977), or various aspects of overall comfort percep- tion (De Giuli et al., 2012a; AstolÔ¨Å et al., 2003; AstolÔ¨Å and Pellerey, 2008; Mumovic, 2009; d‚ÄôAmbrosio et al., 2010). This study looks at a range of aspects. Four different classrooms and a total of 62 students were involved in this research. The school is attended by pupils from different countries and many of them belong to families with economic difÔ¨Åculties; therefore the sample represents a range of cultures, habits and social classes, which may inÔ¨Çuence perception of comfort and expectations. Some studies have analyzed the role of ethnicity, socioeconomic status, teacher quality and school size in learning achievements (Nichols, 2003; Toutkoushian and Curtis, 2005). One study surveyed New York City public schools in order to clarify the role that the condition of school facilities plays in educational outcomes (Duran-Narucki, 2008), starting from the fact that poor living conditions are related to a higher risk of social and emotional difÔ¨Åculties (Evans and English, 2002). The IEQ analysis presented here is a development of the methodology explained and applied in (De Giuli et al., 2012a), where environmental snapshots were taken in seven primary schools near Venice; spot measurements were taken and pupils Ô¨Ålled in a survey about their general satisfaction with indoor con- ditions. In that study, no speciÔ¨Åc reference was made to actual conditions, except for thermal sensation; moreover, spot mea- surements were recorded only once and no continuous  0003-6870/$ e see front matter √ì 2014 Elsevier Ltd and The Ergonomics Society.

The present analysis, however, overcomes these limits with a speciÔ¨Åc ‚Äúspot survey‚Äù designed to compare recorded parameters with actual personal feelings; long- term measurements were also taken.  2.  Case study  In this study, indoor microclimatic conditions and the level of children‚Äôs satisfaction have been investigated in an educational building, by means of a comprehensive methodology, which in- volves both an objective and a subjective approach, measurements and survey administration, respectively. The school itself is in a residential area near the centre of Padova (Fig. 1(a)). In Italy, children begin primary school when they are six and they Ô¨Ånish when they are eleven. School starts in mid- September and ends in early June. This research studied four of the school‚Äôs classrooms: two were west-facing (A, B) and two east- facing (C, D). These classrooms were used by two fourth-year classes and two Ô¨Åfth-year classes, the oldest years at the school. The research lasted three months, from March to June, therefore it covered one month in heating conditions (until April 16) and two months in free-running conditions. The four classrooms are the same size (around 45 m2); their fa√ßade is singled-glazed, shaded with internal Venetian blinds (Fig. 2), and the blackboard is opposite the windows. Classrooms B and C have two facades, but classrooms A and D only one. All of the classrooms are heated by radiators, and lit by four Ô¨Çuorescent lamps; they have no cooling or mechanical ventilation systems. Pupils used two classrooms during the monitoring period: the fourth-year classes moved between classrooms A and B, while the Ô¨Åfth-year classes moved between classrooms C and D (Fig. 1(a) and (b)). The aim of this study is to Ô¨Ånd a possible correlation between the recorded values and children perception of indoor conditions. As regards thermal comfort, Fanger‚Äôs indexes PMV and PPD (Fanger, 1982; EN ISO 7730: 2005) have been calculated and compared to children actual thermal sensation, to see if Fanger‚Äôs approach could be suitable even for children. Moreover, the inÔ¨Çuence of children‚Äô position inside the classroom in terms in thermal comfort has been investigated, to see if the ones seated along the external and glazed wall express a different comfort level with respect to the ones seated far from the windows. Finally, from the answers given in the survey, an innovative statistical approach has been applied to provide a global ranking of the four classrooms, considering together thermal comfort, air quality and visual comfort: this ranking has been compared to the relative recorded parameters, to look for a possible correspondence between subjective and objec- tive evaluation. Considering classrooms‚Äô orientation and position inside the building, it could be expected that, as regards thermal aspect, classroom B should result the worst comfortable (North- West oriented and two external fa√ßades).  3.

s0003687014000064,"  The musculoskeletal system is often either permanently loaded, as in obese people, or occasionally loaded as in walkers that wear weighted backpacks (backpackers). In both cases (labeled as loaded populations), alterations in the biomechanical parameters of gait, such as in plantar pressure distribution (Castro et al., 2013; Castro et al., 2014; Hills et al., 2001) and ground reaction forces (GRF) (Birrell and Haslam, 2010; Birrell et al., 2007; Browning and Kram, 2007; Castro et al., 2013; Castro et al., 2014; Messier et al., 1996; Simpson et al., 2012) has been shown. Possibly, these biomechan- ical alterations may contribute to the higher incidence of low back pain (Grimmer and Williams, 2000; Skaggs et al., 2006), higher perceived exertion and shoulder discomfort (Simpson et al., 2011), second metatarsal stress fractures (Arndt et al., 2002), muscle strain  * Corresponding author.

Foot orthoses is a general term to describe a broad range of devices including heel lifts, lateral/medial wedges, or insoles (custom-made or prefabricated) (Chevalier and Chockalingam, 2012). These devices have been shown to be effective for man- aging many foot problems (Bonanno et al., 2011; Colagiuri et al., 1995; Cronkwright et al., 2011; Lynch et al., 1998; Sasaki and Yasuda, 1987). They can reduce and redistribute plantar foot pres- sure and subsequently avoid or decrease foot pain (Burns et al., 2007). However, the exact mechanisms by which foot orthoses work are yet to be fully understood (Chevalier and Chockalingam, 2012), and the biomechanical effect of these devices is far from the simplistic model often proposed in a clinical context (Nester et al., 2003); also, there is a need to establish the most suitable shoe/foot orthoses across clinical or high-risk populations (Rao et al., 2012).  0003-6870/$ e see front matter √ì 2014 Elsevier Ltd and The Ergonomics Society.

M. Peduzzi de Castro et al.  / Applied Ergonomics 45 (2014) 1028e1034  1029  The comprehension of how the forces are distributed on the foot along the stance phase seems to be essential to detecting over- loaded regions. The evaluation of the plantar pressures allows assessing the function of the ankle or foot while walking and other functional activities, as the foot and ankle are responsible for providing support and Ô¨Çexibility while weight transferring (Cavanagh and Ulbrecht, 1994). On the other hand, the plantar pressure systems do not provide any information regarding the shear forces. The analysis of the GRF provides global information about the vertical and shear stress forces during gait, whereas the plantar pressure analysis identiÔ¨Åes the distribution of the vertical GRF over the plantar foot surface. The combination of both analyses offer more detailed information about speciÔ¨Åc features of forces acting on the foot during gait (Castro et al., 2013). The knowledge of the different adaptations of the body when submitted to occasional or permanent load, and the development and testing of insoles developed speciÔ¨Åcally for these potential harmful situations may be helpful to further understand the mechanisms of foot orthoses to make physical exercise safe and to prevent injury. The primary aim of this study was to test the effects of two pressure relief insoles developed for loaded populations on GRF parameters and plantar pressure peaks during backpackers and obese‚Äô adults gait. The secondary aim was to compare the GRF and plantar pressures among normal-weight, backpackers and obese participants.  2. "
s0003687014000155,"  Limited space, standardized work routines, standardized cart size and inclined vibrating Ô¨Çoor present special physical challenges to cabin attendants working in commercial air travel (Lee et al., 2006, 2008). Low back pain (LBP) among such employees and an increased risk of sick leave related to LBP make it relevant to inves- tigate work-related factors that could contribute to the development of LBP (Elders et al., 2003; Wickstrom and Pentti, 1998). In general, it is established that pushing and pulling may generate compression and shear forces which may increase the risk of developing LBP. (Hoozemans et al., 2004, 2007; J√§ger and Luttmann, 1997; J√§ger et al., 2007; Knapik and Marras, 2009; Laursen and Schibye, 2002; Lee et al., 1991; Lett and McGill, 2006; Marras et al., 2009a,b; Norman et al., 1998; Schibye et al., 2001). Also, limits of tolerance have been suggested for compres- sion primarily based on epidemiological and biomechanical studies (Niosh, 1981; J√§ger and Luttmann, 1997) and for shear based on  * Corresponding author.

Even though earlier studies have stated that pushing and pulling activities are related to an increased risk of LBP (Hoozemans et al., 1998; Pope, 1989), more recent work (Hoozemans et al., 2002a,b) and a review by Roffey et al. (2010) have stated that push/pull ac- tivities in general are not a main risk factor in relation to LBP (Roffey et al., 2010). However, the special working conditions in the cabin and the expressed need for more studies in this area (Roffey et al., 2010) make it relevant to investigate low back loading during manual cart handling for this particular group that worldwide in- cludes an increasing number of people who operate under very similar working conditions. Factors such as handling type (pushing, pulling, turning), Ô¨Çoor inclination, Ô¨Çoor type and cart weight are expected to be related to the low back load (Al-Eisawi et al., 1999; Boocock et al., 2006; Jung et al., 2005; Laursen and Schibye, 2002), and it is important to evaluate which combinations of these factors are more likely to create the largest load on the lower back during work aboard the air craft in order to optimize future recommendations and interventions. Handling of commercial carts has been investigated in earlier studies (Glitsch et al., 2007; J√§ger et al., 2007; Schaub et al., 2007; Winkel, 1983). In the study by Winkel, female subjects were asked to accelerate the cart (push and pull) with the maximum  0003-6870/$ e see front matter √ì 2014 Elsevier Ltd and The Ergonomics Society.

This experiment caused the Swedish National Board of Occupational Safety and Health to reduce its recommended limit for repetitive push and pull in this task from 200 N to 100 N. The carts investi- gated were wide body carts weighting approximately 85 kg which where pushed and pulled on level carpet Ô¨Çoor. In 2007 a compre- hensive work was published on work factors, muscular capabilities and work load among German Ô¨Çight attendants during pushing and pulling of trolleys (Glitsch et al., 2007; J√§ger et al., 2007; Schaub et al., 2007). Some of the results from the project include hand forces, posture analyses and low back load during pushing and pulling with two different cart sizes each with three different masses and on four different Ô¨Çoor inclinations (48 actions). The main results regarding low back load showed an effect of Ô¨Çoor inclination (0e8 ) mainly during pushing and an effect of cart weight mainly at higher Ô¨Çoor inclinations. They also showed that pulling as in many other studies resulted in a higher low back load compared to pushing (Hoozemans et al., 2002b, 2004; Kumar, 1994; Laursen and Schibye, 2002; Lee et al., 1991; Lett and McGill, 2006; Marras et al., 2009a; Resnick and ChafÔ¨Ån, 1995; Schibye et al., 2001; Straker and Stevenson, 1997; van der Woude et al., 1995), however primarily with the half size cart. These data re- veals that adjustments in posture and action force occur depending on cart size, manoeuvre and Ô¨Çoor inclination. The present study aims to further investigate lumbar spine load during cart handling, focussing on the following aspects. First, the Ô¨Çoor type plays a role in relation to forces and low back loading during pushing and pulling because of differences in rolling friction (Al- Eisawi et al., 1999; Jansen et al., 2002; Laursen and Schibye, 2002; Marras et al., 2009b). In airplanes the Ô¨Çoor space in the centre aisle is usually carpeted, and we hypothesized that cabin attendants are subject to a higher low back load on this kind of surface compared with Ô¨Çoors with lower rolling friction (e.g. linoleum). Thus, recom- mendations to the industry to change the Ô¨Çooring to e.g. linoleum would depend not only on differences in friction between the two types of Ô¨Çooring but also on the attendant‚Äôs push/pull force in the initial phase. E.g. if the linoleum reduces rolling friction by 17 N compared to carpet, will we see a reduced push/pull force of about 17 N on linoleum or will the attendants maintain the same push/pull force as on carpet thereby creating a faster cart acceleration and in real life, gain seconds during a stressful working day? Secondly, in addition to pushing and pulling movements, turning movements are also included in the present study as this manoeuvre is often performed, especially in the galley where meal carts are prepared for servicing the passengers. But small turning actions also occur when attendants are pushing/pulling the cart in a straight line, as corrections of the movement direction in the narrow aisle also affect the body asymmetrically (Lee et al., 2012). Finally, low back muscle activity was recorded in order to measure the relative muscle activation during different cart manoeuvres. The estimation of low back load during cart acceleration will be used to identify working situations which present the highest strain on the worker. We pre- sent a number of recommendations for handling carts, both ergo- nomical and technical, that aim at reducing the risk of developing LBP.  2. "
s0003687014000167,"  Design Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (DFMEA) is an analytical methodology used in product development circles to ensure that potential problems have been considered and addressed. It was developed by reliability engineers in the 1950s to study problems stemming from malfunctions of military systems (Rausand and Hoylan, 2004). When DFMEA is used properly, it provides many beneÔ¨Åts. These include: [1] improved product/ process quality, reliability and safety, [2] reduced development time, [3] fewer late changes, [4] increased customer satisfaction, [5] shorter time to market, [6] early identiÔ¨Åcation and elimination of potential product failure modes, [7] improved validation process, [8] reduced warranty, [9] documented evidence of due care, and [10] improved company image and competitiveness (‚ÄúFMEA BeneÔ¨Åts‚Äù, 2013). A DFMEA is, in principle, a form of inductive reasoning. The intent is to supply strong evidence for (not absolute proof of) the truth of the conclusion. It stems from experience with similar products and/or usage conditions (i.e. examples that may include both successful and unsuccessful executions). Contrast this with deductive reasoning where a logically certain conclusion is reached from general statements. Ergonomists trained in the scientiÔ¨Åc method would recognize deduction as the approach through which  * Tel.: √æ1 313 805 4141.

The point, instead, is that hypotheses and theories are, often times, formulated using inductive reasoning. Automotive seat systems are products that are developed to deliver four primary functions. Listed in no particular order, they are [1] be aesthetically pleasing, [2] be safe, [3] be supportive, and [4] be comfortable. Most seat design and engineering efforts are concentrated on these functions. Product development geared toward delivering a good auto- motive driver seat is always a balance between these competing functions/demands. As one example, the safest head restraints are not necessarily the most comfortable. Franz et al. (2012) have realized this and are actively working to improve head restraint comfort. Eriksson (2005) describes how the incidence of whiplash associated disorders in rear-impact crashes can be decreased by positioning the head restraint closer to the head, in line with Fed- eral Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) 202a (NHTSA, 2004). Unfortunately, having introduced several new vehicles that comply with FMVSS 202a, vehicle manufacturers are reporting an increased number of complaints from consumers regarding head restraint closeness (Kolich, 2010). As another example, highlighted by Kamp (2012), aesthetics compete with comfort in that highly contoured (i.e. stylish) seats may not always be the most accom- modating (e.g. sport car seats do not always Ô¨Åt everyone). Further complicating matters is the lack of consensus concern- ing an operational deÔ¨Ånition of automotive seating comfort. The task of creating a universally accepted operational deÔ¨Ånition is  0003-6870/$ e see front matter √ì 2014 Elsevier Ltd and The Ergonomics Society.

1088  M. Kolich / Applied Ergonomics 45 (2014) 1087e1096  complex. Consider, for example, the fact that there is little agree- ment as to whether comfort and discomfort should be regarded as being a bipolar continuum or as composing two experiential di- mensions. Branton (1969) assumed that an automobile seat is un- likely to impart a positive feeling to the sitter. That is, the best a seat can do is to cause no discomfort. From the same perspective, Hertzberg (1972) deÔ¨Åned comfort as ‚Äòthe absence of discomfort‚Äô. Many of today‚Äôs researchers have adopted this deÔ¨Ånition because, in the current environment, it is more straightforward to quantify discomfort than to measure comfort. Other researchers argue that seat comfort is a bipolar dimension that can be attributed to characteristics of design (Richards, 1980). Evidence to support this claim comes from the fact that occupants, when given the oppor- tunity, rate their subjective responses across an entire continuum, ranging from positive comfort to discomfort. This is the school of thought subscribed to by researchers involved in designing comfort enhancing products (e.g. massaging seats). Zhang et al. (1996) believe that discomfort and comfort are based on independent factors. Feelings of discomfort are associated with pain, tiredness, soreness, and numbness. Comfort, on the other hand, was based on feelings of well-being and the aesthetic impression of the seat. A reduction of discomfort does not neces- sarily bring about feelings of comfort. There is no connection be- tween the two entities. Shen and Vertiz (1997) have proposed that comfort and discomfort coexist as separate dimensions, with the possibilities for comfort increasing when discomfort decreases. They describe comfort as the result of a continuous behavioural process of decreasing discomfort. For example, a wider, more supportive seat may provide better comfort than a narrower seat, even though the narrower seat does not produce a different level of discomfort. SpeciÔ¨Åc to automotive seating and in support of his own research activity, Kolich (2008) deÔ¨Ånes comfort as a consensually held construct [i.e. a large group of representative people (aligned to the target customer/market in terms of demographics, anthro- pometry, and values) perceive the seat in a similar manner] pos- sessing a static and dynamic component that can be manifested objectively (i.e. is consistently quantiÔ¨Åable). This deÔ¨Ånition was used to guide the remainder of the present work. Relative to those responsible for seating comfort development (typically, but not exclusively, ergonomists), there appears to be a lack of emphasis on traditional engineering disciplines and the related analysis techniques that are foundations to product devel- opment. They have, historically, been substituted by elaborate subjective evaluation methods (executed in the form of clinics), which are applied at speciÔ¨Åc points in the development process. It is common, in seating comfort development, to conduct clinics that coincide with program milestones. An example of these milestones is provided in Fig. 1.

The most common embodiment involves highly structured question- naires that direct occupants to assign feelings of discomfort to speciÔ¨Åc regions of the seat. The questionnaires, which typically contain numeric scales (e.g. 1 ¬º very uncomfortable to 10 ¬º very comfortable), yield subjective ratings that are translated, at the competitive benchmarking milestone (Phase I of Fig. 1), from a target seat to a program-speciÔ¨Åc performance requirement/speci- Ô¨Åcation. At all subsequent milestones (from concept demonstration to validation e i.e. Phases II to VI of Fig. 1), seats are built and evaluated using the same subjective evaluation approach. More speciÔ¨Åcally, the target seat is evaluated against the next generation seat until the new program seat meets or exceeds the comfort level offered by the target seat. The purported strength of this process lies in the A to B comparison of seats. A successful program (one that matches the performance of a target seat), since it takes approximately three years to execute, will be just as comfortable as the best seat in the market three years ago. This is, clearly, a problem. There are other noteworthy limitations associated with the clinic process. For one, there is no research to suggest an appro- priate ride & drive duration (i.e. how long does the evaluator need to sit in the seat to provide a meaningful assessment?). This is an important consideration because it impacts the number of pro- totypes needed and the number of evaluators (per day) that can reasonably be expected to participate; all of which affect cost, time, and data sufÔ¨Åciency from a statistical power perspective (i.e. con- Ô¨Ådence in the design recommendations). The interested reader is referred to Kolich (2008) for a more detailed discussion of the limitations. The limitations produce an overly iterative development pro- cess. Prototypes are designed, built, evaluated with target cus- tomers, re-designed, re-built, re-evaluated with target customers, etc. in what can, for some ergonomists, seem like a never-ending loop. Even if the process could consistently deliver a comfortable seat (unfortunately, this is not the case), the tumultuous state of the global economy and the associated strain being placed on vehicle manufacturers has made this type of iteration untenable. Since

Kolich / Applied Ergonomics 45 (2014) 1087e1096  1089  good seats (i.e. seats that the customers and, therefore, vehicle manufacturers are satisÔ¨Åed with) are an exception and not the rule, it must be concluded that the current seating comfort development process is, at least, somewhat ubiquitous and in need of overhaul. To improve the process, the industry has, moved toward aug- menting the subjective clinics with various types of objective in- dicators. Inherent in this are two assumptions. The Ô¨Årst is that the objective indicators have been correlated to subjective impressions. The second is that the objective indicators are more reliable and easy to apply. Seat contour, for example, is amendable to characterization that is more ‚Äúobjective‚Äù in nature. Fig. 2 shows how the complex shapes associated with seating surfaces can be reduced to speciÔ¨Åc sections. It is possible to dimension each section and establish target values. What Fig. 2 does not demonstrate is the important relationship between the seat surface and H-Point (SAE J826, 1995). The H-Point represents the manikin‚Äôs most important reference point; a joint intended to represent the pivot between the thighs and torso of a vehicle occupant. With the manikin installed in a vehicle seat, the location of the H-Point and the torso and thigh angles are key measures of the vehicle interior geometry. These measures are related to support, which, as described, is one of the four primary functions of a seat, and are audited during assembly operations. Many industry design practices, standards, and regulations (including those related to safety) reference the H-Point (e.g. SAE J287, 2007; SAE J1100, 2002; SAE J1517, 1998). Initial softness, overall seat hardness, and hardness distribution can also be quantiÔ¨Åed. The methods are similar in that they all yield load vs. deÔ¨Çection curves of trimmed cushions, seatbacks, and head restraints. The principal purposes are, however, distinct. Each test uses a different sized indenter and load. The initial softness test is intended to replicate a customer touching the seat before sitting and as such the load is comparatively light and the indenter is small. The underlying notion is that hand feel is important to im- pressions of comfort. The overall hardness test is supposed to provide insight into the seated occupant‚Äôs perception of softness (highest load and largest indenter), whereas the hardness distri- bution test provides a means of determining the uniformity/con- sistency of feel. More detail concerning these methods can be obtained from Montmayeur et al. (2007) and the Society of Auto- motive Engineers of Japan (JASO B407-87, 1987). Fig. 3 displays a typical load deÔ¨Çection machine equipped with a rigid butt form (which is a type of indenter). Sample overall cushion hardness output is shown in Fig. 4. Target curves can be established, corre- lated to subjective ratings, and used to develop the program seat. Three other objective indicators that have been used in seat comfort evaluations are pressure distribution (Kolich, 2004), elec- tromyography (Ellgast et al., 2012), and occupied vibration trans- missibility (Gu, 1998). Mergl et al. (2005) have correlated the contact forces between people and automotive seats (pressure distribution) to subjective impressions of comfort. Zenk et al. (2012) investigated the concept of ‚Äúoptimal load distribution‚Äù based on the relationship between the pressure on the seat and the discomfort felt by the seated occupant. Hartung et al. (2004a, b) have done extensive investigations into human sensitivity to pressure in seated postures and the associated reliability of these types of measurements. Electromyography (EMG), as applied to seating, is taken as a measure of muscular load (usually of the back muscles). It has also been used to assess body posture and movement, in particular spinal postures. EMG has been used, among many other applica- tions, to compare and contrast the effects of different lumbar mechanisms integrated into automotive seats (Kolich et al., 2001). Transmissibility is especially interesting in that it has, for many years, been used as an indicator of ride quality. Transmissibility is  Fig. 3. Set-Up for overall cushion hardness test.  the non-dimensional ratio of the response amplitude of a seat system in steady state forced vibration to the excitation amplitude expressed as a function of the vibration frequency (GrifÔ¨Ån, 1990). The ratio may be one of forces, displacements, velocities, or accel- erations. The most direct method of measuring the transmissibility is to compare the acceleration on the seat surface with that at the base of the seat. To accomplish this, standard practice is to acquire signals provided by accelerometers mounted at the base of a seat (e.g. Ô¨Çoor attachment points) and at the interface between the seat surface and the human body. The transmissibility of a seat can be measured on any axis (e.g. vertical, lateral, or horizontal) or at any point (e.g. beneath the ischial tuberosities or between the human back and the seatback). Most of the available research involves only the vertical transmissibility from the seat base to the ischial tu- berosities, as this is thought to be the primary axis affecting ride quality (Kolich et al., 2004; Lee and Ferraiuolo, 1993; Fairley and GrifÔ¨Ån, 1986). More recently, the focus of the automotive industry, including seat engineering, has shifted toward simulating the aforemen- tioned objective tests and integrating digital human modelling (Paul et al., 2012a; Mergl et al., 2004). As an example, Paul et al. (2012b) showed that the interface between the human occupant  1000  )  N  (  e c  r  o F  900  800  700  600  500  400  300  200  100  0  0  5  10  15  20  25  30  35  40  45  50  Deflection (mm)  Fig. 4.

1090  M. Kolich / Applied Ergonomics 45 (2014) 1087e1096  and driver seat could be modelled in enough detail to determine the contribution of various seat components to hardness and pressure. Kim and Martin (2012) established an empirical database that could support a biodynamic model taking into consideration human activity to predict reaching performance under whole body vibration exposure. Marca et al. (2011) have recognized that, in order for this type of virtual work to signiÔ¨Åcantly reduce develop- ment cost and time, it is necessary to ‚Äúchain simulations‚Äù. That is, to expand beyond comfort-related attributes and into safety, dura- bility, and craftsmanship. With this as the back-drop, the objective of this paper is to demonstrate, via a working example, how and when a staple of engineering, namely Design Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (DFMEA), can be applied to the seating comfort development of a full-foam driver‚Äôs seat (i.e. a driver‚Äôs seat in which the trim and foam is placed on a ‚Äúdead pan‚Äù and rigidly mounted to the vehicle Ô¨Çoor pan; contrasted this with a seat system in which the trim and foam rests on top of a spring system of some type). The belief is that, by incorporating this systematic and widely applied/accepted analytical approach, ergonomists could decrease the excessive iteration that is part of the current development process (thereby reducing cost, time, and measurement error), minimize the likeli- hood of failure, and further the science of seating comfort.  2. Method  This section is, admittedly and purposely, not fashioned as a typical description of a methodology. Rather, it provides a step-by- step guide for how to apply DFMEA to the development of a comfortable full foam driver‚Äôs seat. The blank DFMEA template, shown in Fig. 5, is consistent with SAE J1739 (2009) and is the crux of this guide. The explanation of each step is augmented with a speciÔ¨Åc example. The intent is to provide some insight into the thought process and judgements involved in moving from the blank template (Fig. 5) to a populated DFMEA in Fig. 6 (i.e. con- structing this type of DFMEA). The Ô¨Årst step is to deÔ¨Åne the Function, which must be written in a measurable/veriÔ¨Åable format. A description of Function should answer the question: ‚ÄúWhat is this driver‚Äôs seat supposed to do?‚Äù Function is the design intent or engineering requirement of the driver‚Äôs seat being analysed. As previously stated, there are four primary functions of a driver‚Äôs seat. The DFMEA associated with this paper is focused on the Function, ‚ÄúBe comfortable‚Äù. This function should be entered into the Ô¨Årst column of the blank DFMEA tem- plate shown in Fig. 5.  For each identiÔ¨Åed Function, the ergonomist, together with his/ her team, must identify what can go wrong. In general, Failure Modes fall within one of the following categories: [1] no Function e seat not operational, [2] partial/over/degraded Function e not all of the function is operating, [3] intermittent Function e seat occa- sionally does not function, and [4] unintended Function e unex- pected function occurs due to seat system interactions. It is important to realize that all Failure Modes must be directly related to the Function. The potential Failure Modes should be entered into the second column of the blank DFMEA template (Fig. 5). With respect to the primary function of ‚Äúbe comfortable‚Äù, the potential Failure Modes are many and varied. They range from psychological issues (perceptions of appearance) to anthropo- metric issues (questions of Ô¨Åt) to biomechanical issues (postural) to physiological issues (tissue deformation and vibration induced disorders). The ergonomist and his/her team are urged to review internal clinic data and verbatims from past seating comfort development programs, as well as third party information from sources like J.D. Power and Consumer Reports, to arrive at a list of the most common Failure Modes. This information, particularly if it is gleaned from seats/vehicles targeted toward similar market segments/customers, represents a reasonable starting point for any seating comfort DFMEA. This was, in fact, done to arrive at the six potential Failure Modes recorded in Fig. 6. Having documented the Failure Modes, the ergonomist (and his/ her team) must now consider the Effects of each Failure Mode from the perspective of the seat system, the vehicle, the customer, and government regulations. The potential Effects of Failure should be entered into the third column of the blank DFMEA template (Fig. 5). Once the effects have been documented, they need to be evaluated for Severity. Severity is linked to the Effect of failure, and each Effect identiÔ¨Åed in the list must be assigned a Severity rating. Severity is a relative ranking within the scope of the individual DFMEA. Each Effect must be assigned a Severity rating using the Severity Rating Table (Table 1). For Severity values of 9 or 10, where safety and/or government regulations are affected, the ergonomist/team should enter YC (an abbreviation for ‚ÄúPotential Critical Failure Mode‚Äù) in the ClassiÔ¨Å- cation column of Fig. 5 and, if possible, eliminate the Failure Mode without analysing Cause. If not, the ergonomist/team should continue by following the process described in the remainder of this section. Note that, while all Effects are assigned a Severity Rating, only the highest value, for a particular Failure Mode, is entered in the Severity Column of the DFMEA template (Fig. 5).  .  N  .  P  .

In the classiÔ¨Åcation column of Fig. 5, the letters ‚ÄúYS‚Äù (which is an abbre- viation for ‚ÄúPotential SigniÔ¨Åcant Failure Mode‚Äù) should be entered. At this time, the seat manufacturing team should, if possible, start considering special plant inspections to catch ‚ÄúYS‚Äù related failures. The Cause/Mechanism of Failure represents the parameters that the ergonomist can manipulate to inÔ¨Çuence the Failure Mode. As an extension of the same ‚ÄúÔ¨Åt‚Äù example from Fig. 6, it is clear that there are two potential Causes. The Ô¨Årst is speciÔ¨Åc to the size of the seat (i.e. too small/narrow). The second is related to the interior occu- pant package as indicated by various SAE J1100 (2002) dimensions for head, knee, hip, and shoulder room. In terms of Occurrence, the seat size is a less likely Cause of this Failure Mode than is the occupant package/roominess. Estimates, based on Table 2, are 2 per thousand seats (rating ¬º 5) and ten per thousand seats (rating ¬º 7), respectively. In both instances, because the Failure Mode/Cause combination has a Criticality rating of greater than or equal to 32 (i.e. Severity of 8 and Occurrence rating greater than or equal to 4), a potentially signiÔ¨Åcant failure mode (‚ÄúYS‚Äù) was entered into the ClassiÔ¨Åcation column of the DFMEA in Fig. 6. It is the job of the ergonomist and his/her team to address all Causes by recommending design actions that will either eliminate the Cause or lower its occurrence. This gets into the Current Design Control column of the DFMEA template in Fig. 5. There are two varieties of Design Controls/features to consider. The Ô¨Årst is ‚Äúpre- vention‚Äù. The motivation here is to prevent (before a seat is actually built) the Cause/Mechanism or Failure Mode/Effect from occurring or to reduce the rate of Occurrence. These are design actions that can be ascertained from pre-existing Component-Level Design Guidelines or Internal Product Letters that specify the seat features and adjustability needed to satisfy the target customer‚Äôs comfort needs. The second variety of Design Control is ‚Äúdetection‚Äù. Based on physical tests, like those described in the  section of this paper, the aim is to detect the Cause/Mechanism of the Failure Mode after the seat is prototyped but before the design is released for production tooling (Phase VI of Fig. 1). Detection rating is the ergonomist‚Äôs/team‚Äôs assessment of the Design Control‚Äôs ability to identify Cause and/or Failure Mode. Detection, much like Severity, is a relative ranking within the scope of the individual DFMEA. Detection ratings (and the associated values to enter into the DFMEA template) are given in Table 3. The engineer/ergonomist then proceeds to compute the Risk Priority Number (R.P.N.), which equals Severity times Occurrence times Detection (S  O  D). There is only one R.P.N. for each Cause. Continuing on with the ‚ÄúÔ¨Åt‚Äù Failure Mode, the Current Design Controls are Component-Level Design Guidelines for seat width and occupant package/roominess. Both sets of design guidelines could be market-segment speciÔ¨Åc. Fortunately, the likelihood of High‚Äù for seat width guidelines (Detection rating ¬º 2) to ‚ÄúModer- Detection by these Current Design Controls ranges from ‚ÄúVery ately High‚Äù for roominess guidelines (Detection rating ¬º 4).

No discernible effect.  9  8 7  6  5  4  3  2  1  The Effect of a seating comfort failure is, in this DFMEA, always related to a decrement that negatively affects customer satisfaction. To illustrate the point, consider the Ô¨Årst row of the DFMEA in Fig. 6. The Failure Mode is ‚Äúcustomer cannot physically Ô¨Åt into the seat/ vehicle‚Äù. This is more likely in a sub-compact car than a van. If the customer cannot Ô¨Åt, he/she, obviously, cannot experience the seating comfort. As a result, he/she will not buy the vehicle. This is the Effect of the failure. Since this does not affect safety and/or a government regulation, the Severity rating is deÔ¨Ånitely not a 9 or 10. If the customer cannot Ô¨Åt into the seat/vehicle, the seat can, however, be considered inoperable. This satisÔ¨Åes the criteria for a Severity rating of 8 (Table 1). The next step is to address the basic or underlying Cause that results in the Failure Mode. Potential Cause of failure is deÔ¨Åned as the reason for the primary non-conformance and is the item that requires change to achieve permanent preventive/corrective action. It is an indication of a design weakness, the consequence of which is the Failure Mode. Said another way, Causes address Failure Modes, not Effects. Causes should be written as a design weakness that should be corrected. They are best described in terms of part characteristics, such as dimension, size, form, location, orientation, texture, hardness, tensile strength, appearance, coating, reÔ¨Çectivity, etc. When brainstorming potential Causes of each failure, the ergonomist and his/her team should begin with the following as- sumptions: [1] the seat is manufactured and assembled within engineering speciÔ¨Åcations and [2] the seat design may include a deÔ¨Åciency that may cause unacceptable variation, (e.g., misbuilds or errors in the manufacturing and assembly process). After all the Causes of the Failure Modes have been identiÔ¨Åed and entered into the DFMEA template (Fig. 5), the ergonomist/team must determine how often each Cause occurs on a scale of 1e10. Occurrence can be deÔ¨Åned as the likelihood that a speciÔ¨Åc Cause will occur during the design life (e.g., 150,000 miles or 10 years). Table 2 is used to estimate the failure rate for each Cause and determine the value that should be entered into the DFMEA tem- plate (Fig. 5). When a Failure Mode/Cause combination has a Severity rating of 5e8 and an Occurrence rating of 4 or higher (so that the product of Severity and Occurrence e also known as Criticality rating e is

The resulting R.P.N.‚Äôs are 80 and 224, respectively. The reader will note that 224 is the highest R.P.N. in the sample DFMEA (Fig. 6). For this reason, the associated Recommended Action, which calls for the creation of a Computer Aided Design (CAD) model to allow for early evaluation of the occupant package/roominess, would be prioritized over other ac- tions geared toward addressing Failure Modes with lower R.P.N.s. The purpose of recommending actions in a DFMEA (the last column of the DFMEA template in Fig. 5) is to eliminate potential Failure Modes or reduce their occurrence. The ergonomist/team should prioritize actions based on those Failure Modes with [1] Effects that have the highest Severity ratings, [2] Causes that have the highest Criticality ratings, and [3] the Highest R.P.N.s. Threshold values for R.P.N. should not be used. In practice, the responsibility for implementing the Recom- mended Actions would, probably, be spread between the ergono- mist/engineer (design guidelines and tests), the industrial designer (development of styling guidelines), the CAD engineers (for para- metric models and templates), and virtual engineering analysts (for creation and implementation of simulation tools).  3. Results  The stepwise process described above was followed for all Failure Modes outlined in Fig. 6. While only a sample DFMEA rep- resenting a relatively small subset of the potential Failure Modes associated with a speciÔ¨Åc automotive seating application (i.e. full foam driver seat), the reader should be struck by the assortment of different Effects, Causes, Current Design Controls, and Recom- mended Actions. This highlights the complexity associated with seating comfort development and explains, at least partly, why the current process is so iterative. Quantifying the inÔ¨Çuence of the Recommended Actions relative to the current Design Controls is an important output of the  DFMEA. The column titled Action Results‚Äù in Fig. 6 allows for this type of analysis. When summarized, as is done in Table 4, the data demonstrate that the average Criticality and R.P.N. were decreased from 22 and 87 to 12 and 31, respectively. Creating a ‚Äòcomponent level design rule‚Äô to address the ‚Äòhead restraint contacting the head/ hair in normal driving position‚Äô is the Recommended Action that stands to have the largest impact on the function ‚Äòbe comfortable‚Äô (i.e. a 115 point reduction in R.P.N.). The smallest impact (i.e. a 15 point reduction in R.P.N.) comes from the ‚Äòdevelopment of a para- metric CAD model‚Äô to deal with the seat ‚Äònot holding tight enough during cornering‚Äô. This does not imply that the Recommended Action is not effective. It does, however, suggest that the Failure Mode/Cause combinations have comparatively low Severity and Occurrence ratings (low Criticality Rating).  4. Discussion  This section is built largely on anecdotes derived from more than 15 years of experience in the automotive seating industry. It is intended to offer additional insight into how the presented DFMEA was used to uncover and then mitigate seating comfort design risks, with special emphasis on justifying the Recommended Ac- tions and supporting the signiÔ¨Åcant improvements (over the cur- rent iterative seating comfort development process) described in the preceding section. Also included in this section is a brief discourse concerning the limitations that the ergonomist should recognize before implementing this approach. Internal Product Letters and Component-Level Design Guide- lines, as Current Design Controls, are generally superior to Sub- jective Tests (ride & drives and other types of clinics) in terms of likelihood of Failure Mode detection (see Fig. 6). They are even superior to Objective Tests in that they move the industry away from requiring expensive prototype seats (and the ensuing seating comfort development iterations). Unfortunately, with the state of current knowledge/technology, there are Failure Modes for which a clinic cannot be avoided. Three examples, shown in Fig. 6, are: [1] ‚Äúseatbelt does not Ô¨Åt‚Äù, [2] ‚Äúhead restraint contacts head/hair in normal driving position‚Äù, and [3] ‚Äúseat is ugly, lacking style‚Äù. These happen to be the Failure Modes that produce among the highest R.P.N.s. Since it is impossible to address all design weaknesses at once, it is reasonable for the ergonomist and his/her team to focus their design activity on these Failure Modes. To elaborate, the ‚ÄúInternal Product Letter‚Äù, which comes from the marketing team, is important because it speciÔ¨Åes the features and adjustability needed to allow individual consumers, who have a broad range of preferences, to self-select settings that satisfy their personal seating comfort expectations. Seats that offer the most features and adjustability should, theoretically, accommodate the most customers. The cost implications cannot, however, be over- looked. While it is generally true that more is better when it comes to features and adjustability, in some segments, the customer may not have the means or the willingness to pay for added Ô¨Çexibility; choosing instead to live with/accept less comfort or accommoda- tion. The intent of the Internal Product Letter is to reduce the  Table 4 Estimated inÔ¨Çuence of recommended actions.  DFMEA metric  Average  Standard dev.

The Internal Product Letter is the only current Design Control shown in Fig. 6 that impacts the Severity rating. All other current Design Controls serve to decrease, to various extents, the Occur- rence ratings and the Detection ratings (and, thereby, the Criticality ratings and the R.P.N.s). The Internal Product Letter is also listed as one of the Current Design Controls for the ‚Äúhead restraint contacts head/hair in normal driving position‚Äù Failure Mode. The Recommended Action, in this case, is to conduct even more thorough customer research. The rationale is that one can never learn too much about customer needs, wants, values, etc. This is, admittedly, a challenge given the immense pressure today‚Äôs OEMs are under to reduce operating costs, which includes consumer research spending. If implemented, the expectation is that this action would decrease the Severity rating from 5 to 4 (the thought is that satisfaction should improve because the adjustability of the head restraint was matched to the needs of the target customer), the Occurrence rating from 8 to 7 (a reduction of 10 failures per thousand seats), and the Detection rating from 4 to 3 (Fig. 6). This amounts to a 76 point improvement in the R.P.N. ‚ÄúComponent-Level Design Guidelines‚Äù, in contrast to the ‚ÄúIn- ternal Product Letter‚Äù, are usually documented in lists that are ar- ranged according to speciÔ¨Åc commodities within the seat (e.g. trim cover, foam, adjustment mechanisms, structure, etc.), as well as occupant package parameters. The most effective and readily accepted guidelines are based on a speciÔ¨Åc case study, example, or lesson learnt (another form of inductive reasoning). Stakeholders like to know that their seat design is not doomed to replicate the cause of a Failure Mode encountered by a previous program. Many of the Recommended Actions, highlighted in Fig. 6, extend and further systematize the ‚ÄúComponent-Level Design Guidelines‚Äù by creating Computer Aided Design (CAD) templates or occupant ac- commodation models, which could be introduced very early in the seating comfort development process. Instead of having the in- dustrial designer release a seat surface model to the ergonomist for a design guideline check after having spent multiple days creating the shapes and developing an afÔ¨Ånity for his/her concept, the in- dustrial designer could be provided with CAD templates to guide the design in real-time. In this way, the industrial designer would immediately realize when his/her concept is in violation of a design guideline and likely to cause a Failure Mode. In the context of ‚ÄúComponent-Level Design Guidelines‚Äù, the Cause for which CAD templates would have the largest impact is ‚Äúseat cushion is too narrow‚Äù. The expectation is that, in this instance, the implementation and institutionalization of CAD templates would decrease the Occurrence rating from 5 to 3 (1.5 failures per thousand seats) and the Detection rating from 2 to 1 (Fig. 6). In the end, this equates to a 56 point R.P.N. improvement. Aimed speciÔ¨Åcally at improving the current iterative develop- ment process, there are two more noteworthy Recommended Ac- tions shown in Fig. 6. The Ô¨Årst is Seat Styling Guidelines. They are intended to address the ‚Äúseat is ugly, lacking style‚Äù Failure Mode. These guidelines are estimated to have the largest impact on Occurrence rating. More speciÔ¨Åcally, seat styling guidelines would be expected to decrease the Occurrence rating from 8 (20 per thousand seats) to 6 (5 per thousand seats). A rating of six qualiÔ¨Åes as a ""Moderate: Occasional failure"". While the aesthetic of the seat are known to inÔ¨Çuence comfort (Kamp, 2012; Branton, 1969), it would be difÔ¨Åcult to decrease the Occurrence rating further given the highly subjective nature of this construct. The second is the creation of an Objective Test to address the ""seatbelt does not Ô¨Åt"" Failure Mode. This Recommended Action is expected to improve the Detection rating from Low (rating of 6) to High (rating of 3). This  in the DFMEA  corresponds to the largest Detection improvement (Fig. 6). DFMEAs are primarily concerned with problem prevention. They are aimed at reducing dissatisfaction for all customers and stakeholders. As such, they are best done early in the development process (i.e. when the seat design has not yet reached Ô¨Ånal deÔ¨Å- nition). The earlier the DFMEA is performed, the more cost effective will be the actions taken. Referring back to Fig. 1, a DFMEA can be used to support, if not supplant, the physical assessments done during Phase II, III, and IV. A signiÔ¨Åcant beneÔ¨Åt of the DFMEA is that it documents knowledge and systematizes the design process for use on future seating comfort development programs. This is especially true for those OEMs that are aiming to reuse components to manage costs (e.g. seat structures) while producing a speciÔ¨Åc seat feel (one that is consistent with a brand promise; sometimes referred to as DNA) across vehicles. The ergonomist inspired to implement DFMEA in this way will likely be challenged. Questions will come from outside sources (Can comfort be deÔ¨Åned/quantiÔ¨Åed? Is the DFMEA detailed/complete enough to be useful? Is there enough evidence to support the Severity, Occurrence, and Detection ratings?) and from within (Is the approach ‚ÄúscientiÔ¨Åc‚Äù enough? Does it align with classical/ traditional ergonomic training?). One can argue whether comfort can be measured and, therefore, veriÔ¨Åed. This is a prerequisite for the deÔ¨Ånition of Function, which is the Ô¨Årst step in the creation of a DFMEA (Is ‚Äúbe comfortable‚Äù an appropriate primary function?). This debate could, very easily, serve as the subject of a separate dissertation. That said, the in- dustry has evolved under the assumption that seating comfort is consistently quantiÔ¨Åable (hence Kolich‚Äôs 2008 deÔ¨Ånition); that consumers distinguish between vehicles and make purchase de- cisions based partly on this attribute. OEMs have put together elaborate evaluation protocols to quantify the subjective perception of seating comfort. They have gone so far as to attempt to predict, using various statistical techniques, subjective ratings that are published by various third party organizations (e.g. J.D. Power, Consumer Reports, etc.). The ergonomist will wrestle with how much detail to include in the DFMEA. That is, how to deÔ¨Åne the boundaries. The decision to focus this DFMEA on the seating comfort development of a full foam driver‚Äôs seat was based on simplicity of demonstration. A full foam driver‚Äôs seat, versus a seat with a sprung suspension system, offers one less variable to manipulate. While this can limit the er- gonomists tuning capability, it does serve to eliminate a potential Cause(s)/Mechanism(s) of Failure. Consider, for example, the following Failure Mode from Fig. 6: ""customer sinks into the seat too much"". In addition to the foam being too soft and thick, this Failure Mode could stem from the springs being overly compliant. Beyond this example, some may question whether the sample DFMEA would apply to a passenger or rear seat. Others may view the lack of reference to thermal/climate comfort aspects as a glaring omission. For insight into contemporary approaches in this area, the interested reader is referred to Oi et al. (2012). Internal to the ergonomist, an automotive seat that accommo- dates the conventional 5th to 95th percentile anthropometry might be viewed as a success. This would, in the context of DFMEA, pro- duce between 50 and 100 comfort related complaints per thousand customers. According to Table 2, this occurrence rate would be categorized as a very high probability of failure (i.e. persistent failure). The accommodation question is complicated by the fact that not all anthropometrically accommodated customers will be satisÔ¨Åed; just as not all anthropometrically dis-accommodated customers will complain (Kolich, 2003). Anthropometric accom- modation is just one element of seating comfort development. This philosophical disconnect may, at least partly, explain why DFMEA,  
M. Kolich / Applied Ergonomics 45 (2014) 1087e1096  1095  as an analytical tool for product development, has not traditionally been employed by ergonomists charged with seating comfort development. The ergonomics of seating, obviously, extends beyond automo- tive applications. Noro et al. (2012), for example, have studied how to design microscopic surgery seating to better conform to the users‚Äô needs. OfÔ¨Åce (Groenesteijn et al., 2012) and aircraft (Vink et al., 2012) seating remain active and worthwhile areas of explo- ration. The hope is that this paper has stimulated researchers in these areas to adopt/experiment with the DFMEA approach.  5.  Conclusion  Automotive seat comfort, which is, often times, practiced by individuals with a background in ergonomics, has developed as an applied science. Traditional research in this area has been moti- vated by a practical concern for the health and well-being of the customer and the view that comfort is a product differentiator in the eyes of the end customer. However, the discipline has a ten- dency to be reactive to current needs, rather than proactive. Convention, among ergonomists, is to attempt to design comfort- able automotive seats using a trial and error approach, which renders the discipline difÔ¨Åcult to practice. Using empiricism and intuition is not, in and of itself, problematic. The issue, instead, is that the design process is not systematized. Every seat program is a brand new endeavour; even though automobiles have included seats since their inception. From this perspective, this paper demonstrated that a widely applied and accepted engineering analysis technique, namely DFMEA, could have a valuable role to play in seating comfort development (speciÔ¨Åcally) and ergonomics (generally) by supplying strong evidence for the advantages of particular design alternatives. DFMEA also offers a mechanism through which groups of ideas/principles could be integrating into testable hypotheses and theories. The quest to prove or disprove the theories could then drive research agendas at automotive companies and their partners. Theory is understood to be an essential underpinning of any discipline that aspires to be perceived as a true science, including the burgeoning science of automotive seat comfort.

s0003687014000180,"  1.1. Evolution of mini-notebooks (netbooks)/ultraportables as small form-factor Mobile PCs  1.1.1. Multi-device continuity and varied sizes of Mobile PCs  As advances in Internet, wireless communication, and touch- control technologies, Eee PC launched in 2007 and iPad launched in 2010 have triggered mini-notebook (netbooks) and tablet mar- ket, respectively. Since then, many computer vendors had been offering netbooks and tablets which are two categories of so-called ‚ÄúMobile PCs‚Äù. Actually netbooks fall into a category of what vendors refer to as ‚Äúsmall form-factor‚Äù notebooks. Small form-factor note- books have been known by various names, including subnotebook (ultra-portable, mini-notebook/netbook, ultrabook and mini ultraportable/ultrabook), CloudBook, and ultra-mobile PC (UMPC). There is no clear boundary between each other. Similarly, both powerful tablets (with super portability and enhanced productiv- ity) and tablet-ultraportables (combining the ultraportable features of tablets with the productivity of detachable/dockable-hybrid or sliding/rotating-convertible keyboards, and the Ô¨Çexibility to switch between form factors) blurred the boundary between tablet and laptops. In this scenario, to compete with increased tablet adoption and the shift to touch notebooks and ultra-slim devices with lower-priced solutions, netbooks had been evolved to be ‚Äútablet-  * Corresponding author.

E-mail addresses:  netbooks/ultraportables‚Äù with hybrid or convertible modes of tablets and netbooks; likewise, some small form-factor laptops, so- called ‚Äúslim-type laptops‚Äù (ultraportables, ultrabooks, or mini ultraportables/ultrabooks with less than 1400 diagonal screens) have been transformed to be ‚Äúultrabooks/ultraportables- tablets‚Äù. These phenomena were especially widespread in the second half of 2013 with newly marketed processors aimed to bring more tablet PC-like features (e.g., instance on, all-day battery life, and sleek form fac- tors) to notebook PCs. The tablet-netbooks/ultraportables and ‚Äúultrabooks/ultraportables- tablets‚Äù eventually converges to be convertible/hybrid ‚Äútablet PCs‚Äù as one category (except the ones remained as so-called convertible/hybrid or 2-in-1 ultraportables/ ultra-slim PCs, e.g. Ultrabook 2 in 1). Thus, it seems that the PC brands have been increasing the number of tablet PC models (including convertibles/hybrids) in their product mixes. According to the data of ‚ÄúComparison of tablet computers‚Äù and ‚ÄúList of Windows 8 and RT tablet devices‚Äù (Wikipedia Contributors, 2013a, 2013b) and cross-checking with the brands‚Äô product listings (deducted the overlapping with convertible/detachable Ultrabooks or mini-Ultrabooks) on websites, around 4%, 21%, 13%, 43%, and 19% computers with 500 models in the market were the tablet (and smaller), 700e7.200 , 7.700e9.400 , 9.700e10.800 , 11.600 (and larger) diagonal screens, respectively. The new form factors of convertibles and hybrids contributed 34% (55 in 161) models to the tablet PC market the 7.700e8.300 (2009e2013), including merely 9% (1 in 11) screen models but around 42% (26 in 62) the 10.100e10.800 ones (convertible vs hybrid vs slate ¬º 10%:32%:58%), 71% (10 in 14) the 11.600 ones (convertible vs hybrid vs slate ¬º 29%:42%:29%), and 77% (10 in 13)  0003-6870/$ e see front matter √ì 2014 Elsevier Ltd and The Ergonomics Society.

Among the total tablet market, 62% (46 in 161) table computers were the 10.100e12.500 screen models of which 52% (46 in 89) were convertibles/hybrids. Similarly, based on the release of Windows 8 (and latest version Windows 8.1), some ultraportables/ mini-ultrabooks have also been evolved to expand the convertible/ hybrid form factors of ultrabooks and tablets with 11.600e15.600 di- agonal touchscreens. (Wikipedia Contributors, 2013c) From these market data mentioned above, it was obvious that mini-notebooks/ netbooks with 10.100e12.500 diagonal screens and ultraportables/ 11.600e15.600 mini-ultrabooks with diagonal screens have been evolved with device convergence and responding by adopting the features of both tablets and notebooks that users most appreciated.  1.1.2. Applied tasks, limitation of form factors, and prices of mini- notebooks (netbooks)/ultraportables  With the optimal-sized displays and dedicated keyboards, ‚Äútablet-subnotebook/netbooks‚Äù and ‚Äúultraportable-tablets‚Äù allowed sufÔ¨Åcient performances to fulÔ¨Åll the needs of a majority of PC users, such as web browsing, e-mailing, social networking, photo sharing, and other Internet-centric activities, as well as word processing and spreadsheet works. According to a recent CEA research study (Consumer Electronics Association, 2013), in U.S. household that 92% and 83% tablet users utilize their tablets to browse the Web and check e-mails, respectively. In addition, tablets are used for more leisurely activities such as playing games (78%), watching videos (66%), and reading e-books (61%). While 46% of them reducing the time spent on laptops, 98% tablet owners have not stopped using laptop. As a result, consumers are gravitating toward connected mobile devices able to perform multiple func- tions in efÔ¨Åcient form factors like laptops or convertible/hybrid tablet PCs with productive keyboards. To fulÔ¨Åll users‚Äô needs of convenience and efÔ¨Åciency in the growing but fast changing mobile PC market, there is no one-size- Ô¨Åt-all device solution but adoption of appropriate form-factor de- vice to speciÔ¨Åc task types. In fact, no matter how form factor (including size, shape, and layout) shifts, it simultaneously impacts mobility and productivity. Still, there were two major limitations with small form factors (including subnotebooks, mini-notebooks/ netbooks, ultraportables, or their convertible/hybrid tablet modes) e limited viewing area on the screen and inability to type fast without constantly hitting the wrong keys. Consequently, for instance, some 1200 tablet-mini-notebooks/netbooks (convertibles) with larger screens and keyboards had been emerged to solve the limitations, while they were almost full-sized laptops which removed certain portability. However, no matter what type of task is applied, the size effect impacts productivity, portability and user‚Äôs experience of device usage on any form factors of mobile devices. Thus, for the sake of simplicity, with a range of small form factors in size (from 700 to 11.600 screen diagonal), light weight, and complete with multiple input options (touchscreen, touchpad, and keyboard), netbooks (with touchscreens) were suitable to test and compare on varied application tasks if and how the size effects of displays and/or in-put devices impact the usability of ultra- portables/mini-notebooks. In terms of focusing on size effects, this study investigated and compared four mini-notebooks (net- books) with 700, 8.900 , 10.100, and 11.600 diagonal touchscreens which might provide valuable information to small form factors of convertible/hybrid tablet PCs/ultraportables, ultra-slim PCs, or similar mobile/portable computing devices. In addition to the form factors in sizes, given the demands in price-sensitive markets, the average selling prices might also affect the acceptance of products. Generally, most of mini-notebooks (netbooks) were less expensive and lighter than traditional laptop PC‚Äôs. For example, the standard netbooks‚Äô prices (around US$200e  450 in the US market) and typical weights (around 2e3.2 lbs.) were dependent on sizes and features, while many mini-notebooks (netbooks) with expanded features increased costs and weights. On the contrary, the prices of ultra-slim PCs (or ultraportables) have gradually decreased due to maturing panel production process. Recently a generation of low-voltage ultraportables appeared with prices under $600. By the end of 2013, a new generation of Win- dows tablets (or tablet-ultraportables hybrids) will be launched in a variety of price points, sizes (e.g. around 800 or 1000 ), and form factors (even under $330 for some 10.100 hybrid devices, e.g. Asus‚Äô tablet- netbook Transformer line, compared to $329 for 7.900 iPad mini). Hence a mini-notebook‚Äôs (netbook‚Äôs) or ultra-slim PC‚Äôs (ultra- portable‚Äôs) price and weight are dynamic due to features and hardware (and/or software) platforms, and a larger device is not necessarily more expensive or heavier than a smaller one (yet still remain its competitive advantages).  1.2.  Literature review  Some researches have sought to optimize display size and object scale for motion-transforming input devices (e.g., for mouse see Tr√§nkle and Deutschmann (1991), Jakobsen and Hornb√¶k (2011, May); for touchscreen see Oehl et al. (2007)). In the study of mouse experiments, the results indicated that the cursor moved more slowly on a smaller display. The display size effects might be acknowledged as a cognitive effect which surpassed the signiÔ¨Åcant effects of task difÔ¨Åculties. Participants were observed to respond carefree in using the larger display so that the cursor movements were quicker than on the smaller display (Tr√§nkle and Deutschmann, 1991). A recent study (Jakobsen and Hornb√¶k, 2011; May) of laser mice also reported that the display size ef- fects in the performances of geospatial tasks (using maps of large cities) on a small display were more profound compared to me- dium and large ones (small: 17.3  7.1 cm, 640  267 pixels; me- dium: 52.0  21.3 cm, 1920  800 pixels; large: 156.0  64.0 cm, 5760  2400 pixels; 94 PPI in all conditions). In terms of task completion time and subjective satisfaction, interactive visualiza- tion techniques worked well for multi-scale navigation on the (with 700 medium and large displays but not on small displays screens diagonal). However, there was no further study of small to medium sized displays to investigate the optimal size with a bal- ance between portability and performance. The effects of display sizes were also seen in a study of touchscreen (with styli) experiments (Oehl et al., 2007). The study showed a strong effect on pointing performances in applied multidirectional serial tapping tasks. A TFT touchscreen (1024  768 pixels) was used. The three different display sizes were created by a software program and represented the bright area with the rest area of display kept dark and idle. In this sense, the pixel density (w85.33 PPI) would be the same across the three sizes of displays. The display sizes were 6.00  8.00 cm, 12.00  16.00 cm, and 18.00  24.00 cm with 3.9400 , 7.8600 , and 11.7200 screens di- agonals, respectively. The study showed that the tasks were less effective in smaller displays than larger displays. It also suggested to lower task difÔ¨Åculties for smaller display sizes. Nevertheless, up to now, the impact of display effects and its interaction with pixel sizes for the tasks with Ô¨Ånger-operated touchscreens were not investigated yet. Regarding the size effects of input devices, a study of graphic tablets steering tasks (Accot and Zhai, 2001) revealed that device (active tablet area) sizes and movement scales inÔ¨Çuenced input tasks with a U-shape performance-scale function. The small scales (57  38 mm and 28  19 mm) and large scale (455  303 mm) degraded task performances because their performances were limited by motor precision and the arm dexterity, respectively;  1500  
1108  C.-C. Lai, C.-F. Wu / Applied Ergonomics 45 (2014) 1106e1115  whereas medium range scales (227  151 mm and 114  76 mm) did not signiÔ¨Åcantly inÔ¨Çuence performances. An early research of keyboards (Yoshitake, 1995) also indicated device size effects that keyboard sizes hindered further reduction for the sizes of small computers. Keys scale reduction would inÔ¨Çuence keyboard avail- ability, while the small keyboard with 16.7 mm key center-line spacing had no performance degradation compared to a conven- tional keyboard (with 19 mm key center-line spacing). Although there have been many studies of input devices tasks, the literature did not provide any experimental evidence of the possible in- teraction(s) between display size effects and the size effects of the touchpad or keyboard. Thus, this study investigated the effects on the performances of these input devices, and illustrated the in- teractions between the display size effects and the device size effects. Besides, previous researches (e.g., Sutter et al. (2011); Sutter and ZieÔ¨Çe (2004)) speciÔ¨Åed that target size (i.e., target width W) played an important role more than distance (i.e., amplitude A) did in task difÔ¨Åculty. The differences in movement times for similar IDs (i.e., index of difÔ¨Åculties) but different distance/width combinations were observed in the authors‚Äô touchpad and trackpoint experi- ments. To calculate movement time based on Fitts‚Äô law (index of difÔ¨Åculty ‚ÄòID‚Äô modiÔ¨Åcation by MacKenzie (1992)), target size and distance are used as the decisive variables with the following (A/W √æ 1)): equation using Shannon formulation of ID (log2 T ¬º a √æ b log2 (A/W √æ 1). The pointing technique and/or device being used empirically determined the constants a and b. For a proportional change in cursor movement distance (amplitude) A and target‚Äôs width W (results in a different combination of A and W), the ID should remain the same but the scale effect would reÔ¨Çect in different a and b as a different device being used. As a result, the observed movement times were longer with nearer but smaller targets than those with farer but larger targets, and vice versus. However, none of these studies provided direct evidence of this incompatibility to Fitts‚Äô law for the device (touchpad or touchscreen) size effects in common daily (data-processing) tasks or of the interaction(s) between the size effects of the display and devices for mini-notebooks (netbooks)/ultraportables/tablets PCs. Thus, this study examined the direct evidence of this in- compatibility by comparing the performances of these input de- vices with different pixels sizes, and illustrated the interactions between the effects in the results and discussion section.  1.3.  The research hypothesis and objectives  According to the above literature review, it was presumed that cursor movements‚Äô perceptive effects would make the sizes of displays and built-in devices signiÔ¨Åcantly and mutually inÔ¨Çuence cursor movement speed on the displays of (hybrid/convertible) mini-notebooks (netbooks)/ultraportables/tablets PCs. In other words, this study was intended to examine the display and device size effects of mini-notebooks (netbooks)/ultraportables as a reference to the usability of the Mobile PCs with similar small form factors (and their hybrids or convertible modes). The objectives of the study were divided as follows:  (1) To explore the size effects of different built-in devices on operation efÔ¨Åciencies and the impacts of display sizes on other built-in devices of mini-notebooks (netbooks)/ultra- portables in common and complex contexts of applied tasks. (2) To understand the optimal touchscreen, touchpad, and keyboard sizes of mini-notebooks (netbooks)/ultraportables. (3) To explore the user preferences on the screen sizes of mini-notebooks (netbooks)/ultraportables for different operations.  2. Materials and methods  2.1.  Pre-study  In the questionnaire pre-study described below, the usage of built- in input devices of notebooks was preliminarily investigated. The subjects were 22 college and graduate students (12 male) from Tatung University in Taipei City. The ages of the participants ranged from 20 to 45 years, and their average age was 26.38 years. They were different from thirty volunteer participants mentioned on page 8. All of them had experience with notebook PCs (twelve used notebook PCs on a daily basis, four on a weekly basis, Ô¨Åve on a monthly basis, and one on a basis of ‚Äúother‚Äù (other than the above classiÔ¨Åed frequencies)). The questionnaire included questions regarding what kinds of applica- tions and task patterns the subjects mostly used notebook PCs to engage in and what software they mostly used. Similar with the re- sults of CEA research study mentioned in the introduction, the results of the pre-study survey showed that Internet surÔ¨Ång and words processing were the most common applications mostly using online real-time communication software, Internet browsers and other related software. This result was used as the base to design the operational tasks of the main study.  2.2. Main study  2.2.1.  Participants  The unpaid volunteer participants of the study were thirty col- lege and graduate students (15 male) from Tatung University in Taipei City. They did not participate in or learned about the pre- study mentioned on page 7. The ages of the participants ranged from 19 to 43 years (M ¬º 27.23; SD ¬º 5.10). All of them had expe- rience with notebook PCs. Sixteen participants extensively used touchpads and physical keyboards (e.g., laptops, desktop computers) but only had moderate experience using touchscreen devices (e.g. ATM, information kiosks), and fourteen reported extensive experi- ence with touchpads, physical keyboards, and touchscreen devices (e.g., touchscreen phones). Twelve of them used notebook PCs on a daily basis and eighteen of them on a weekly basis. All the partici- pants did not know the purpose of the study.  2.2.2. Apparatus  Generally, the major built-in input devices of mini-notebooks (netbooks) were divided into three types: touchpads, touchscreens, and keyboards. The sizes and types of built-in input devices from different brands slightly varied. Similar to the screen sizes of (hybrid/ convertible) tablet devices and ultraportables/mini-ultrabooks, the mini-notebooks (netbooks) were mainly with screen sized from 700 to 11.600 and with 82%e95% of full-size notebook keyboard. Thus, this study evaluated the representative models: ASUS Eee PC 701SD, 900HA, 1000HG, and 1101HA which were equipped with 700, 8.900 , 10.100, and 11.600 screen diagonals, respectively. The screen resolutions of the models were set to 800  480, 1024  600, 1024  600, and 1366  768 pixels, with displayed pixel density of 133, 133, 118, and 135 PPI (pixels per inch), respectively. The pixel size of all the displays was around 0.19  0.19 mm except the one of 10.100 display was around 0.22  0.22 mm, and the refresh rate of all displays was set to 60 Hz (a that default value). These four models were equipped with keyboards which were 82%, 82%, 92%, and 95% of regular notebooks‚Äô keyboards (the center-to-center spacing of alphanumeric keys was 15  11 mm, 15  11 mm, 16.6  15.9 mm, and 17  16.5 mm), respectively. To Ô¨Åt in the keyboards, their touchpads were nearly proportionally shrunk with the sizes of 45  43 mm, 63  38 mm, 63  38 mm, and 65  50 mm, respectively. A comparable RAS (resistive) touchscreen was installed to each model to compare the touchpad and touchscreen performances on the same model. Each model installed Intel√í Atom

The dimensions of tested touchscreens, pixels, touchpads, and keyboards as well as the weights of the four models are listed in Table 1. The tasks were performed with the full screens of the 700, 8.900 , 10.100, and 11.600 mini-notebook (netbook) displays, respectively. The tasks and measuring interfaces were written in Microsoft Visual Basic. The general interfaces of the software referred the Windows interface. To use the default CD gain value and functions in the Windows XP Operating system across the four models, the cursor movement was not changed in the default ‚ÄúMouse Properties‚Äù panel with ‚ÄúEnhance pointer precision‚Äù enabled and affected by acceleration.  2.2.3. Measures  2.2.3.1.  Experimental design.  In the study, the tests were divided into two parts. The Ô¨Årst part comprised two independent variables: the model size (i.e. mini-notebook size) and task type. The model size was divided into four levels depending on the screen size of the models. The task type was divided into Ô¨Åve levels depending on the input devices and patterns of tasks. The second part of the exper- iment was to Ô¨Åll in subjective evaluation questionnaires. Depen- dent measures comprised operating times, error rates, and the evaluations of discomfort, application, and preference.  2.2.3.2.  Task design. According to the results of the pre-study sur- vey, Internet surÔ¨Ång and words processing were the most common applications; in addition, the most commonly used task types were point-and-click/tap for pointing devices and touch typing for typing devices. This result was used as the base to design the operational tasks of this study. Furthermore, Fitts‚Äô style tasks (more focused experiments) were using to further characterize Internet surÔ¨Ång and word processing on displays. This study followed An- nex B in the ISO 9241-9 standard ‚ÄúErgonomic requirements for ofÔ¨Åce work with visual display terminals, Part 9: Requirements for non-keyboard input devices‚Äù (ISO, 2002) recommendations to design the purposes, patterns, and steps of Tasks 1e4. Besides, since the design of tasks was geared towards imitating interfaces in the real world, some locations of point-and-click/tap targets were designed to be pre-cued (known) but some were non-pre-cued (not known) to the user before visually identifying it. Hence, there were Ô¨Åve tasks designed in the main study. Tasks 1 (multi-direction clicking) and 2 (multi-direction tapping) were simple tasks. Task 3 (successive selecting and clicking), Task 4 (suc- cessive selecting and tapping), and Task 5 (typing) were complex tasks. In Tasks 1and 2, the selections of the center icon were pre- cued, while the selections of icons surrounding the center icon were not pre-cued. As for tasks 3 and 4, in more random layouts, the icons were non-pre-cued but the subsequent icon was indicated once the previous one had been selected. In Task 5, touch-typing was utilized to evaluate the performances of word processing. While ‚ÄòÔ¨Ånding targets‚Äô would somewhat differ from normal computer use where the user has to locate objects with much background infor- mation, this study mitigated the possible incurred impact by pre- senting the pre-cued and non-pre-cued objects to better imitate the situations in the real world. As in the real world, for Tasks 1e4, only  dominant hands were required to perform the trials while non- dominant hands could hold the mini-notebooks when appropriate. To operate in the most efÔ¨Åciency manners, both right and left hands were required to perform all the trials of Task 5. The descriptions of Tasks 1e5 are summarized in Table 2. The testing screen displays for Tasks 1 and 2 are indicated in Fig. 1, those for Tasks 3 and 4 are shown in Fig. 2, and that for Task 5 is shown in Fig. 3. The recording software written in Microsoft Visual Basic was able to record the operating times, errors, and processes of Tasks 1e 4. Camtasia Studio 4 (screen recording software) was used for Task 5 to record the real-time screen during the task for each tester. The operating times and errors of Task 5 were also recorded. The resolutions and colors of the icons displayed in all the tasks to the default value of Windows as 32  32 pixels (i.e., 6  6 mm for the 700, 8.900 , and 11.600 models; 7  7 mm for the 10.100 were set model) and grayscale. For Tasks 1 and 2, the distance (i.e., cursor movement distance, simply called ‚Äòdistance‚Äô in the rest of the pa- per) from ‚ÄúS‚Äù (Start) to ‚ÄúF‚Äù (Finish) was 200 pixels (i.e., 38.25 mm for the 700, 8.900 , and 11.600 models; 43.75 mm for the 10.100 model). For Tasks 3 and 4, the total distance from ‚ÄúButton 1‚Äù to ‚ÄúButton 5‚Äù in sequence was 1000 pixels (i.e., 191.25 mm for the 700, 8.900 , and 11.600 the 10.100 model). The IDs for Tasks 1e4 models; 218.75 mm for remained the same as 2.86 bits (¬ºlog2 (A/W √æ 1)) despite both the distance and the target‚Äôs width for the 10.100 model tasks were proportionally larger than those for the other tasks.  ‚ÄúF‚Äù  2.2.3.2.1. Task 1 (multi-direction clicking) and task 2 (multi-di- rection tapping).  In Task 1 (multi-direction clicking), ‚ÄúS‚Äù (Start) icon Ô¨Årst appeared on the testing screen display. (See Fig. 1) The participant focused the start icon with the touchpad. After the ‚ÄúS‚Äù icon had been clicked and disappeared, (Finish) icon subse- quently appeared on the display. Participants clicked the ‚ÄúF‚Äù (Fin- ish) icon and completed one trial and a new trial was presented. Likewise, in Task 2 (multi-direction tapping), the participant focused the start icon with the touchscreen. (See Fig. 1) The Ô¨Årst step was to tap the ‚ÄúS‚Äù (Start) icon (located at the center of the screen), and the second step was to tap the ‚ÄúF‚Äù (Finish) icon. In Tasks 1 and 2, each participant performed the tests 8 times on each model in different directions as one set of tests and Ô¨Ånished three sets for each task (i.e., 8 repetitions  3 sets ¬º 24 trials). According to ISO multi-direction tapping task (ISO (2002); Sena and Moschini (2006)), Tasks 1 and 2 were simpliÔ¨Åed to locate each ‚ÄúF‚Äù (Finish) icon in eight directions (0 , 45 , 90 , 135 , 180 , 225 , 270 , and 315 ) relative to the (Start) icon. All the directions of clicking and tapping targets were included in Task 1and Task 2, respectively. According to the most common applications investi- gated in the pre-study, users proceeded with pointing and clicking (touchpad)/tapping (touchscreen) at the graphic user interface (GUIs) to interact with selecting targets such as icons, menus, or hyperlinks. To imitate these usage situations, Tasks 1 and 2 (the simple tasks) included both the pre-cued center icon and the non- pre-cued icons surrounding the center icon.  ‚ÄúS‚Äù  2.2.3.2.2. Task 3 (successive selecting and clicking) and Task 4 (successive selecting and tapping).  In Task 3 (successive selecting and clicking), the participant used the touchpad to successively select and click icons.

The subsequent icon was indicated once the previous one had been selected. The successive steps of the tasks were to click from ‚ÄúButton 2‚Äù to ‚ÄúButton 5‚Äù in sequence. Likewise, in Task 4 (successive selecting and tapping), the participant used the touchscreen to successively select and tap icons. (See Fig. 2) The Ô¨Årst step was to tap ‚ÄúButton 1‚Äù, and the following successive steps of the tasks were to tap from ‚ÄúButton 2‚Äù to ‚ÄúButton 5‚Äù in sequence. In Tasks 3 and 4, each participant performed the tests 5 times on each model as one set of tests and Ô¨Ånished three sets for each task (i.e., 5 repetitions  3 sets ¬º 15 trials). According to the pre-study, the most common software applications contained pull-down menus for frequently-used basic control. To imitate this usage situation, Tasks 3 and 4 (the complex tasks) were integrated the two patterns of single tasks ‚Äòselecting‚Äô and ‚Äòpointing‚Äô (‚Äòclicking‚Äô with touchpad in Task 3 and  2.2.3.2.3.  ‚Äòtapping‚Äô with touchscreen in Task 4), and included the selections of the non-pre-cued icons (buttons) at different positions each time. Task 5 (typing). As for Task 5, its task type was to use a keyboard to touch type. All test materials were presented in the column of a window.

The order of  the screen size across participants was counterbalanced to minimize the learning effect. The participants conducted tests on different input devices sizes and operating tasks in different orders. The experimental envi- ronment was set up as shown in Fig. 4. The chair height and angle were adjusted to suitable positions by the participants. To avoid glare, each participant properly tilted the screen panel of the notebook PC. Referring the previous research and guidelines (Ankrum, 1996; Human Factors Society, 1988; Shieh and Lee, 2007), the distance from the screen to the eyes of each participant was maintained at 60e70 cm. Their viewing angles were set to keep the line of sight and the screen panel at around 90 . All the participants readily recognized the icons and their display on the screens. Before starting the experiment, the participants were briefed on the process of the study, the built-in input devices, and operational tasks. Participants were requested to proceed with the tasks as fast and correctly as they could, and they had to complete all the tasks. Each participant performed 12 sets of operations per tasks (4 sizes of models  3 sets of task operations). To minimize the learning effect, the experiments were conducted in two days, and there was at least a one-day interval between the two days. There were half experiments conducted in each day.  2.2.4. Analysis  2.2.4.1. Data collection. The operation times and processes of the tasks were recorded after the recording software had been started. Errors were recorded for Tasks 1e4 and deÔ¨Åned as clicks or taps made that were not within target boxes. Errors for Task 5 comprised corrected and uncorrected errors collected from all three paragraphs  Fig. 3. The testing screen display for Task 5.  Fig. 4. The experimental environment.  and then combined for each input device. A corrected error was deÔ¨Åned as a sequence of consecutive backspaces occurred. An un- corrected error was deÔ¨Åned as any error occurred in the Ô¨Ånal string. After Ô¨Ånished a block of experiments (6 sets of task operations in one day), every participant immediately Ô¨Ålled in a subjective assessment (Likert Nine-point Scale) with Ô¨Åve variables: ‚Äòhardware discriminability‚Äô (i.e., visual discriminability for screen), ‚Äòcursor movement‚Äô, ‚Äòtouchpad performances‚Äô, ‚Äòtouchscreen performances‚Äô, and ‚Äòkeyboard performances‚Äô. (See Appendix) There were three bipolar response scales for each of the variables: (1) Uncomfortable e Comfortable, (2) DifÔ¨Åcult e Easy to apply, (3) Dislike e Like. Each response was rated with 9 as the most favorable response and 1 the least favorable response. Since the ‚Äòprice‚Äô and ‚Äòweight‚Äô of a mini- notebook (netbook)/superportable are dynamic due to platform and/or additional features, a larger mini-notebook (netbook) is not necessarily more expensive or heavier than a smaller one, and vice versa. Therefore, these two factors (‚Äòprice‚Äô and ‚Äòweight‚Äô) were not included in the subjective evaluation of this study.  2.2.4.2. Analysis methodology. There were Ô¨Åve repeated measures  ANOVA models performed for the Ô¨Åve tasks. Each model (a repeated-measures ANOVA for each of the Ô¨Åve tasks) compared differences in mean operating time or error rate over the four model sizes. SigniÔ¨Åcant overall F tests were followed by post-hoc pairwise comparison tests with a Bonferroni adjustment for a ¬º .00833 (¬º0.05/6) to account for the six pairwise comparisons between four model sizes. For subjective measures, the rating data were analyzed with descriptive statistics.  3. Results and discussion  3.1. Analysis on objective performances of  tasks  3.1.1. Model size effects  Repeated-measures ANOVAs on the operating times showed signiÔ¨Åcant main effects for the factor ‚Äòmodel size‚Äô (Task 1: F (3, 87) ¬º 47.452, p < .001; Task 2: F (3, 87) ¬º 16.502, p < .001; Task 3: F (3, 87) ¬º 6.260, p ¬º .001; Task 4: F (3, 87) ¬º 11.495, p < .001; Task 5: F (3, 87) ¬º 18.597, p < .001, all p‚Äôs < 0.00833). As shown in Table 3, the mean operating times in all tasks for the 11.600 (largest) model and 700 (smallest) model were the lowest and highest, respectively. The effect sizes for the factor ‚Äòmodel size‚Äô in all the tasks exposed large strength of associations between the model size and the  
1112  C.-C. Lai, C.-F. Wu / Applied Ergonomics 45 (2014) 1106e1115  operating time (partial eta squared value, all h2 p > 0.138). It revealed that model size explained most dependent variance (operating time). With a mean below 5%, the error percentages were not signiÔ¨Åcantly different between each other. In this study, the par- ticipants executed rather correctly and the results were in accor- dance with those of our lab‚Äôs another research regarding similar touchpad tasks (Wu et al., 2008). Some other researches (e.g., for touchscreen see Sears (1991); for keyboard see Wiklund et al. (1987)) have also revealed no signiÔ¨Åcant effect on error rate.  3.1.2. The effects and interactions of display sizes, pixels width, and device sizes  The results of the mean operating times in this study showed that the models with smaller display sizes performed the tasks more slowly, and vice versa. This phenomenon was similar to the results of previous studies (e.g., Oehl et al. (2007)). On the other hand, the re- sults demonstrated that the differences in movement times for the same (or similar) IDs but different distance/width combinations were also consistent with previous studies (e.g., Sutter et al. (2011), Sutter and ZieÔ¨Çe (2004)). The physical dimensions of the target sizes and distances on the 10.100 display were proportionally larger than those of 8.900 the display owing to their slightly different pixel widths (0.22:0.19). Therefore, in the analyses of Tasks 1e4, the operating times were lower for the 10.100 model than for the 8.900 model. As post-hoc pairwise comparisons showed, however, the differ- ences were not signiÔ¨Åcant (all p‚Äôs > 0.00833) in the operating times for all the tasks between the 8.900 and 10.100 models, the 8.900 and 11.600 models, as well as the 10.100 and 11.600 models, respectively, excluding the performances for the keyboard tasks (Task 5) between the 8.900 and 11.600 models (p ¬º .001 < 0.00833). The reason might be that the differences of display sizes (effects) of the 8.900 , 10.100, or 11.600 models were not largely different from each other (10.100 vs 8.900 ¬º 1:0.88; 11.600 vs 10.100 ¬º 1:0.87; 11.600 vs 8.900 ¬º 1:0.77). Similarly, the differ- ences were not signiÔ¨Åcant between the pixel widths of the 8.900 and 10.100 models (0.19:0.22 ¬º 1:1.15). In addition, there was no interac- of the 10.100 and 8.900 models. tion between the effects of display size and pixel size discrepancies On the contrary, the differences were signiÔ¨Åcant (p ¬º .001 < 0.00833) in the operating times for the keyboard tasks between the 8.900 and 11.600 models. It might be because the reduced the 8.900 model was signiÔ¨Åcantly different from that of the 11.600 one size (center-to-center spacing of alphanumeric keys) of keyboard of (17  16.5 mm vs 15  11 mm ¬º 1:0.59); the device (key) size effect (or the device size effect plus the display size effect) caused the signiÔ¨Åcant differences in the operating times. operating times for all the tasks between the 700 model and the other Besides, the differences were signiÔ¨Åcant (all p‚Äôs < 0.00833) in the three sized models, excluding the differences between the 700 and 8.900 models for the complex touchpad tasks and for keyboard tasks (i.e., Task 3: successive selecting and clicking, and Task 5: typing; both p‚Äôs > 0.00833), respectively. It might be because of the large discrepancies between the reduced display sizes (induced intense display size effect) of the 700 model and the 10.100 and 11.600 models (10.100 vs 700 ¬º 1:0.69, 11.600 vs 700 ¬º 1:0.60), respectively. On the contrary, the reason for the above two exceptional non-signiÔ¨Åcant differences for the complex touchpad tasks and for keyboard tasks between the 700 and 8.900 models might be that the comparatively small discrepancies between the reduced device sizes (induced de- vice size effects for touchpads: 63  38 mm vs 45  43 mm ¬º 1:0.81; 15  11 mm vs for the key center-line spacing of keyboards: 15  11 mm ¬º 1:1) affected the input devices performances more than the display size effects did (8.900 vs 700 ¬º 1:0.79). However, compared with the very same discrepancy (1:0.81) between the the 700 and 10.100 models, reduced device (touchpad) sizes of the intense display size effect for the large discrepancy of the reduced  display sizes (10.100 vs 700 ¬º 1:0.69) inÔ¨Çuenced the touchpads‚Äô per- formances more than the device size effect did.  3.1.3. The effects of the display sizes and the discrepancy of display sizes for non-keyboard tasks  The differences were signiÔ¨Åcant (all p‚Äôs < 0.00833) in the oper- ating times for the simple touchpad tasks (Task 1: multi-direction clicking) and touchscreen tasks (Task 2: multi-direction tapping, Task 4: successive selecting and tapping) between the 700 and 8.900 models‚Äô performances although the discrepancy of the display sizes (8.900 vs 700 ¬º 1:0.79). On the contrary, the dif- was not signiÔ¨Åcant ferences were not signiÔ¨Åcant (p > .00833) in the operating time for 11.600 8.900 models (11.600 8.900 ¬º 1:0.77) even though the discrepancy of the two display sizes Tasks 1, 2 or 4 between the and vs was larger than that of the former one (8.900 vs 700 ¬º 1:0.79). It might be because the 700 (smallest) display induced more effects of display size compared to the 11.600 (largest) display for relatively simple tasks comprised Tasks 1 and 2 (simple tasks) and Task 4 (the touchscreen tasks were relatively simple because of the ‚Äúintuitive‚Äù task type).  3.1.4. The effects and interactions of display sizes, device sizes, and clock speed and/or RAM sizes  Generally, some models of mini-notebooks (netbooks) allowed for overclocking or underclocking of the systems using appropriate util- ities (e.g., Eee Super Hybrid Engine utility let users overclock or underclock their Eee PCs). Although functionality, performance, and other beneÔ¨Åts of the feature of CPU might vary depending on system conÔ¨Åguration, it seemed that the differences in clock speed or RAM size might inÔ¨Çuence the effects of display and/or input devices on the performances of the models. To see the size effects of display and/or input-devices and avoid the potential confounding effects of the per- formances by separating from the interactions in between the feature of CPU and RAM, this study uniÔ¨Åed each of the systems with processor and memory speciÔ¨Åcations at same clock speed, cache, and FSB Speed (Intel√í Atom Z520 CPU: 512K Cache, 1.33 GHz, 533 MHz FSB), and RAM size (2 GB). In terms of increasing clock speed and RAM size, the size effects might be enhanced or reduced accordingly; however, the incurred inÔ¨Çuences might be insigniÔ¨Åcant because the executing and controlling efforts needed even in the complex tasks (such as touch- pad and keyboard tasks) might not be signiÔ¨Åcantly different.  3.1.5. The optimal model size(s) balance between portability and usability in speciÔ¨Åc tasks  Basically, smaller display sizes and device sizes induced porta- bility and also implied more intense effects of display size and device size on performance degradation. For the four sizes of the 11.600 and 700 models performed the fastest and the models, slowest, respectively. The results of this present study conÔ¨Årmed its hypothesis and demonstrated which model size(s) could optimally the 10.100 balance between usability and portability. The sizes of model‚Äôs built-in display and input devices were reduced but not the 11.600 model‚Äôs largely discrepant from those of (as the com- the 11.600 model vs the 10.100 model, 1:0.87 for parison for their displays, 1:0.74 for their touchpads, and 1:0.94 for their keyboards); as a result, the difference was not signiÔ¨Åcant between the perfor- mances of the 10.100 and 11.600 models. With mixed effects of display size and device size, even the performances for non-keyboard tasks of the 8.900 model were not signiÔ¨Åcantly degraded.  3.2. Analysis on users‚Äô subjective assessments  After analyzed the results of the subjective assessments (see Table 4), it was found that most of the participants had the highest and lowest preferences on the built-in input devices and individual the 11.600 and 700 models (with total score 7.74 and 4.01), tasks of  
respectively. The total scores of the 10.100 and 11.600 models (7.07 vs 7.74) were fairly close to each other while there were big differences between the total scores of the 10.100 and 8.900 models (7.07 vs 5.71).  3.3. The relevance of the Ô¨Åndings in industries: appropriate form- factor (in size) to speciÔ¨Åc task type  Overall, the advantages of a portable/mobile device with a clam- shell form factor would be remained with its integrated touchpad and keyboard, which might beneÔ¨Åt the performances of documents and spreadsheets editing. From the results of the objective and subjective measures, it was found that the 10.100 model well balanced between the needs of portability and performance with all integrated display and in-put devices. Considering the most preferred choice of the participants and the fastest performance, the 11.600 diagonal screen might best Ô¨Åt in the hybrid or convertible modes of the tablet and mini-notebook (or ultraportable/ultrabook). However, in the view point of manufacturing, the sizes directly impact the costs of the displays; therefore, the 10.100 portable/mobile devices might be more likely affordable than the 11.600 ones. Furthermore, while the 8.900 model performed with signiÔ¨Åcant degradation for typing tasks; its constrained keyboard with touchpad might be improved by taking an advantage of a non-conventional touchpad with rearranged positions of buttons (Wu et al., 2013). At least, with adequate performances in all non-keyboard tasks, the 8.900 model was still good in terms of its high portability and relatively lower costs of smaller display and features. Besides, according to a recent study of laser mice (Jakobsen and Hornb√¶k, 2011; May) that also reported the display size effects on mice in task completion time (the display size effects on a small display were more profound compared to medium and large ones), it might be likely to attain the results of display size effect similar to that on the touchpads tested in the ‚Äúmulti-direction clicking‚Äù and ‚Äúsuccessive selecting and clicking‚Äù tasks of this study. As for the error rates, Among a great deal of researches comparing touchpad and a mouse, some recent studies have indicated high accuracy of mice tasks (e.g., Jakobsen and Hornb√¶k (2011, May)) and no main effect or interactions between a touchpad and a mouse on error rates (e.g., Hertzum (2013)). Therefore, it seems that the size effects on error rates of mice performances would be also similar to that of touchpad tasks. With the point of view that Mice are still popular for use with portable devices, although the results of this study might imply  similar results on Mice, it would be worthy to verify the display size effect on mice in most commonly used (point-and-clip) tasks.  4.  Conclusions  As the results revealed, it seemed that the closer the touchpad/ touchscreen/keyboard sizes to the regular sizes, the shorter the operation times. Therefore, the differences were not signiÔ¨Åcant in operating times between the 10.100 and the 11.600 models. It was observed that both the effects of display sizes and device sizes on the input devices affected movement times, and the task complexity and/or the constrained device sizes signiÔ¨Åcantly inÔ¨Çu- enced whether the display size effects would be enhanced or reduced by device size effects on motor controls. These above re- sults were consistent with the results of signiÔ¨Åcant scale effects in path steering and typing tasks (e.g., Accot and Zhai (2001); Yoshitake (1995)) and display size effects in simple pointing and multidirectional pointing tasks (e.g., Tr√§nkle and Deutschmann (1991); Oehl et al. (2007)) performances, respectively. Basically, the subjective assessments conÔ¨Årmed the objective measures. As the results showed, the larger the model size, the higher the score in subjective measure (including ‚Äòvisual discrimi- nability for screen‚Äô, ‚Äòcursor movement‚Äô, ‚Äòtouchpad performances‚Äô, ‚Äòtouchscreen performances‚Äô, and ‚Äòkeyboard performances‚Äô).

1114  C.-C. Lai, C.-F. Wu / Applied Ergonomics 45 (2014) 1106e1115  Overall, for all input devices tasks, the 10.100 model was as fast as the 11.6 model and the 8.900 model was as fast as the 10.100 model. For the touchpad and touchscreen tasks, the 8.900 model even could be as fast as the 11.600 model. It seems that the 8.900 one might be ideal for performances in touchscreen and touchpad tasks. However, given the similarity of the performance results of the 3 larger screens, the 10.1 size strikes a good balance between size of characters on screen and keyboard, weight of device, battery life, selling price, and user preference. Without signiÔ¨Åcant degradation, all input devices per- 10.100 model formances of the experimentally rationalized the the 10.100 diagonal screen (33% among the existing domination of tablet computers) in the market (Wikipedia Contributors, 2013a, 2013b) even though buyers drive the mini-notebook (netbook)/ ultraportable (as well as hybrid or convertible tablet/ultrabook) the 11.600 diagonal market toward larger screen sizes and prefer screen. Consequently, considering the effects of device size, users  could be suggested to select the 10.100 mini-notebooks (tablet-net- books, ultraportables/mini-ultrabook, or their convertible hybrid tablet modes) with all the optimal input tasks performance and portability, the 11.600 one with the best performance and slightly less portability, or the 8.900 one with superiority in portability and good tasks performance (except for typing).

s0003687014000210,"  School furniture is not the only cause of pain and discomfort reported by school children. However, being seated for a long period of time in school furniture is being associated with reports of musculoskeletal discomfort and pain (Fallon and Jameson, 1996). Also, school furniture dimensions, within the context in which it is used, may have an impact on some physical aspects of the students. For example, the high level of mismatch between students and school furniture is being associated with adolescent low back pain (Milanese and Grimmer, 2004). A relationship between furniture mismatch and postural overload is also reported by Batist√£o (2010), because when the seat height is low, students increase upper back left inclination and right upper arm elevation, and when the seat is short, students decrease the upper back Ô¨Çexion velocity and in- crease right upper arm elevation.  * Corresponding author.

Furthermore, Sents and Marks (1989) show, in a laboratory setting, that all children earned higher scores on the intelligence test when seated in furniture that suited their body sizes compared to bigger sized school furniture. This Ô¨Ånding was corroborated by Wingrat and Exner (2005), when students were seated in 2 different sizes: traditional classroom furniture and appropriately sized desks and chairs. Smith-Zuzovsky and Exner (2004) reveals that students from 6 to 7 years old, who were seated in furniture that Ô¨Åt them well, performed signiÔ¨Åcantly better on the manipu- lation test than those who were seated in furniture that was too big for them. The above situation reveals the great importance of deÔ¨Åning school furniture dimensions in an appropriate way. Despite that, there is a large number of studies worldwide that show a clear mismatch between anthropometrics characteristics and the di- mensions of school furniture (e.g., Afzan et al., 2012; Castellucci et al., 2010; Chung and Wong, 2007; Dianat et al., 2013; Gouvali and Boudolos, 2006; Molenbroek et al., 2003; Panagiotopoulou et al., 2004; Parcells et al., 1999; Saarni et al., 2007). However, Gouvali and Boudolos (2006) state that the equations used to examine the match or mismatch between school furniture and anthropometric dimensions can be problematic in the sense that  0003-6870/$ e see front matter √ì 2014 Elsevier Ltd and The Ergonomics Society.

Castellucci et al.  / Applied Ergonomics 45 (2014) 1123e1132  they are sometimes based on contradictory criteria, originating from theory that has not necessarily been conÔ¨Årmed with research. The main aim of this paper is to review literature that describes the criteria equation for deÔ¨Åning the mismatch between students and school furniture, to apply the different mismatch equations to a speciÔ¨Åc sample, and to propose a methodology to evaluate school furniture suitability.  2. Method  2.1.  Literature review  One literature database, Scopus, was used to identify the studies carried out in the Ô¨Åeld of mismatch or Ô¨Åt between anthropometric measures and classroom furniture. The search terms used were ‚Äúschool furniture‚Äù and ‚Äúclassroom furniture‚Äù (Fig. 1). The inclusion criteria for the selection of the relevant papers are all reviewed articles that are original studies, written in English, and published between January 1980 and January 2013. The literature review was orientated toward the deÔ¨Ånition of the mismatch equations. Studies that only present a proposal of a new dimension set size for school furniture, based on, for example, the application of percentiles, were not considered. Potential mismatch equations were grouped according to the part of the school furniture considered, namely:   Chair dimensions;  Interaction between chair and table dimensions.  All mismatch equations, one- and two-way, were considered. For those cases where both the minimum and maximum limit were considered, a two-way equation was considered appropriate and for those with only a maximum or a minimum limit, a one-way equation was the required option.  2.2.  Field procedure  2.2.1.  Sample  The considered sample involved a group of students, with ages ranging from 5 to 19 years old (11.9  3.5 mean), from basic and secondary schools in the Valparaiso Region of Chile. Fourteen schools were randomly selected from a list given by the Regional Ministerial Secretary of Education and the selection used a cluster design regarding the three types of elementary school adminis- trations in Chile, as well as of the economic background level of the corresponding students. The sample study consisted of 2261 volunteer subjects (1259 male and 1002 female). The data collection started after written authorization was obtained about the study from the headmaster of the school, which was followed by the collection of the written authorizations obtained from all parents and students.  2.2.2. Anthropometric measurements  The anthropometric measurements were collected from the right side of the subjects, while they were sitting in an erect posi- tion on a height-adjustable chair with a horizontal surface, with their legs Ô¨Çexed at a 90 angle, and with their feet Ô¨Çat on the Ô¨Çoor or an adjustable footrest. During the measurement process, the subjects were without shoes and wearing light clothing (shorts and t-shirts). All measurements were taken with a Harpenden standard anthropometer (Holtain Ltd., UK), with an exception made to sub- jects‚Äô stature, which was measure with an estadiometer. The following anthropometric measures (ISO 7250, 1996) were considered and collected during this study (Fig. 2):  2.2.2.1.  Stature. Determined as the vertical distance between the Ô¨Çoor and the top of the head, and measured with the subject erect and looking straight ahead (Frankfort plane).  2.2.2.2.

Statistical analysis  All the anthropometric data were analyzed using MS Excel and SPSS (v20.0). After the different equations were applied, categorical data (Low mismatch, Match and High mismatch) were analyzed. The Kappa statistic was applied to measure the degree of agree- ment between the different equations. kappa is a good tool to assess inter-rater reliability, particularly for qualitative items (match/mismatch). In this study was used to determine the level of inter-rater reliability of the equations. In studies where the agreement between two or more ob- servers/diagnostic test (equations) are an important factor, values can be compared by a statistic that takes into account the fact that observers/diagnostic test will sometimes agree or disagree simply by chance. The kappa statistic (or kappa coefÔ¨Åcient) is the most commonly used statistic for this purpose (Viera and Garrett, 2005). A kappa of 1 indicates perfect agreement, whereas a kappa of 0 indicates agreement equivalent to chance.  3. Results and discussion  3.1.  Criteria equation for mismatch  Fifteen studies were found to meet the criteria described above (Fig. 1). The results from the studies are as follows:  3.1.1. Chair dimensions 3.1.1.1.  Seat height (SH). This can be considered the most important dimension for the development of a mismatch criterion, since all the studies considered in this review applied an equation to test the Ô¨Åt of SH (Table 1). Also, it should be considered as the starting point and the most important variable for the design of the classroom furniture (Molenbroek et al., 2003; Castellucci et al., 2010). Regarding this dimension, two main equations can be found in the literature (Table 1). One is based on the biomechanics of the knee (Equation (1)), considering that SH needs to be lower than PH so that the lower leg forms a 5e30 angle relative to the vertical and that the angle range will permit the student to sit in a chair high enough so that both feet are placed on the Ô¨Çoor. On the other hand, the seat should be low enough to avoid and extension of more than 30 relative to the vertical in the knee joint. This is very important since with more extension, the feet will not be placed Ô¨Çat on the Ô¨Çoor or the thighs would not be supported enough, generating discomfort. The other equation includes 2 options (Equations (2) and (3)), but both are based on the fact that SH has to be evaluated in rela- tion to the PH percentage. In the three different equations, a two-way mismatch criterion is considered. Only one equation (Equation (1)) considers the use of shoe correction (SC).  3.1.1.2.  Seat depth (SD). This was used in the majority of the studies (14), being the second most common measurement. This furniture  dimension can be evaluated using two equations that use the principle of percentage, but differ in the percentage of Buttock Popliteal Length (BPL) that is considered. This difference only af- fects the high limit of the equations in 4%, with 95% of the BPL and 99% of the BPL for Equations (4) and (5), respectively (Table 1).  3.1.1.3.  Seat width (SW). This was applied in a few studies (Table 1) and can be tested by two equations. Both equations consider that SW should be higher than Hip Width (HW), and consequently, both equations take low limit or low mismatch into account. Moreover, Equation (7) suggests that SW should be at least 10%, but not more than 30% larger than HW in order to provide proper seating, while making an economic use of space.  edge  of  backrest  (UEB). one-  3.1.1.4. Upper  and two-way limit equations were found for calculating these dimensions. Equation (8) is based on the percentage of SHH. However, none of the studies explain in detail why they used 60% and 80% of SHH. In order to avoid the compression of the scapula and a reduction in arm and trunk mobility (Garcia-Acosta and Lange-Morales, 2007; Orborne, 1996), Equation (9) is based on a one-way equation and tests if Subscapular Height (SUH) is higher than UEB.  3.1.2. Interaction between chair and table dimensions 3.1.2.1. Underneath desk height  (UDH). This was evaluated in 7 studies and the equivalent dimension, Seat to Desk Clearance (SDC), which is obtained from the difference between UDH and SH, was only used once (Table 2). Both of these dimensions, UDH and SDC, reveal a great diversity of approaches and, consequently, of equa- tions. Furthermore, three anthropometric measures can be used to deÔ¨Åne the level of furniture mismatch (TT, PH, and KH). UDH has to be large enough in order to allow the students to push the chair under the table and to have enough space to allow leg movement. Accordingly, Equations (10), (11) and (13) propose that the desk clearance should be 2 cm higher than KH. In addition, Equation (13) allows for shoe correction (SC) and it raises the very interesting point that the high limit used tries to solve one of the major problems regarding two main school furniture dimensions, UDH and DH. This high limit assumes that UDH cannot be higher than the maximum DH minus the table thickness. This problem will be discussed at the end of this section. Equation (12) considers SDC appropriate when it is higher than TT. Equation (14) paints an un- clear picture when one takes into consideration that 20 cm is (proportionally) a very different amount for students of 6 or of 17 years old.  3.1.2.2. Desk height (DH). This is the furniture dimension with the greatest number of equations in the literature. However, most of these were based on EHS, as the minimum height of DH. Also, the maximum DH, with the exception of Equation (17), depends on shoulder Ô¨Çexion and shoulder abduction angles of 25 and 20 , respectively (ChafÔ¨Ån and Anderson, 1991). Most of the equations are two-way, with the exceptions of Equations (18) and (19), which only considered the high mismatch. This might be a mistake, in the authors‚Äô opinion, since a low mismatch in this equation may orig- inate an increase on spinal loading (Occhipinti et al., 1985). Equa- tion (15) is based on the assumption that students were sitting in a chair with a proper SH, which does not seem to be realistic. Equation (17) is established to test the high limit and a Ô¨Çat 5 cm is added to every EHS, this may lead to some problems since the angles of abduction and Ô¨Çexion of the shoulder joint will not be the same for students with different EHS and SHH. Equations (16), (20) and (21) are quite similar but they do differ in certain respects. The latter two equations include the seat height, while Equation (16) tests SDH. Additionally, the backward slope of the chairs is

Field results  3.2.1. Anthropometric measures  The descriptive statistics of the ten anthropometric dimensions of the students from the fourteen different schools are presented in Table 3.  3.2.2.  School  furniture dimensions  Before presenting and analyzing the school furniture of the different schools, it is important to mention that the sample included primary schools (1st to 8th grade, age 6e12), secondary schools (9th to 12th grade, age 13e18) and others with both levels. Due to this variability, some differences were observed regarding the number and type of desks and chairs that exist in each school. The different number of furniture types ranged from 1 to 4 and are represented in Table 4.  3.3. Application of  the different criteria equation for mismatch  After replacing the existing classroom furniture dimensions in each mismatch criterion equation, the established limits and the body dimensions of the students were compared.  3.3.1.  Seat height  It is important to mention, that 2 cm of shoe sole was consid- ered. As expected, there are differences in the results of the three different equations (Fig. 4). Furthermore, there are considerable differences between the two most frequently used equations  (Equations (1) and (2)). The result of Kappa Statistics shows slight (k ¬º 0.12) and fair (k ¬º 0.38) agreement between Equation (1) with Equations (2) and (3), respectively. To improve the analysis, shoe correction (SC) was considered for Equations (2) and (3). This discrepancy in the results was reduced and the result of Kappa statistics shows moderate (k ¬º 0.46) and (k ¬º 0.91) between Equation (1) with almost perfect agreement Equation ‚Äú2 with SC‚Äù and ‚Äú3 with SC‚Äù, respectively. Since the anthropometric measurements in the all studies were made without shoes, the non-consideration of SC appears to affect the overall results in the different studies that applied Equations (2) and (3). The conclusions of those studies appears to overestimate the number of students using a higher seat, a situation where the students would not be able to rest their feet on the Ô¨Çoor, generating increasing pressure on the tissue of the posterior surface of the knee (Garc√≠a-Molina et al., 1992; UNESCO, 2001; Milanese and Grimmer, 2004). Finally, even though Equations (2) and (3) are based on the same principles, the results of the mismatch show differences between them since Equation (3) is less strict. Kappa statistics indicates a moderate agreement between Equations (2) and (3) (k ¬º 0.44).  3.3.2.  Seat depth  Fig. 5 shows that 7% of high mismatch is the difference between the results of the two equations. On the other hand, the lower limit and the results of low mismatch remain the same for the two equations. The slight difference is conÔ¨Årmed by the result of an almost perfect agreement between equations (k ¬º 0.82). Despite the Kappa results, considering the high limit of Equation (5), the students could have a space corresponding to 1% of their BPL be- tween the front edge of the seat and the popliteal region. Using the  
sample from this research, the space mentioned before will be between 2.8 and 5.4 mm, which is too small if one considered the fact that the anthropometric measurements were made with the students using shorts, like most of the reviewed studies. When wearing regular clothes, the students could be in a more uncom- fortable situation mainly due the compression of the popliteal surface. Furthermore, to avoid this situation, students will sit for- ward and will not be able to use the backrest of the seat in a proper way (Milanese and Grimmer, 2004). This erroneous use of the backrest would most likely generate a kyphotic posture (Khalil et al., 1993; Pheasant, 1991).  3.3.3.  Seat width  Fig. 6 shows almost double the level of low mismatch in Equa- tion (7) when compared to Equation (6). The results of Kappa sta- tistics show a moderate agreement range between Equations (6) and (7) (k ¬º 0.51), where the difference is due to a margin of 10% in Equation (7). It is important to mention that the high mismatch was not considered in the Kappa statistic and can be considered to be of secondary importance due to the fact that it mostly affects the optimization of the space used rather than the student‚Äôs seating posture. Finally, it can be concluded that Equation (7) is a stricter equation since it uses a margin of 10%. It seems relevant to highlight that this margin is more important for ofÔ¨Åce chairs than for school chairs due to the more frequent use of arm support in the former case.  3.3.4. Upper edge of backrest  Fig. 7 presents the results of Equations (8) and (9). Taking into consideration that Equation (9) only has one limit, the results of mismatch are presented only as high mismatch. In this respect, it is possible to observe some differences between the results of these equations. Furthermore, the results of the Kappa statistic show a moderate agreement (k ¬º 0.43). Lastly, Equation (8) needs to be analyzed more carefully since it assumes that UEB should be be- tween 60% and 80% of the SHH. However, in the reviewed studies citing this equation (see Table 1) there is no detailed explanation or justiÔ¨Åcation for the use of these limits percentage values. In au- thors‚Äô opinion, it is possible that 80% of SHH is at the higher limit of the UEB and, in this case, it can be considered similar to SUH in Equation (9). Paired Sample T-Tests (with 95% conÔ¨Ådence intervals) were performed to examine the differences between 80% of SHH and SUH, considering the whole sample. The obtained results show that the values of 80% of SHH are signiÔ¨Åcantly higher than SUH (t ¬º 7.3; p ¬º 0.001). This situation is reÔ¨Çected in the low levels of high mismatch from Equation (8) (Fig. 7). Additionally, the low limit considered in Equation (8) is somehow difÔ¨Åcult to understand because the main problem is when UEB is higher than SUH. It is also important to mention that there is an interaction between UEB and the Lowest Edge of Backrest (LEBR), as well as with the Height of Backrest (HBR).  3.3.5. Underneath desk height or seat to desk clearance  Fig. 8 shows that the Equations (10), (11) and (13) present the lowest level of mismatch, since those equations consider KH as the highest point of the lower limbs and compare this with UDH. Those equations seem to be based in the erroneous assumption that KH is higher than SH √æ TT. Furthermore, the majority of the students, like in most of the studies reviewed, were using a high seat (Fig. 4), the difference between SH √æ TT and KH. which will increase Equation (12) reveals a 52% mismatch since it compares SDC to TT.

Also, the principles of Equation (14) are wrong since they take into consideration the PH of the students, the measure used to deÔ¨Åne the SH, adding 20 cm Ô¨Çat, which is proportionally very different for students in the range of 6e17 years old.  3.3.6. Desk height or seat to desk height  From Fig. 9, it is possible to observe that there are very high levels of high mismatch, but not many differences between the considered equations. Equations (16) and (20) present a perfect (k ¬º 1), since those equations are similar, except agreement that they evaluate SDH and DH, respectively. Equations (19) and (21) have the same level of high mismatch and the Kappa statistics (k ¬º 0.99). Although, shows an almost perfect agreement it is important to emphasize that Equation (19) only tests the high mismatch. The consideration of backward slope in Equations (19) and (21) seems to be the main cause of the differences in the re- sults with Equations (16), (18) and (20). As an example, the Kappa statistics show a substantial agreement between Equations (21) and (16) (k ¬º 0.68), between 21 and 18 (k ¬º 0.69), and between 21 and 20 (k ¬º 0.68).  Equation 17, the one that uses 5 cm Ô¨Çat to deÔ¨Åne the high level or the maximum SDH, presents similar results when compared with the other equations. Furthermore, the Kappa statistics of Equation (17) show an almost perfect agreement with Equation (16) (k ¬º 0.89), 18 (k ¬º 0.86), and 20 (k ¬º 0.89) as well as a sub- stantial agreement with Equation (19) (k ¬º 0.59) and 21 (k ¬º 0.59). This last result seems to be related to the consideration of backward slope, since the consideration of this aspect in Equation (17) leads to a Kappa statistic showing an almost perfect agreement with Equation (21) (k ¬º 0.98). These results suggest that the use of Equation (17), considering also the use of the backward slope, can be considered as an alternative to Equation (21), in particular when the researcher did not gathered the SHH. An issue that seems to lead to a very important discussion is the interrelation between the mismatch equations applied to test the Ô¨Åt of DH and UDH. Sometimes the proposed equations can be contradictory, even in ideal conditions. To better explain this situ- ation, it is possible to consider the following assumption: the high limit of Eq. 21 e (SH √æ Eq. (12) √æ table thickness) < 0, and that will be the ‚ÄúHigh Mismatch‚Äù. This assumption leads us to the Equation (22):  EQ 3 with SC  EQ 3  EQ 2 with SC  EQ 2  EQ 1  Low Mismatch  Match  High Mismatch  EQ 5  EQ 4  Low Mismatch  Match  High Mismatch  0%  20%  40%  60%  80%  100%  0%  20%  40%  60%  80%  100%  Fig. 4.

Considering the data of the 2,261measured students and applying Equation (22), the results show that 37% of the students will use a high DH or will have a high mismatch regarding DH. This situation shows that there is a problem in the criteria formulation for some of the presented equations. As it was mentioned before, the design and evaluation of school furniture begins with SH. Secondly, the students need an under table space that should be large enough to push the chair under the table and have enough space to allow for the movement of their legs. Having said that, there are not many changes that can be made to the SDC equation (Equation (12)) since it is a convenient equation for the determination of the needed space. On the other hand, DH or SDH equations need to be evaluated in the Ô¨Åeld or in laboratory; for example, the criteria presented by ChafÔ¨Ån and Anderson (1991) does not take the elbow or forearm support into consideration, which may be used to reduce the strain on the shoulder (Feng et al., 1997; Slot et al., 2009). Furthermore, there are some authors who suggest that, for writing and drawing with the forearm or elbow supported, the table should be positioned at 10 cm above EHS (Pheasant, 2003; Kroemer and Grandjean, 1997). However, as it was mentioned before, this could cause some prob- lems since 10 cm above EHS is not necessarily the same for a student of 6 years or for a student of 18 years old.  3.4. Methodology of evaluation of school  furniture suitability  This proposed methodology considered the evaluation of six furniture dimensions (Table 5). Despite that, there are some main furniture dimensions that have to be considered within this type of research, speciÔ¨Åcally those that are frequently used in the reviewed studies: SH, SD, SDC, and DH. To apply the different equations, re- searchers will have to considerer the following anthropometrics measures: PH, BPL, HW, SUH, TT, EHS, and SHH. The current methodology is based in a bottometop approach. This requirement stems from the fact that SH is the most important  EQ 9  EQ 8  Low Mismatch  Match  High Mismatch  H.I.

As it was shown before in Fig. 4, SC needs to be considered in the SH formula. It is also necessary to consider that SC may naturally vary according to culture, fashion, and country. To get more representative values of the sample under study, an option is to measure the shoe heel of the students or measure the shoe heel through a national consumers‚Äô survey (Castellucci et al., 2010). If this situation is not possible for the re- searchers, an alternative option is to consider SC as a value between 2 cm (Agha, 2010; Dianat et al., 2013; Gouvali and Boudolos, 2006) and 3 cm (Castellucci et al., 2010). There are also other authors who recommended SC with values between 2.5 (Herzberg, 1972) and 4.5 cm (Pheasant, 1984). In the case of SDC, if the researchers have only gathered KH, TT can be estimated with the following equation:  √∞KH   PH√û*1:7  (23)  This equation was developed using the average and standard deviations of PH, TT, and KH from different databases (Musa, 2011; Pheasant, 2003; Savanur et al., 2007). Furthermore, if SDC was not gathered, UDH can be used instead, by applying the following equation:  SDC ¬º UDH   SH  (24)  Regarding SDC and DH, it is important to keep in mind, as dis- cussed earlier, that the interrelation between the mismatch equa- tions applied to test the Ô¨Åt of DH and UDH are based on contradictory criteria. Despite this, DH needs to be evaluated with Equation (21) (Parcells et al., 1999). To apply this equation properly, the seat angle has to be measured and replace the X backward  EQ 21  EQ 20  EQ 19  EQ 18  EQ 17  EQ 16  EQ 15  Low Mismatch  Match  High Mismatch  0%  20%  40%  60%  80%  100%  0%  20%  40%  60%  80%  100%  Fig. 7.

If the seat has a forward slope or positive angle it will be: SH √æ SD * sinX . Finally, it is important to considerer the cumulative Ô¨Åt or transversal mismatch, which is deÔ¨Åned as the mismatch that takes into account the cumulative values of the different furniture di- mensions. This can be considered as a very important indicator of the furniture Ô¨Åt, since it shows how many students are actually matched to the dimensions of their school furniture. The order to apply the cumulative Ô¨Åt is the same as this proposed methodology, i.e., through a bottometop approach.  4.  Conclusion  The results that have been obtained indicate that 6 furniture dimensions are evaluated with a high number of applied equations. For SH, the most evaluated furniture dimension, there are consid- erable differences between the two most frequently used equa- tions. Additionally, one of these equations does not consider shoe correction. In the case of SD, there are not many differences be- tween the two applied equations. Regarding UEB, the equations are based on principles that are not fully explained by the corre- sponding authors. Most of the equations regarding UDH or SDC present one sys- tematic error, which is to assume that students are sitting on a chair with a proper seat height. It should be also acknowledged that the interrelation between the equations for evaluating the level of mismatch of SDC and DH are based on contradictory criteria and therefore, it will be neces- sary to develop new equations for these parameters and validate them. Finally, the proposed methodology for the evaluation of school furniture suitability should allow for a more reliable and accurate analysis of school furniture.

s0003687014000222,"  In the current globally networked economy more and more people tend work in multiple time zones resulting in almost 24 h running of organizations and increasingly longer ‚Äúvoluntary‚Äù working hours, which is akin to long-shift hours (Dorrian et al., 2011). In addition to this, mobility of human, goods and services is another implicit requirement to cater this growing global econ- omy. Road transportation networks play as one of the critical facilitator for short and medium haul of people and goods thereby helping the mobility. However the down side of this mode of transportation is the number of accidents which appears as large owing to the volume of trafÔ¨Åc. India, a major emerging economy driven by this globalization, road networks are a key in-land linkage. According to a report by National Crime Records Bureau, road accidents in 2009 reported 35.5% death rate in India (Government of India, 2010). It is argued that up to 40% of the accidents in road transportation system worldwide is due to driver error which may be a result of fatigue (Connor et al., 2002; Horne and Reyner, 1995; Roads and TrafÔ¨Åc Authority, NSW, 2011).

Board (2010) has reported driver fatigue as a probable cause for road accidents that result in Ô¨Ånancial losses, injuries and even fatalities. It has been demonstrated that people engaged in long shift- work have a circadian disruption, i.e., changes in sleep patterns, which often leads to sleep deprivation and its associated ailments (√Ökerstedt et al., 1987; Darwent et al., 2012; Rosekind et al., 1994). Disruptions in circadian rhythms and sleep pattern results in decreased alertness, impaired activity, tiredness and possibly fa- tigue (Bonnet, 1985). These impediments manifest itself broadly as fatigue disrupting several activities of daily living, one of which is for vehicle drivers. Fatigue decreases an individual‚Äôs ability to operate vehicles safely and reduces situation alertness. There are many factors that may cause the driver to be fatigued. It results from the complex interaction of various factors (Kecklund and √Ökerstedt, 1993; Young et al., 2006), of which mainly: 1. Environmental factors such as road surface irregularities, low density trafÔ¨Åc, time of day, rain, fog, etc, 2. Biological factors such as inadequate sleep, circadian rhythms, health, age, etc, 3. Socio-economical activities such as long work- shifts, increased work load, alcohol, drugs, etc and 4. Vehicle fac- tors such as noise, vibration and postural stress that are created by the vehicle itself, poor suspension, seat and vehicle design, de- mands on both physical and mental processes. Detection of driver fatigue is a major concern in vehicle design, road safety and transportation research. However a serious impediment to address  Please cite this article in press as: Jagannath, M., Balasubramanian, V., Assessment of early onset of driver fatigue using multimodal measures in a static simulator, Applied Ergonomics (2014), http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2014.02.001  fatigue

A written informed consent was taken from the volunteers to enrol as participants in the study. All experimental procedures were performed using a static driving simulator in a controlled environment of the laboratory.  2.2.  Simulation task  The static driving simulator comprises of steering wheel with force feedback, gear shift lever, foot pedals and a projection of the driving environment for visual feedback (Fig. 1). A commercially available (‚ÄòNeed for Speed‚Äô, Electronic Arts 2010) driving environ- ment was used for the study. The driving environment selected for this study was a highway with low trafÔ¨Åc density. All participants were allowed approximately 30 min of driving practice session to get accustomed to the controls used in the simulator. After the practice session, participants were given a break of 20 min away from the simulator and were allowed to have unconstrained movement within the laboratory. Participants were then required to sit on the driver‚Äôs seat in their comfortable driving postures. The angle between the thigh and the trunk was between 110 to 120 . Then they commenced their 60 min of testing after a quick check of all instrumentation.  2.3. Multimodal physiological signal analysis  It was found essential to determine both physical and mental aspects of fatigue in order to accurately validate the driver‚Äôs level of alertness. Hence, simultaneous recording of the following multi- modal signals were obtained during the monotonous driving session.  2.3.1.  Surface electromyographic analysis  Extensor carpi radialis (ECR), biceps brachii (BB), medial deltoid (MD), trapezius medial (TM), sternocleldomastoid (S), latissimus dorsi medial (LDM) and erector spinae (ES) muscle-groups were evaluated bilaterally for this study. Muscle-groups were chosen based on preliminary studies for implication in driving, intensity of signal generated and accessibility of muscle for electrode applica- tion. Before placing the measurement electrodes, the placement site were identiÔ¨Åed, shaved, and cleaned with ethanol to avoid impedance mismatch and movement artifacts. sEMG signals were acquired using 16 channel EMG machine (Wireless Myomonitor IV, Delsys Inc., Boston, MA) at a sampling rate of 1000 Hz. Raw sEMG  driver fatigue is the difÔ¨Åculty and most times the inability to detect it.  Several papers have suggested methods for quantifying driver fatigue based on subjective and objective measurements. Subjec- tive measurements are based on self-rating tests by means of questionnaires (Caldwell et al., 2003). One of the major drawbacks of this method is that it is either conducted before and/or after the event. This can probably lead to drivers forgetting important issues that they perceived or experienced during the course of driving. Objective measurements of driver fatigue are categorized as: vehicle parameters such as change in the steering wheel rotation, acceleration, speed of the vehicle, braking and lane tracking etc (Apostoloff and Zelinsky, 2003) and physical movements such as eye closure and blink rates, tracking of facial expression, etc by using video imaging techniques (Zhu and Ji, 2004). Major problems with these approaches are their sensitivity to external factors such as luminance and vibration that the driver experiences in the real driving scenario. Moreover, they could detect only the outcomes of fatigue and they do not predict the occurrence of fatigue before. There are some blood biochemical parameters that are also used for evaluating driver fatigue. However such testing often is invasive and disadvantageous in analysis. Similarly the disadvantage of psychological tests is that they often make heavy demands on the subjects, which will raise the level of cerebral activity. The above issues can be overcome by appropriate indices of driver fatigue which would be some sort of physiological measures to quantify both physical and mental skills associated with driving performance. Different physiological and psychophysiological parameters are contributed for the Ô¨Çuctuations of alertness, activation and per- formance degradation. It is of particular importance to isolate them precisely in order to understand their contribution to human functioning system. To better understand the driver fatigue and train the key stakeholders in the road transportation, simulations and simulators are extensively used (Waller, 1992; Young et al., 2006). Several advantages like safety, security, exposure to high- hazard and cost-effectiveness are there in using simulators in lieu of on-road training. Increasingly, driving simulators that represent realistic environment with force feedback and motion platform are now popularly used to examine driver behaviour, performance and attention (Eoh et al., 2005; Land and Horwood, 1995). The reliability of driving simulators coupled with ease of experimentation has prompted us to use a static simulator with force feedback in steering to study the physical and mental aspects of driver fatigue during monotonous driving. Since driver fatigue has multiple causal pathways and early symptoms, we decided to adopt a multimodal monitoring of the driver performance. We have used surface electromyography (sEMG) to understand the muscle activity, electroencephalogram (EEG) to understand brain activity, seat pressure distribution and other measures of physical exertion like blood pressure such as heart rate, oxygen saturation level to quantify driver fatigue during monotonous simulated driving. Hence a multimodal technique of detecting driver‚Äôs status/condi- tion can provide reliable results in terms of both physical and mental fatigue.  2. "
s0003687014000234,"  House painters are a sub-group of construction workers with a high reported incidence of shoulder complaints (Stenlund et al., 2002). These shoulder complaints have in turn lead to a high risk of early retirement with disability pensions related to shoulder injuries (Lindbeck et al., 1997). Supraspinatus tendonitis is a com- mon shoulder injury incurred by house painters (Stenlund et al., 2002). According to a research study funded by The Center to Protect Workers‚Äô Rights conducted in Washington, D.C. (Hunting et al., 2004), 5% of injured construction workers reporting to emergency rooms over a 7-year period were painters and 4% of all construction workers had shoulder-related injuries. Repetitive strain injuries are the most common and costly occupational health problem according to the U.S. Department of Labour (RSI Statistics, 2007). The cost of a worker compensation claim for a repetitive stress injury is between $20,000 USD and $100,000 USD (RSI Statistics, 2007).  * Corresponding author.

Limited research exists evaluating the effects of painting or sanding techniques on shoulder loading. However, research by Stenlund et al. (2002) has examined this speciÔ¨Åcally for ceiling work. Researchers described three possible techniques employed by the worker. Of these three techniques, the ‚Äúpushing technique‚Äù produced the least amount of strain on the supraspinatus muscle. This technique required the worker to hold an extension handle with both thumbs pointing upwards while they moved the shaft back and forth in the sagittal plane. The main difference between this technique and others (the ‚Äúnormal grip‚Äù and ‚Äúreversed grip‚Äù) was the way in which the shaft was moved; with the remaining techniques requiring pivoting and rotating movements. Re- searchers used a biomechanical model to predict individual supraspinatus muscle forces, which were expressed as relative values proportionate to the respective maximal capacities of the supraspinatus muscle. The average normalized supraspinatus muscle force was 5.19% for the ‚Äúreversed grip‚Äù technique, 5.11% for the ‚Äúnormal technique‚Äù and 2.15% for the ‚Äúpushing technique‚Äù. Similarly, workers who used the ‚Äúpushing technique‚Äù reported fewer shoulder disorders, suggesting that this technique may reduce the occurrence of shoulder tendonitis. No further research has been presented that examines shoulder loading during vertical

Additionally, the inÔ¨Çuences of paint tool design on shoulder loading remain unknown; with few attempts made to improve the tool‚Äôs original design from an ergonomic perspective. Though the research examining wall painting speciÔ¨Åcally is limited, other researchers have evaluated tasks that involve com- parable upper extremity loading. The design of current paint roller handles require elevated shoulder postures in order to perform horizontal paint strokes. Numerous research studies have docu- mented that arm elevation leads to large increases in shoulder muscular activity levels (Chopp et al., 2010; DeLuca and Forrest, 1973; Walker and Poppen, 1977; Sigholm et al., 1984; Inman et al., 1944; Hagberg, 1981). This increase in muscle activity can subsequently lead to muscle fatigue development (Grieve and Dickerson, 2008) and subsequent pain and discomfort (Wiker et al., 1989). SpeciÔ¨Åcally, occupations that involve elevated arm tasks may lead to ‚Äúdegenerative tendonitis‚Äù in the biceps and supraspinatus muscles (Bjelle et al., 1973, 1987; Herberts et al., 1981; Hagberg, 1988). Due to the high incidence of shoulder pain among house painters, it is critical to evaluate the work-related factors that may contribute to excess shoulder load demands and provide recommendations for reducing the risk of upper extremity discomfort. House painting is a task performed by both genders, which is an important consideration that needs to be addressed. Females are more strength limited than males, with differences greater than 50% in the upper extremity (Miller et al., 1993). As this task has the potential for signiÔ¨Åcant upper extremity loading, it is important to evaluate the possible additional demand experienced by females from executing the same wall painting task. The purpose of this study was to investigate the inÔ¨Çuence of gender, work height, and paint tool design on shoulder muscle activity and the horizontal force applied to a vertical paint surface by the paint roller during simulated wall painting. This included testing four speciÔ¨Åc linked hypotheses:   Females will demonstrate increased muscle activity compared to men for a given painting task. This is based on the established lower upper limb strength of females, and the consistent paint tool designs used in the study (Miller et al., 1993).  Work height will inÔ¨Çuence shoulder muscular activity during simulated wall painting, such that the middle work height produces the lowest muscular loading. This is consistent with other studies that have shown middle or low work heights to have lower mechanical demand for electrical meter installation (Chopp et al., 2011), and lower subjective ratings for a screw- driving task (Ulin et al., 1990) than high work heights.  The force exerted on a wall will not differ across all work heights as the external task requirements are the same.  Different paint tool designs will inÔ¨Çuence the level of shoulder muscular activity associated with simulated wall painting due to their difference in weight, as well as the postures that partici- pants will adopt when using the painting tools.  2.

The job is physically demanding, and HCWs often perform dangerous tasks, such as moving and trans- ferring clients, without the help of co-workers or assistive devices. HCWs employed by private agencies may beneÔ¨Åt from some su- pervision and safety training. However, independent HCWs are isolated and dependent on their clients, who are generally un- trained private citizens, to provide safe working conditions. Not surprisingly, HCWs have elevated musculoskeletal problems rela- tive to other occupational groups (Jellema et al., 2002; Ono et al., 1995; Simon et al., 2004; Tuomi et al., 1991; Zeytinoglu et al., 2000), and a lost-time injury rate that is 3e4 times higher than the US average (Bureau of Labor Statistics [BLS], 2010). The need for safety interventions is magniÔ¨Åed by projections that HCW employment will grow by 70% by 2020 (BLS, 2012) to meet the needs of the growing elderly population (Administration on Aging, 2011).  
1158  R. Olson et al.  / Applied Ergonomics 45 (2014) 1157e1166  1.1. Measuring hazards and exposures in home care  Despite the need for assessment and intervention research with HCWs, there is a relative paucity of relevant safety studies. Prior research with HCWs has focused on measuring injury prevalence and worker perceptions about the causes of stress and strain (Baron and Habes, 2004; Kim et al., 2010; Meyer and Muntaner, 1999; Myers et al., 1993; WipÔ¨Çi et al., 2012). This research shows that HCWs are at greatest risk of experiencing musculoskeletal injuries to the low back, shoulders, and knees, and that lost time injuries are likely to be triggered by manual material handling and client lifts/transfers (Ono et al., 1995; Hess et al., 2007; Nelson et al., 2003; WipÔ¨Çi et al., 2012). Other physically demanding tasks that may generate unusual postures and contribute to injuries include changing bedding and assisting clients with bathing and toileting (BLS, 2012). Workers‚Äô perceptions about injury hazards are aligned with injury data. HCWs in two independent focus group studies identiÔ¨Åed several tasks as highly physically demanding or causing high concern for injury: unassisted client lifting and transferring; supporting clients while walking or catching while falling; push/pull/lift wheelchair; bath- ing; moving household objects; and cleaning bathrooms, Ô¨Çoors, and kitchens (Baron and Habes, 2004; WipÔ¨Çi et al., 2012). While certain caregiving tasks have been implicated as hazard- ous, we know little about actual task exposure levels among HCWs. Direct physical or observational measurement is ideal, but is rare among isolated working populations due to the effort and time required (Olson et al., 2009). If we are to gain a greater understanding of exposures and intervention needs among HCWs, observational methods for measuring worker postures and task exposures (e.g., Rapid Entire Body Assessment; Hignett and McAtamney, 2000) must be supplemented with validated worker self-assessment methods. Ergonomic self-assessment research has predominantly focused on the reliability, bias, and validity of one-time ergonomic self- assessment surveys or ratings (Barrero et al., 2009a, 2009b; Hollmann et al., 1999; Spielholz, 2006; Spielholz et al., 2001; Wiktorin et al., 1993), and using survey measures to model or predict objective outcomes (e.g., Trask et al., 2010). In general, this literature suggests that worker self-assessments can be systemat- ically biased, but also that workers are able to reliably self-assess exposures to a range of events that are easily discriminated or intense, and that these self-ratings can predict safety-related criteria. As an example of systematic bias, Barrero et al. (2009b) found that workers overestimated the duration of physically demanding tasks and underestimated less physically demanding tasks, and that these biases were inÔ¨Çated among participants who completed the tasks in a discontinuous pattern. As an example of the validity of worker self-reports, Trask et al. (2010) found that workers reports of task exposures following their workshift explained 21e36% of the variance in electromyography (EMG) of lumbar muscles during the workshift (versus direct observation of work characteristics explaining 31e47% of variance in EMG activity). While one-time ergonomic self-assessment surveys are useful, the data produced do not provide information about variability in task exposures that occur over time. In this regard, ecological momentary assessment (EMA) methods may provide enhanced ergonomic self-assessment data. In EMA participants are cued by alarms or events in their environment to self-monitor events, be- haviors, or psychological states as they occur over many days or weeks. EMA (Bolger et al., 2003; Green et al., 2006) reduces retrospective bias and improves the reliability and validity of self- report data (Stone et al., 1998). However, EMA remains a self- report method, and while computerized EMA programs time stamp each self-monitoring instance, the accuracy of a participant‚Äôs isolated self-recordings about their behavior may be difÔ¨Åcult to  assess. While we are not aware of any previous EMA research with HCWs, the approach has been applied in similar working pop- ulations such as nurses (Johnston et al., 2006). Most relevant to the current project, two prior studies have evaluated the reliability of EMA to measure safety-related task exposures. Unge et al. (2005) used EMA to measure task exposures among ofÔ¨Åce workers and hospital cleaners for 10 days, while experimenters observed several concurrent days. Workers produced reliable self- assessment data for most primary work tasks, including exposure to visual display unit work, which is a risk factor for musculoskeletal problems. In a study with a lone working population, Olson et al. (2009) evaluated truck drivers‚Äô self-assessments of non-driving work tasks and postures relative to video-based observations. Drivers were highly reliable at self-recording hazards that were environmental, relatively frequent, and easy to discriminate, such as receiving assistance from a forklift operator. Drivers were less reli- able at self-assessing postural exposures, such as severe trunk Ô¨Çexion or rotation. These two studies demonstrate that workers can produce moderately reliable measures of work exposures using EMA methods, especially frequent and easily discriminated events. The research also demonstrates the practical value of EMA for measuring exposures among isolated and dispersed populations. To address gaps in research and practice and extend EMA Ô¨Åndings to HCWs, we created and evaluated an ergonomic self- assessment tool named Home Care STAT (Safety Task Assessment Tool). The STAT was programmed into a handheld computer, and a daily diary style study was designed to: 1) measure daily task ex- posures in a sample of HCWs, 2) evaluate the reliability of the STAT by comparing worker self-assessments to data from researcher observations, and 3) evaluate the criterion-related validity of the STAT by conducting correlational and multi-level analyses of as- sociations between person-level and daily work task factors with psychophysical symptoms and lifestyle behaviors.  2. Material and methods  2.1.  Participants  All participants worked as independent contractors for clients who qualiÔ¨Åed for publicly funded in-home care services in Oregon. Participants were recruited from training courses offered by the Oregon Home Care Commission and through SEIU Local 503 communications, and were required to work at least two days per week as a HCW and reside within the study metropolitan area. A total of 23 participants consented and completed all study procedures. The Ô¨Ånal sample was predominantly female (n ¬º 22) with a mean age of 47.5 yrs (SD ¬º 12.7), a mean body mass index (SD ¬º 7.4), of 29.9 and was 57% minority, including African (n ¬º 5), Asian (n ¬º 2), Native American (n ¬º 2), American Hispanic/Latino (n ¬º 2), and other (n ¬º 2). Participants worked an average of 34.1 h per week (SD ¬º 17.8) and had been working as (SD ¬º 6.2). HCWs for a mean of 6.2 years The majority of participants were single (divorced, separated or never married; 52%) and had an average of 13.2 years of education (SD ¬º 2.4).  2.2.  Study design and observation methods  The study employed a repeated measures daily diary design, where repeated daily measures were nested within individual participants. Participants Ô¨Årst completed a demographic and background survey and received brief training with the STAT. Par- ticipants were then asked to use the STAT for the next 10e14 days to self-record task exposures during workdays, and a range of symptoms and behaviors every evening (including non-workdays). This design structure, with 23 participants  10e14 days, possesses

Study participation concluded with either an in-home obser- vation of the participant at work (dependent upon client consent; n ¬º 14 of 23), or a debrieÔ¨Ång meeting with researchers. Observa- tions were conducted by the Ô¨Årst three authors, who were involved in STAT development and intimately familiar with variable deÔ¨Åni- tions. As additional training, each researcher watched 2 h of safety training videos for HCWs in order to become familiar with and observe many repetitions of common home care tasks before going into the Ô¨Åeld. Each observation lasted until the participant had completed 10 work tasks, or until the observation duration reached 2 h. During the observation participants continued to complete their STAT self-assessments during natural breaks (which typically occurred during transitions between tasks), while the observer independently recorded the occurrence and duration of work tasks in vivo. Participants knew that researchers were observing their work, but were not aware that the primary purpose was to estimate the reliability of their self-observations. All measures of inter-rater agreement in the study were comparisons of a single researcher with a single worker during in-home observations.  2.3. Demographic and background measures  In addition to demographics reported in section 2.1, the de- mographic and background survey included measures of self- reported height and weight, concern for personal injury during work tasks; and self-reported injuries in the past 12 months. Par- ticipants also reported physical symptoms (3 items from the Physical Symptoms Inventory; Spector and Jex, 1998), life satisfac- tion (4-item Satisfaction with Life Scale; Diener et al., 1985), 12- month and past 7 day physical pain and discomfort (9-item Nordic Musculoskeletal Questionnaire: Kuorinka et al., 1987); fa- tigue (8-items from the Swedish Occupational Fatigue Inventory; Ahsberg, 2000); perceived stress (4-item Perceived Stress Scale; Cohen et al., 1983); positive and negative affect (8-item PANAS; Watson et al., 1988); sleep adequacy (1-item; Buxton et al., 2009); exercise (7-item International Physical Activity Questionnaire [iPAQ]; Ainsworth et al., 2000); and dietary habits (4-items: sugary snacks, sugary drinks, fast food; as described in Buxton et al., 2009; plus a fruit and vegetable item created for the current study). Some demographic and background measures were adapted for the current study. SpeciÔ¨Åcally, fatigue was assessed using two of the four subscales from the Swedish Occupational Fatigue Inventory (lack of energy, physical discomfort). Exercise was measured using the short version of the iPAQ (Ainsworth et al., 2000), however, the time-anchor period was changed from the past 7 days to the past 4 weeks to be consistent with the reference time period for all other behavioral scales in the survey. Finally, we created an item to measure fruit and vegetable consumption using the same scaling as the 3-item survey of high sugar and high fat food consumption (as described in Buxton et al., 2009; 1 ¬º never to 10 ¬º 5 or more times per day).  2.4. Daily Home Care STAT measures  The STAT was developed to help workers self-monitor their ex- posures to demanding and/or dangerous work tasks, along with daily physical symptoms, health behaviors, and mood states. To accom- plish these measurement goals the STAT included two question sets: a work task survey and an evening survey. Question sets and branching schemes were programmed using survey development software (SurveyToGo, Dooblo Ltd., Kfar Sava, Israel) for adminis- tration on handheld computers (HP iPAQ 110, HewlettePackard  Company, Palo Alto, CA). Before implementation the STAT was pilot tested with three HCWs and revised based on their feedback.  2.4.1. Work task survey measures  The work task survey focused on physically demanding and hazardous tasks identiÔ¨Åed in previous research (Baron and Habes, 2004; Kim et al., 2010; Meyer and Muntaner, 1999; Myers et al., 1993; WipÔ¨Çi et al., 2012) and was completed throughout each workday during natural breaks in between work tasks (event contingent). The work task survey was accessible at any time dur- ing the day, and participants were instructed to complete it after each work task as possible. If this frequency was not possible, or if the participant forgot to make an entry, they were encouraged to complete the survey at least once every 2 h while at work. Once the work task survey was opened, workers were asked to report the occurrence, duration, and/or frequency of seven categories of home care tasks: driving to/for client, assisting client mobility, bathing/ toileting, dressing, client lifting/transferring, house cleaning, and lifting/moving objects, as well as an ‚Äúother‚Äù category to capture additional tasks. Two of the seven task categories included sub- categories. Assisting client mobility was further speciÔ¨Åed as push- ing or pulling in a wheelchair, or assisting with walking. The objects lifting/moving category was further speciÔ¨Åed by weight of objects handled using intervals from a prior ergonomic self-assessment survey (Wiktorin et al., 1993): light weight (<15 lbs), medium weight (15e35 lbs), and heavy weight (>35 lbs). Example objects of each weight category were provided to help workers make accurate estimations (e.g., light weight object examples were grocery bags or a loaded laundry basket). For each task a worker selected, the STAT presented further questions about the duration of the task in mi- nutes, frequency counts if appropriate, the environmental context  Fig. 1. Home Care STAT: Work task survey screen.  
1160  R. Olson et al.  / Applied Ergonomics 45 (2014) 1157e1166  (e.g., bathing location such as in a shower or a bathtub, client transfer type such as bed to wheelchair/walker), and tools used (e.g., vacuum, long-handled mop). Question branching minimized participant effort by skipping questions about tasks workers did not report completing. See Fig. 1 to view the home screen for the work task survey component of the Home Care STAT.  2.4.2.  Evening survey measures  The evening survey asked workers to rate or record a variety of psychophysical and behavioral variables when cued by a self- selected alarm time set between dinner and bedtime (signal contingent). The evening survey contained daily adaptations of psychophysical and behavioral constructs from the demographics and background survey. Daily adapted measures in the evening survey that were used for analyses in the current study included time working, sleep adequacy (Buxton et al., 2009), morning pain/ discomfort, the Swedish Occupational Fatigue Inventory (Ahsberg, 2000), Perceived Stress (Cohen et al., 1983), Positive/Negative Affect scale (Watson et al., 1988), fruit and vegetable servings, three items about high fat/high sugar foods consumption, and minutes of exercise. In adaptations longer or more complex items were replaced with simpliÔ¨Åed items anchored at the daily time point. For example, musculoskeletal symptoms analyzed were a single item where participants rated their daily level of discomfort/pain upon awakening that morning on a 10-point severity scale. Morning pain was selected instead of evening pain because it was hypothesized that sore muscles or minor strains would be most strongly felt on the following day after an exposure or event. Another example of a daily adaptation was the measure of exercise, where the 4-item iPAQ (Ainsworth et al., 2000) was replaced with a single item asking workers to report daily minutes of moderate exercise, which was deÔ¨Åned as ‚Äúactivity causing harder than normal breathing, such as brisk walking, biking, or sports.‚Äù  2.5. Analysis  2.5.1. Descriptives  To describe the study participants, task exposure levels, and daily symptoms and lifestyle behaviors, we computed means, standard deviations, and frequency distributions from measures in the demographics and background survey and daily STAT measures.  2.5.2.  Reliability  The reliability of workers‚Äô self-monitored STAT data was evalu- ated by comparing researcher and worker measurements during in-home observations. Comparisons included 1) contrasts of mean recorded task durations, 2) computation of percent agreement and kappa coefÔ¨Åcients for dichotomous (yes/no) task occurrences (Cohen, 1960), and 3) computation of agreement Intra-Class Cor- relations (ICCs) for minutes and count measures. For occurrence/ non-occurrence measures, two kappa coefÔ¨Åcients were calcu- lated. The Ô¨Årst evaluated occurrence agreement for all the ques- tions in the work task survey portion of the STAT (all eight task categories plus all branching sub-questions), and the second coef- Ô¨Åcient evaluated only occurrence agreement for the eight main task categories. Due to low occurrence of handling medium and heavy weight objects recorded by both observers and participants, dura- tions for moving light, medium, and heavy objects were collapsed into a single aggregate ‚Äòmoving objects‚Äô variable (for reliability analyses only).  2.5.3. Validity  To evaluate STAT criterion-related validity, we conducted both correlational and multi-level analyses. We implemented correla- tional analyses as a Ô¨Årst step to explore criterion-related validity  and inform more focused multi-level models. Subsequent focused multi-level models were then used to test person-level, day-level, and cross-level predictors of daily outcomes. For correlational an- alyses with daily data we used a recently developed hidden cor- relation technique that corrects for non-observable measurement error due to variations between occasions (i.e., day) in repeated measures (Nguyen and Jiang, 2011). This type of correlation maxi- mizes the use of available data (the formula includes both between and within subject variance), yet captures the correlation among repeated observations within the same subject. Multilevel regres- sion was performed with HLM software (v6.0; Raudenbush et al., 2004) to examine relationships among person- and daily-level factors. Models were designed to evaluate how person-level factors and daily-level work exposures related to daily physical and psy- chological symptoms (fatigue, pain, affect, and stress). Level 1 models tested relationships between daily predictor variables (within-person) and daily outcome variables. All Level 1 predictor variables were person mean-centered and slopes were allowed to vary. Level 2 models tested relationships between person-level predictors (between-person) and daily (within-person) outcome variables. Level 2 predictors were grand mean-centered and treated as Ô¨Åxed effects.  3. Results  3.1. Descriptive results  3.1.1. Demographics and background descriptives  (n ¬º 17 of 23) Most participants regularly performed client lifting or transfer tasks. Tasks causing the most concern for personal injury (10 ¬º highest concern for injury) were objects lifting/moving (M ¬º 3.9, SD ¬º 3.2), housecleaning (M ¬º 3.8, SD ¬º 3.7), and assisting client mobility (i.e., wheelchair, walking; M ¬º 3.4, SD ¬º 2.9). Eighty- six percent of workers reported musculoskeletal symptoms during the past 12 months and Ô¨Åfty-Ô¨Åve percent reported experiencing symptoms during the past seven days. Thirty-four percent reported that symptoms caused them to modify or miss work in the past 12 months. During the same time period workers reported experi- encing an average of 4.0 (SD ¬º 15.3) minor work-related injuries (no .2 (SD ¬º .5) lost work time in- lost work time), and an average of juries. See Table 1 for additional baseline descriptive statistics of psychophysical and lifestyle behavior variables.  3.1.2. Daily STAT descriptives  HCWs contributed 242 participant days of STAT data (157 workdays, 85 non-workdays). Workers had an 85% compliance rate for completing the evening survey (206 completed out of 242 ex- pected). Compliance for the work task survey was not computed because the daily frequency of submissions was free to vary. However, workers submitted work task surveys for only a portion of every workday (average 6.6 h worked reported in evening sur- veys vs. average z2 h total task times recorded). Visual inspection of time stamps for submitted surveys showed on only 6 occasions did a participant submit a work task survey after submitting an evening survey, which suggests that participants generally adhered to the protocol of submitting work task surveys during the day rather than completing them retroactively after being prompted by an alarm to complete an evening survey. No signiÔ¨Åcant relation- ships between demographic variables and number of missing evening surveys were found. Participants recorded the most work time performing house cleaning tasks, followed by bathing/toilet- ing, and dressing (see Table 2). Workers performed an average of 1.5 client lifts or transfers per workday (SD ¬º 3.3). Across the 88 study days when pain was reported, the three most frequent body regions with pain were lower back (66 participant days), shoulders (49

Fruit and vegetable servings and high calorie food/drink consumption were self-reported on a scale of 10 different frequency intervals. We translated interval ratings to daily servings/counts using the following rating system (0 ¬º 0 (Never in the past 4 weeks); 1 ¬º .04 (less than once in the past 4 weeks); 2 ¬º .07 (1e3 times in the past 4 weeks); 3 ¬º .21 (1e2 times a week in the past 4 weeks); 4 ¬º .5 (3e4 times a week in the past 4 weeks); 5 ¬º .79; (5e6 times a week in the past 4 weeks); 6 ¬º 1 (once a day in the past 4 weeks); 7 ¬º 2 (2 times a day in the past 4 weeks); 8 ¬º 3.5 (3e4 times a day in the past 4 weeks); 9 ¬º 5 (5 or more a day in the past 4 weeks). c High calorie food/drink consumption does not translate perfectly into servings per day because of mixed item anchoring (servings vs. meals); instead, the statistic reÔ¨Çects a summed count of instances of consumption of sugary drinks, sugary snacks, and fast food. Exercise questions were asked in the Demographics and Background survey using the 7-item iPAQ scale, but were excluded from analyses in the current paper due to observed measurement errors. Multiple participants provided extreme answers and appeared to misunderstand or make errors on the iPAQ. To illustrate, participants reported an average of 99.0 min (SD ¬º 86.1) of daily physical activity in the Demographics and Background survey (2855 MET-min per week; SD ¬º 3002), compared to only 17.7 min (SD ¬º 20.0) of exercise per day in daily STAT evening surveys.  participant days) and legs/knees (46 participant days). Tasks that most frequently caused workers concern for personal injury were housecleaning (44 participant days), client lifting/transferring (32 participant days), lifting/moving objects (30 participant days), and assisting client mobility (30 participant days). With regard to daily health behaviors, participants reported an average sleep sufÔ¨Åciency rating of 3.7 (1 ¬º no, 5 ¬º yes; SD ¬º 1.4); an average of 17.7 min of exercise (SD ¬º 20.0); and eating an average of 2.9 servings of fruit and vegetables (SD ¬º 2.2), 1.3 servings of sugary snacks (SD ¬º 1.6), 1.3 servings of sugary drinks (SD ¬º 1.9), and 0.3 (SD ¬º 0.6). fast food meals In subsequent correlational analyses sugary snacks/drinks and fast food meals were combined into a single summed ‚Äúhigh calorie food/drink‚Äù measure. Exploratory contrasts between workdays and non-workdays for evening survey items showed that workdays were associated with signiÔ¨Åcantly (t ¬º 2.32, higher fatigue p < .05) and lower positive affect (t ¬º  3.60, p < .01), while non-workdays were associated with higher consumption of high calorie food/drinks (t ¬º  2.60, p < .05).  3.2.  Reliability results  Mean differences between participants and observers in recorded task durations varied from 1.8 to 12.6 min (see Table 3). To illustrate, participants recorded an average of 38.2 min of house cleaning during observation periods, which was 6.1 min more than the average of 32.3 min observed by researchers. In general, participants overestimated task durations relative to researcher measurements, with the exception of the ‚Äòother‚Äô cate- gory where participants recorded an average of 4.3 fewer minutes  Table 2 Reported time allocation and frequency counts for work tasks across all workdays.

Percent agreement for the occurrence of all events in the work task survey (n ¬º 1204 events, according to total occurrences recorded by participants) was 88.7%, while the kappa coefÔ¨Åcient, which cor- rects for chance agreement, was k ¬º .59 (Landis and Koch, 1977). Similarly, percent agreement for the occurrence of the eight main task categories (n ¬º 98 events) was 79.6%, with k ¬º .58. The overall agreement ICC for participants vs. observers in minutes recorded across all tasks was .73. ICCs for agreement for minutes recorded in speciÔ¨Åc tasks are reported in Table 3, but should be interpreted cautiously given the infrequent occurrence of many tasks (and thus, limited data points for comparison). The overall agreement ICCs for participants vs. observers in recording count variables was .46 for the number of transfers performed and .74 for the number of objects moved.  3.3. Validity results  Hidden correlations showed several signiÔ¨Åcant (p < .05) asso- ciations between work exposures and daily symptoms. Time spent driving and dressing a client were positively associated with daily fatigue (r ¬º .44 and .41, respectively), and time spent moving heavy associated with pain the next morning (r ¬º .99).6 objects was Certain work tasks were also associated with various mood and lifestyle behaviors. Daily client transfer count was signiÔ¨Åcantly  6  It is theoretically and empirically established that hidden correlations typically reveal higher and more accurate associations between variables than standard Pearson correlations for repeated measures datasets (Nguyen and Jiang, 2011). Moreover, the Pearson correlation is inappropriate for application with repeated measures datasets due to the dependency of observations within each subject. However, our observed .99 hidden correlation between moving heavy objects and pain is abnormally, and perhaps impossibly, high. In contrast, the Pearson corre- lation between within subject means for these two variables was .50. We therefore inspected and plotted the data for patterns that may have inÔ¨Çated the estimated magnitude of the hidden correlation in this instance. Fourteen of the twenty two subjects recorded zero time moving heavy objects, and Ô¨Åve of those subjects who reported no exposure to moving heavy objects also reported zero ratings of daily pain. The hidden correlation was developed under the assumption of smooth data (e.g., data are normally or uniformly distributed). However, the data in the afore- mentioned variables are sparse due to many missing values and zero-inÔ¨Çation observations. These data patterns appear to be the driving empirical factor behind the abnormally high hidden correlation coefÔ¨Åcient in this case. Therefore, while the hidden correlation is an empirical innovation for detecting signiÔ¨Åcant associations in repeated measures datasets, researchers must inspect data for patterns in variance that may generate biased estimates of association in this paradigm.  
associated with daily fruit and vegetable consumption. Addition- ally, several ‚Äúsymptom‚Äù factors varied together signiÔ¨Åcantly (p < .05); for example, fatigue was associated with increased levels of stress, negative affect, and pain; and positive affect was posi- tively associated with sleep sufÔ¨Åciency. Sleep sufÔ¨Åciency was also signiÔ¨Åcantly related to increased levels of fruit and vegetable consumption (see Table 4). As with all correlation matrices that test a large number of relationships, the probability of type I errors is inÔ¨Çated in our analyses. We did not apply any family-wise cor- rections for signiÔ¨Åcance tests of correlations, such as the false discovery rate correction (Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995, 2000), because they have not yet been adapted for hidden correlations. Moreover, the function of the hidden correlation matrix was to explore the data and inform subsequent construction of multi- level models rather than to draw Ô¨Årm conclusions about associa- tions. All this considered, correlations on their own should be interpreted with caution due to the probability of type I errors in the matrix. Multilevel regression analyses revealed that several STAT daily work task exposure measures were signiÔ¨Åcant predictors of daily outcomes. Time spent dressing the client, lifting/moving medium objects (time), and heavy household objects (count) were predic- tive of higher levels of lagged pain the next morning (see Table 5). In addition, lifting/moving medium (time) or heavy (count) household objects was signiÔ¨Åcantly predictive of daily negative affect. Lifting/moving heavy objects (both time and count)  signiÔ¨Åcantly predicted daily stress. In person-level regression models (Level 2), BMI and age were signiÔ¨Åcant predictors of some daily symptoms (see Table 5). Our examination of cross-level in- teractions between signiÔ¨Åcant work task exposures and person characteristics produced one signiÔ¨Åcant relationship. SpeciÔ¨Åcally, the interaction between increasing person-level BMI and increasing associated with increased levels of daily negative affect (p ¬º .0002). day-level time spent moving medium objects was  4. Discussion  The aim of the current research was to evaluate the Home Care STAT as an ergonomic self-assessment tool for HCWs. We con- ducted a daily diary study with the STAT to: 1) measure daily task exposures in a sample of HCWs, 2) evaluate the reliability of the STAT by comparing worker self-assessments to researcher ob- servations, and 3) evaluate the criterion-related validity of the STAT through correlational and multi-level analyses. Results conÔ¨Årm that HCWs are a population in need of health and safety interventions, and that the STAT is an acceptably reliable and valid tool for safety self-assessment in home care.  4.1.  Strengths and limitations  Strengths of the current study include the use of an empirically developed safety self-assessment tool; daily self-report measures  Table 3 A contrast of worker and researcher recordings of task exposures in minutes during in-home observations.

All level 1 variables were group-mean centred and all level 2 variables were grand-mean centred. Degrees of freedom varied from 20 to 22 across all models. Only those work task exposure variables that yielded signiÔ¨Åcant relationships are reported (time spent assisting clients walking, bathing/toileting, client lifting/transferring, and house cleaning as well as the number of client lifts/transfers and light objects moving were all nonsigniÔ¨Åcant predictors of outcome variables). BMI and age were selected due to strong correlations with outcome variables. p < .10, *p < .05, **p < .01, ***p < .001. a Outcome variable was lagged in models.  y  that were digitally time stamped; in-home observations to esti- mate the reliability of worker self-assessments; and the use of new correlational techniques to evaluate work task exposures as pre- dictors of daily outcomes. In addition, the study design allowed for multi-level modeling of relationships between person character- istics, work exposures, and evening symptoms. We also measured lifestyle behaviors, which allowed us to explore correlations be- tween safety and health factors. Limitations of the project suggest opportunities for future research and practice, and include the somewhat small conve- nience sample, omission of one-time survey measures of task ex- posures, timing of the daily pain measure, a lack of inter-rater reliability assessment between research observers, potential participant reactivity to research observers, and a variety of biases inherent to self-reported data. These several limitations and their potential implications are discussed below. With regard to the nature and size of our sample, a convenience sample like ours means that participants may not have been representative of the population at large, and thus Ô¨Åndings may not generalize to other HCWs more broadly. As for sample size, sta- tistical modeling demonstrates that multi-level studies should produce increasingly accurate estimates of between and within person variances as the number of level 2 observations approach 30 In this light, our sample size of 23 participants  10 (Hox, 2010). days (for a total of 242 participant days) was sufÔ¨Åcient for pro- ducing reasonably precise estimates of these variance components. With regard to our ability to detect effects, multi-level power analysis, and power analysis for hidden correlations, are both developing areas. Most multi-level power calculators are tailored to experimental rather than descriptive designs like ours, and the exploratory nature of our study meant that we did not possess a priori effect size estimates for relationships tested in our models. In sum, we did not design the study based on power for exploratory tests of STAT validity, but instead, designed it to produce reasonable estimates of variance components in task exposures and evening symptoms among HCWs. Limitations related to sample size and selection method may be addressed through future replication studies and/or through random selection of study participants from all available members of a sub-population. Measurement limitations may also be addressed in future research. It was a limitation that the study did not include a global one-time survey self-assessment of daily work task exposures that could be compared to parallel daily exposure measures collected  with the STAT. It would be valuable for future researchers to contrast the accuracy of both types of self-reported task exposures so that the added value of EMA methods can be determined. Also, we may have observed larger or different effects of exposures on pain if we had analyzed post-shift instead of morning pain. In past studies pain is lower and less variable in the morning compared to right after the end of a shift (See Amick et al., 2003). As in similar studies of worker self-assessments (e.g., Unge et al., 2005), for practical reasons we did not evaluate inter-rater reliability between researcher observers, which means that the degree of calibration among researcher observers is unknown. Observations were con- ducted in client‚Äôs private homes, and we opted to send only a single research observer to maximize client acceptance of observations, and also to minimize crowding and obstructed views inside small rooms (e.g., bathrooms). However, future research would be enhanced by the inclusion of inter-rater reliability assessments among researcher observers during training and/or in the Ô¨Åeld. While in-home observations were a strong point of the study, participants may have reacted to researcher presence by tempo- rarily increasing the accuracy of their self-monitoring, or by per- forming different work tasks than normal. While Olson et al. (2009) demonstrated that truck drivers‚Äô behavior was not reactive to the onset of a self-monitoring procedure during video camera obser- vations, an in-person observation is more intrusive than a camera. If participants were reactive, this may have resulted in inÔ¨Çated reliability estimates for the STAT, or in workers performing un- representative work on those study days. While the 10e14 day sample period protects against the problem of unrepresentative descriptive STAT results, future studies could protect further against inÔ¨Çated reliability by increasing the number of researcher obser- vation days per participant to allow for habituation to the procedure.  4.2. Discussion of descriptive Ô¨Åndings  Descriptive Ô¨Åndings from both retrospective surveys and daily STAT measures of exposures were generally aligned with existing evidence that HCWs are a population in need of health and safety interventions. Our small convenience sample was predominantly female, obese, had a high prevalence of musculoskeletal symptoms, and reported low levels of fruit and vegetable consumption. With regard to task exposures and physical symptoms, housekeeping consumed about 40% of caregivers‚Äô self-reported work task time.  
1164  R. Olson et al.  / Applied Ergonomics 45 (2014) 1157e1166  Given the signiÔ¨Åcant time spent housekeeping, interventions to reduce ergonomic demands and awkward postures during house- keeping could generate meaningful reductions in musculoskeletal symptoms for HCWs. However, exposures to less frequent but more physically demanding tasks remain important. For example, in the current study manual handling of household objects was associated with daily pain, and in other studies manual handling of objects and assisting client mobility were associated with lost time injuries (Baron and Habes, 2004; Kim et al., 2010; Meyer and Muntaner, 1999; Myers et al., 1993; WipÔ¨Çi et al., 2012). With regard to di- etary Ô¨Åndings, low fruit and vegetable consumption is associated with increased risk of stroke, heart disease, cancer, and mortality (Hung et al., 2004; Neuhouser et al., 2003). However, we note that our fruit and vegetable measure was a single question created for the current study, and may not provide an estimate as valid as those produced by more sophisticated measures (e.g., Thompson et al., 2002).  4.3. Discussion of reliability Ô¨Åndings  In our analyses of in-home observations, kappa coefÔ¨Åcients for occurrence/non-occurrence of events between workers‚Äô and ob- servers‚Äô measurements approached .60, which exceeds traditional standards for acceptable reliability (acceptable kappa coefÔ¨Åcient k > .40; Landis and Koch, 1977). And, agreement ICCs for task exposure minutes and counts exceeded .70. Mean differences in minutes between workers‚Äô and observers‚Äô recordings varied in absolute value from 1.8 to 12.6 min. For surveillance purposes, these mean differences seem tolerable for producing actionable assessments of HCWs task exposures. Moreover, these mean dif- ferences are comparable to previous diary style ergonomic self- assessment data collected with nurses and ofÔ¨Åce workers (Unge et al., 2005). These Ô¨Åndings suggest that, when participant and observer data are pooled and contrasted at the sample level, the STAT is moderately reliable for measuring HCWs‚Äô task exposures. While STAT reliability during in-home observations was acceptable, variance in reliability across measures may inform future research and practice. In general, workers overestimated task durations, but this tendency was magniÔ¨Åed for the potentially unpleasant task of bathing and toileting. This elevated discrepancy was partly explained by one worker who recorded bathing and toileting time when the researcher observer recorded no bathing and toileting time, which likely occurred prior to the researcher‚Äôs arrival, but was recorded by the worker during the in-home observation. Alternatively, the researcher may have missed the occurrence of the task. However, the overestimation of time spent performing physically demanding tasks such as bathing/toileting and dressing clients is consistent with systematic bias observed in prior research (e.g., Barrero et al., 2009b). Such biases could result in overestimation of task exposures in physically demanding tasks. Also, if the magnitude of a certain bias varied greatly across workers, then this error variance might reduce statistical power for detecting actual cross-level associations between worker charac- teristics and daily level exposureesymptom associations. Testing for biases such as these in the future is important because ergo- nomic self-assessment inherently focuses on physically demanding work. A simple method that may attenuate such bias would be to build timers into computerized tools, or provide workers with a manual timer rather than having them rely on clocks for self- monitoring. A variety of off-the-shelf time tracking applications for smart phones could be used to measure time-based exposures (e.g., Time Tracker Pro application for iPhone/iPod Touch). While the current study did not explicitly test whether STAT measures of work task exposures were more accurate or repre- sentative than a one-time worker self-assessment survey, we  expect that EMA methods like the STAT would help workers pro- duce more accurate information because self-recordings occur in close temporal proximity to the events being assessed. This logical probability and the initial reliability of the STAT should encourage researchers and practitioners to use the STAT to measure task ex- posures among HCWs. Daily process measurement methods also open the door for studying more complex and multi-level re- lationships between worker characteristics, daily work tasks, physical and psychological states, and health behaviors.  4.4. Discussion of validity Ô¨Åndings  Hidden correlations and multi-level models showed that several task exposures measured by the STAT had signiÔ¨Åcant associations with daily pain, including driving time, dressing time, and moving objects. If our assumption that daily pain is a risk factor for long-term injury and disability is correct, these Ô¨Åndings support the STAT as a valid ergonomic exposure assessment tool. In support of this assumption, the tasks associated with daily symptoms in the current study have also been associated with workers‚Äô concern for injury and lost time injuries in previous research (Baron and Habes, 2004; WipÔ¨Çi et al., 2012). In addition to effects of work task exposures on daily symptoms, person-level factors of BMI and age were associated with daily symptoms. We also observed one signiÔ¨Åcant cross-level inter- action between BMI and the daily-level association between moving medium objects and negative affect. These Ô¨Åndings suggest that some person-level factors may make HCWs more susceptible to certain safety and health hazards. Our analyses also identiÔ¨Åed associations between daily symptoms and lifestyle behaviors. For example, in multi-level models measures of manual material handling signiÔ¨Å- cantly increased daily negative affect and stress. In hidden correla- tions, these symptom variables (negative affect, stress) were also signiÔ¨Åcantly associated with high calorie food/drinks. These Ô¨Åndings suggest that home care task exposures may generate physical or psychological symptoms that have indirect negative effects on healthful behaviors. Taken together, these Ô¨Åndings suggest that the STAT measures task exposures that are related to Total Worker Health√î (the integration of injury prevention with health promotion; NIOSH, 2012).  4.5. Discussion of the usability and future dissemination of the STAT  The Home Care STAT, and other hand-held computer apps used for worker self-assessments, will be most likely to be adopted and have an impact in the home care industry if they are easy to use. On this theme, most workers reported few problems using the device, and found the touch screen survey interface to be very user friendly. The version of the STAT used in the current study was programmed with SurveyToGo software, which can be purchased off the shelf and has a great visual interface for programming logic for a large array of question types. However, the software is actually designed to be used by researchers to collect data via interviews. This means that a login is required when the app is launched, and if a participant accidentally logs themselves out, they have to enter a username and password provided by researchers. We also found the data export to be problematic for questions where a user could select multiple options. Rather than reserving a unique column for each possible answer, the software only created a data column for items selected. This meant that each exported dataset had to be manipulated extensively before data analysis. So, the application was easy to program and easy for workers to use (unless they logged themselves out), but it did require a high level of expertise to analyze exported data. Future versions of the software, or alternative smart phone applications, may enhance the STAT for dissemination and impact in the home care industry.

Background surveys and workers‚Äô self- assessments conÔ¨Årm that HCWs are a priority population for er- gonomic assessment and intervention research. The predominantly female sample was older, obese, experienced a high prevalence of musculoskeletal symptoms, and reported regularly performing dangerous and demanding tasks such as client transfers. In-home observations demonstrated that workers produced moderately reliable self-assessments of both task occurrence and duration us- ing the STAT. The daily diary design and an evening symptom survey showed that exposures to tasks such as dressing clients and moving/lifting household objects were related to daily levels of pain, occupational fatigue, negative affect, and stress. We also observed signiÔ¨Åcant hidden correlations between postulated out- comes of negative affect and stress with health factors, suggesting that work exposures in home care may have indirect effects on worker health behaviors. Limitations in the current study suggest areas for future research and practice, such as providing workers with devices with built-in timers to enhance the completeness and reliability of self-assessments. Altogether, our Ô¨Åndings support the STAT as a reliable and valid exposure assessment tool for HCWs that researchers and practitioners are encouraged to use to measure HCWs‚Äô task exposures, evaluate risk, and guide intervention selection.

s000368701400026x,"  Interruptions, a common occurrence in modern workplaces, have been shown to have a wide variety of negative consequences (e.g., Jett and George, 2003). They can result in slower task completion time, increased error rates and additional job stress (e.g., Bailey and Konstan, 2006; Cellier and Eyrolle, 1992; Czerwinski et al., 2000; Van Bergen, 1968). Disruption of work in team-based activities can also lead to coordination problems, including increased time pressure and team member workload (Jett and George, 2003; Reder and Schwab, 1990). Interruptions can have particularly negative effects on personnel working in time-critical environments, such as command and control (C2) settings, as an interruption occurring in these high-risk, information-rich settings may cause personnel to miss critical information directly related to the decision-at-hand. Supervisors in modern work environments are particularly prone to interruptions in the form of ‚Äúunexpected meetings and conversations‚Äù (Jett and George, 2003, p. 494) that interfere with their ongoing tasks (e.g., Mintzberg, 1990). In particular, supervisors in time-critical environments may be  * Corresponding author.

For example in C2 settings, supervisors not only monitor the mission and make decisions that involve tactical assessment, but are also in charge of monitoring the per- formance of other personnel. Detecting changes and maintaining situation awareness (SA) of an ongoing mission after an interrup- tion in such complex monitoring tasks often imposes a high working memory load and requires mental calculation (Trafton et al., 2003). To date, however, little research has focused on interruption recovery support for supervisors in C2 settings. Providing such support may help supervisors more effectively resume their previous tasks, which often involves understanding the team‚Äôs ‚Äúmission picture‚Äù (or ‚Äúbig picture‚Äù), which may conse- quently beneÔ¨Åt overall team functioning. Previous research has investigated operator-level interruption recovery in C2 settings (e.g., Scott et al., 2006; St. John et al., 2005), with a particular focus in assisting operators to ‚Äúcatch up‚Äù on changes that occurred in their dynamic task environment while they were attending to an interruption. This research builds on this approach by adapting operator-level interruption recovery methods to account for the informational needs of team supervi- sors in C2 environments. In particular, this research builds on Scott et al.‚Äôs (2006) use of interactive event timelines coupled with discrete event replay to enable unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) operators to regain SA after interruptions. In that research, select- ing an iconic event bookmark from an interactive event timeline  
F. Sasangohar et al.  / Applied Ergonomics 45 (2014) 1148e1156  1149  caused the historical state of the tactical map to be displayed at the time of the event in a separate replay window. This paper extends that previous research by providing an interactive event timeline that highlights team-related events and activities to improve su- pervisor decision accuracy and timeliness after an interruption. To further set the context for this work, the paper overviews previous research in the area of time-critical interruption recovery. Next, a representative mission task scenario and experimental platform developed to evaluate the supervisory-level interactive event timeline design concept are introduced, along with the interruption recovery assistance (IRA) tool that reiÔ¨Åed the inter- active event timeline interruption recovery method. A laboratory- based user study is then described that aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of this interruption recovery method on mitigating supervisory-level interruption recovery. Finally, the results of the experiment are detailed and discussed.  2. Background  Over the past decade, there has been a growing interest in un- derstanding the perceptual and cognitive processes involved in regaining the SA after an interruption in dynamic monitoring tasks. In this section, the work of Trafton et al. (2003) to anatomize the interruption process is Ô¨Årst discussed. Next, a framework relevant to interruption recovery called Memory for Goal (MFG) model and two interruption recovery techniques, namely the use of external cues and event review, are reviewed.  2.1. Anatomy of  interruptions  Based on a task analysis of different interruption scenarios, Trafton et al. (2003) developed a model to describe the interruption and resumption process. Their model focuses on the temporal process of someone performing a ‚Äúprimary task‚Äù, becoming aware of an interruption (i.e., the interruption alert), beginning the ‚Äúsec- ondary task‚Äù (i.e., the interruption task), ending the secondary task, and Ô¨Ånally, resuming the primary task. The model deÔ¨Ånes the period of time between the interruption alert and beginning the secondary task as ‚Äúinterruption lag.‚Äù The period of time between ending the secondary task and resuming the primary task is deÔ¨Åned as the ‚Äúresumption lag‚Äù (also referred to as reorientation time (Gillie and Broadbent, 1989) or interruption recovery time (Scott et al., 2006)). Trafton et al.‚Äôs research showed that when given an opportunity, people tend to use the interruption lag (e.g., of 8 s in their study), to mentally prepare for the interruption, which in turn, helps to reduce their resumption lag compared to when no interruption lag is provided. Other researchers explain this phenomenon as creating a prospective memory (PM) task in which the interruptee encodes an adequate intention to resume the primary task before orienting to the interruption task (Dodhia and Dismukes, 2009). This model was later expanded by Boehm-Davis and Remington (2009) who further divided the resumption lag into the time to disengage from the interruption task, the time to re-orient to the primary task, and the time to resume the primary task. Re-orienting to the primary task may be problematic since it involves not only a visual re-acquisition, but also memory for important state information (Boehm-Davis and Remington, 2009).  2.2. Memory for Goal (MFG) model  Altmann and Trafton (2002, 2004) proposed a cognitive process model of task resumption in which memory elements of the sus- pended goals are activated. According to this model, activation of memory elements is subject to decay over time. Therefore, old goals need to undergo a priming process using associative links between  the goal and internal (e.g., steps in a procedural task) or external (e.g., environmental) retrieval cues. In subsequent work, Altmann and Trafton (2004) explained how mental preparation, especially via the use of mental or environmental cues during the interruption lag can help an interruptee resume a primary task as predicted by goal-activation theory. In several experiments (Altmann and Trafton, 2004; Trafton et al., 2005), they demonstrated how this theory can predict why providing explicit environmental cues, such as eye-ball icons or very salient arrows that mark the place of someone‚Äôs recent actions, in a computer interface helps to reduce people‚Äôs resumption lag following an interruption. An important assumption that underlies this ‚Äúpreparatory‚Äù mitigation technique is that the primary task environment (e.g., computer interface) has not changed while the interruptee is per- forming the interruption task. However, in many complex task environments, such as command and control, task environments tend to be more dynamic where important situational changes occur in the primary task environment when someone is attending to an interruption. St. John and Smallman (2008) used the MFG model to develop an integrated framework to describe the post- interruption SA recovery in dynamic tasks. According to this framework, during recovery one needs to re-orient to the primary task in order to detect changes in the environment. This additional re-orientation stage (i.e., inferring the situational changes) is cognitively taxing since the interruption degrades the memory of the situation before interruption.  2.3.  Change blindness  An important cognitive phenomenon that must be considered when investigating interruption recovery in such environments is change blindness. This phenomenon refers to the fact that people often fail to detect changes within a visual scene, especially when returning to the scene. Supervisory-level command and control tasks are complex monitoring tasks and hence are especially prone to change blindness since detecting mission changes is essential for gaining situation awareness. Previous research shows that in- terruptions, even for a short time (e.g., screen Ô¨Çickers), may cause the observer to fail to detect substantial changes in the scene or display (e.g., DiVita et al., 2004; Rensink, 2002; Simons and Ambinder, 2005). Simply looking away from a computer screen can also lead to change blindness (e.g., Durlach, 2004; Rensink et al., 1997). In time-critical command and control, many in- terruptions require a supervisor‚Äôs visual attention, which in turn can lead to change blindness phenomenon. One approach to mitigating interruptions in a dynamic task environment prone to change blindness is to use contextual cues to help someone regain their previous context and learn what infor- mation they have missed during an interruption. Daniels et al. (2002) implemented an interruption recovery tool using a spoken dialogue interface to mitigate the negative effects of interrupting a military operator while they were performing two monitoring tasks, tracking military logistics requests from deployed ground troops and monitoring their ship‚Äôs system status. Using verbal queries, operators could ask simple questions regarding the inter- rupted task such as their status before the interruption (e.g., ‚Äúwhere was I?‚Äù, ‚Äúwhat was I last working on?‚Äù (Daniels et al., 2002, p. 16)), or request more complex information, such as an audio summary of the task progress since the beginning of the interruption.  2.4.  Event review  The majority of the interruption recovery research in dynamic environments has focused on similar ‚Äúevent review‚Äù concepts. St. John et al. (2005) investigated a textual event history log called  
1150  F. Sasangohar et al.  / Applied Ergonomics 45 (2014) 1148e1156  Fig. 1. Command center laboratory setting.  CHEX (Change History Explicit) that provided situation awareness of the important mission changes using a table of event bookmarks. When comparing the CHEX approach with video replay of historical mission events during a military airspace-monitoring task, they found that interruption recovery using the CHEX textual event history log was more effective and faster than video replay. While their video replay condition, which provided straight-forward ‚Äúre- wind‚Äù and ‚Äúreplay‚Äù functionality akin to ‚Äúinstant replay‚Äù during a sports game, did not prove to be valuable, Scott et al. (2006) have argued that replay supplemented by event highlighting might be more effective. To investigate this hypothesis, Scott et al. (2006) investigated alternative event replay designs to assist interruption recovery during a task involving a single operator monitoring a multiple unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) mission. Their study compared a no assistance condition against discrete and continuous forms of event replay (available on a peripheral monitor). In the discrete replay condition, selecting an iconic event bookmark from an interactive event timeline located on the replay screen caused the replay window to display the state of the tactical map when the event occurred. In the continuous replay condition, an accelerated (w10 real-time speed) historical view of all changes to the tactical map within a selected timeframe was displayed. In both replay condi- tions, event highlighting on an interactive event timeline located below the replay window was provided. Results from this study showed that the discrete event replay helped to reduce interrup- tion recovery time, but only after complex mission changes. This warrants further investigation of tools to mitigate the disadvan- tages of interruptions when only simple system changes have occurred. In addition, the study results might indicate that task scenarios were overly simplistic and the interruptions likely too short to produce signiÔ¨Åcant differences in interruption recovery or overall task performance. This paper investigates the effects of an improved highlighting tool to help supervisors of multiple UAV operators during a more dynamic, and more challenging command and control task, and a more realistic simulation environment.  3.  Experimental platform and task scenarios  To facilitate laboratory-based testing of interruption recovery interface concepts, a representative task scenario was Ô¨Årst devel- oped to provide a foundation for emulating a dynamic command and control team task. The task scenario is based on a UAV ground force protection mission, where a UAV operations team is tasked with ensuring the safe passage of an important political convoy through a hostile region. The team consists of three operators  controlling multiple semi-autonomous UAVs and a mission com- mander. Each operator in the UAV operations team is responsible for discovering potential threats to the convoy in their assigned area of interest (AOI) by monitoring the surveillance progress of three UAVs. The mission commander (i.e., the supervisor) is responsible for the safe passage of the convoy by overseeing the operators‚Äô prog- ress and resolving issues related to underperformance of UAVs or operators by commanding time-critical decisions such as holding/ releasing the convoy at its current position, reassigning UAVs be- tween operators, and requesting assistance from external intelli- gence sources. Finally, the mission commander can reroute the convoy along an alternative path if the main path becomes too dangerous. To emulate the above task scenario in a laboratory setting, a representative command and control room was created (Fig. 1), along with a software platform for simulating mission events and displaying mission data. For the experiment, the UAVs and UAV operators were simulated. The physical environment provided (1024  768 three 42-inch pixels), wall-mounted Smartboard interactive plasma displays to act as primary mission displays and to provide a variety of mission-related information to the mission commander. The environment also provided a mobile 12.1-inch Wacom Cintiq tablet display that enabled the mission comman- der to input command decisions into the system. A Dell Optiplex GX500 server computer, located just outside the experimental room, was used to drive the simulated task environment. The software platform provided three command-level interfaces for the large screen displays: a Map Display (MD), a Mission Status Display (MSD), and a Remote Assistance Display (RAD) (Figs. 2e3). The Map Display contains the geospatial map of the mission‚Äôs area of interests (AOI) as well as a threat summary and strike schedule timeline that reveals important information about the known and potential threats to the safety of the convoy (Fig. 2 (left)). The Mission Status Display (MSD) provides an overview of the current and expected operators‚Äô performance as well as several other mission status updates (Fig. 2 (right)). The MSD contains four main components: operator performance diagrams, tasking infor- mation for each operator, communication link status diagram, and a timestamp history log of important system events. The Remote Assistance Display (RAD) allows the mission commander to request status updates from the operators and to help them identify targets (Fig. 3 (left), for a complete description of the platform and task see Sasangohar (2009)). The software platform also provided a tablet display interface: the Mission Commander Interface (MCI) (Fig. 3 (right)), which  
F. Sasangohar et al.  / Applied Ergonomics 45 (2014) 1148e1156  1151  Fig. 2.  Left: map display (MD); right: mission status display (MSD).  enabled the mission commander to implement command decision within the simulation environment, and into which features of the developed interruption recovery tool were integrated, as described below.  4.  Interruption recovery assistance (IRA) design  To derive information and functional requirements aimed at supporting interruption recovery in the UAV team supervision environment, along with more general requirements for support- ing the mission commander in the UAV team task scenario, a hybrid cognitive task analysis (hCTA) (Nehme et al., 2006) was conducted. Several important requirements emerged from this analysis related to supporting interruption recovery, mainly, providing visual in- formation on how close the convoy is to a threat, displaying when and where a UAV was destroyed, highlighting an operator‚Äôs per- formance if it is deteriorating, and highlighting any recent changes in communication status (for full details of the analysis, see Wan et al. (2007)). As discussed previously, one technique to display past events is to use an animated replay feature (St. John et al., 2005). However, such sequential replay of events may increase resumption lag since time may be wasted watching irrelevant events. Instead, Scott et al.  (2006) used discrete event replay driven by an interactive event timeline that provided a visual summary of past critical events. Their research showed that although this approach can positively affect decision-making and interruption recovery in UAV opera- tions, including redundant and irrelevant visual information in the visual summary shown on the event timeline can negatively affect performance. They also found that locating the event replay tool on a peripheral display can hinder the ability to properly relate past events with the current system state, and hence recommended that the event history be integrated with the current system state. Based on the requirements generated in H-CTA and the above- mentioned design recommendations an interruption recovery assistance (IRA) tool was developed that contains two main com- ponents, 1) an interactive event timeline, and 2) discrete event highlighting capabilities. The interactive event timeline was incorporated into the MCI (Fig. 3), while the event highlighting occurred on the MD (Fig. 2), atop the situation map. The IRA timeline (Fig. 4 (top)), contained four event rows, each displaying interactive event ‚Äúbookmarks‚Äù for different types of critical mission events: convoy attacks, UAVs destroyed, late strikes (i.e., threats that are scheduled to get destroyed after the convoy enters their weapon range), and communication link status changes. Except for communication link status, selecting a bookmark on the IRA  Fig. 3.  Left: remote assistance display (RAD); Right: tablet interface: mission commander interface (MCI).

For example, if a ‚Äúconvoy attack‚Äù bookmark is selected, the location of the attack would be highlighted with a red ‚ÄúX‚Äù on the Map Display for 5 s, and then fades away (Fig. 4 (bottom)). The timeline provided a dynamically updated view of the events that occurred within the last 10 min (or will occur in the next 5 min, in the case of late strike notiÔ¨Åcations). This time scale was chosen to suit the experimental sessions, which lasted about 20e25 min. In practice, a different time scale would likely be needed for the actual task operations, depending on the operation tempo and complexity. A preliminary study of the IRA tool showed minimal usage of the tool and increased recovery time after simple changes had occurred, but also showed a positive trend for decision accuracy effects (Scott et al., 2008). Participant interviews and general ob- servations suggested that these results were, at least in part, due to the task and experimental design. In particular, overly simplistic task scenarios did not create a realistic and sufÔ¨Åciently challenging time-critical decision-making environment. Moreover, the experi- mental interruptions may have been too short and overly simplistic, and thus, not sufÔ¨Åciently distracting to require assis- tance to regain situation awareness once participants returned to the primary task. These Ô¨Åndings motivated us to reÔ¨Åne the  experimental design (described in the following section) and task scenarios (described previously) to provide a more realistic envi- ronment for testing the utility of discrete highlighting and the associated interactive event timeline in the IRA tool.  5. Method  The study focused on determining the IRA tool‚Äôs effect on re- covery time and decision accuracy of participants who played the role of team supervisor in the experimental task environment described above.  5.1.  Participants  Twenty-four computer-literate participants (18 male, 6 female), ranging from 18 to 58 years old, were recruited from the local university community. Twelve participants were students with previous military training who were either enrolled in Reserve OfÔ¨Åcers‚Äô Training Corps (ROTC) program or graduated from military academies. Of the twelve remaining participants, nine were either undergraduate or graduate students. Participants received $30 remuneration and the best performer received $100. The convoy‚Äôs health score and mission completion time was used to assess performance.

Tasks  The main part of the experiment was conducted in the experi- mental platform previously described. The secondary (interrup- tion) task was performed on a computer located in an adjacent room.  5.2.1.  Primary task  Participants assumed the role of the team‚Äôs mission commander in the UAV ground force protection mission scenario previously described. Participants had to be vigilant of changes in the scenario, assist the simulated remote operators using the RAD display, and to command decisions to mitigate situations in which operators were underperforming or other mission goals were not on track.  5.2.2.  Interruption task  At two predetermined times during the study (Table 1), the experimenter would interrupt the participants and ask them to leave the room to perform the secondary task. The exact timing of the interruptions was determined by the location of convoy and the timing of pre-planned events. Scenarios were designed in such a manner that immediately before the interruptions ended, several pre-planned events occurred (e.g., convoy was attacked, convoy was about to enter an unsurveilled area, UAVs destroyed, etc.). These events required a participant‚Äôs immediate attention upon their return to the primary task. The goal of the secondary task was to Ô¨Ånd a series of locations on a digital world map using provided hints. The Place Spotting application1 was used, which is an open- source online application based on Google Maps platform. Each interruption took 2 min, deliberately longer than the 1-min inter- ruption task used in the preliminary study to minimize opportu- nities for participants to rely on memory during the recovery period. This reliance on memory was reported as a main inter- ruption recovery strategy in the preliminary study. A further step was taken to distract participants: the experi- menter also asked several questions during the secondary task. For example, the participants were asked: ‚ÄúDid you Ô¨Ånd the hint?‚Äù or ‚ÄúHow many tasks did you complete successfully?‚Äù Additional, to further motivate participant engagement in the task, they were told that performance in the secondary task would count toward their performance calculation to win the prize for best performance.  5.3. Design  A 2 (assistance type)  2 (decision difÔ¨Åculty) repeated measures experimental design was used. The two assistance types were assistance and no assistance. In the assistance condition, partici- pants were provided with the IRA tool. In the no assistance con- dition, participants performed the experimental task without the IRA tool (using an alternate version of the MCI that did not include the interactive timeline). Decision difÔ¨Åculty conditions were simple and complex. In the simple condition, there was only one possible decision that could address the situation facing the mission commander following an  1 http://www.placespotting.com.  interruption. For example, the convoy is approaching a target that will not be destroyed in time, so the only correct decision is to hold the convoy until the strike team clears the target. In the complex condition, several decisions could be made to address the situation; however, only one decision properly fulÔ¨Ålled all mission objectives. An example of a complex decision is that while the mission commander was gone, one of the UAVs was destroyed and the convoy is approaching the weapons range of an unsurveilled area, putting it in a potential threat situation. Also, during the inter- ruption, the JSTARS communication link was disconnected (and thus additional surveillance information is unavailable). Therefore, when the mission commander returns from the interruption, they must observe that (a) the convoy is approaching a potential threat region and (b) they cannot use JSTARS to obtain surveillance in- formation about the unsurveilled area. Although the mission commander could chose to wait until the JSTARS communication link comes back online, the optimal decision would be to quickly reassign another UAV to the area, and to hold the convoy until the potential threat region is surveilled. In general, a complex decision requires the mission commander to choose an optimal strategy from a few that are acceptable. The two main dependent variables were interruption recovery time and decision accuracy. Interruption recovery time refers to the time between a participant returning to the primary task after the interruption and he or she making the Ô¨Årst decision (correct or incorrect) to address the post-interruption situation (described by Trafton et al. (2005) as resumption lag). Decision accuracy refers to the correctness of a decision made following an interruption. The following nominal score was assigned to the action taken after each interruption: 0 No action taken2 or incorrect decision; 1 ¬º Correct decision.  ¬º  5.4.  Procedure  Participants were Ô¨Årst welcomed and asked to complete an informed consent form and a demographics questionnaire. Next, they completed a computer-based PowerPoint√í tutorial that out- lined the experimental tasks and explained the software interfaces. The participants then completed two practice sessions in the experimental task environment. In the Ô¨Årst practice session, par- ticipants were asked to observe changes of a partial scenario. Important functionalities of the interfaces were explained and the participants were asked questions to check their comprehension. This session took approximately 15 min. The second practice ses- sion was a complete task scenario in which the participant had to perform the task without the experimenter‚Äôs aid. In this session, the participant was interrupted once in order to complete the sec- ondary task. The training module was customized (i.e., either included IRA or not) based on the condition assigned to the participant. A benchmark test was used to ensure a sufÔ¨Åcient level of task competency had been reached, which included the number of targets found or the number of operator status updates reques- ted. Total training took approximately 60 min. The two test scenarios were counterbalanced and assigned randomly to participants. These scenarios included two in- terruptions each after which participants had to make either a simple (after the Ô¨Årst interruption) or a complex (after the second interruption) decision. The test scenarios took 20e25 min each to complete with a 5-min break after the Ô¨Årst trial. Another set of training (15 min) was provided between the two trials to prepare  2 While in practice, no action taken may represent a ‚Äúcorrect‚Äù decision following an interruption, in the study, an action was always required to address an emerging situation following all of the experimental interruptions.

After the experiment, participants took part in a retrospective post-experiment interview to gather feedback about the interfaces and the task scenario. This involved the experimenter walking them through their post-interruption decisions while watching corresponding video replay of the experimental interfaces (interface capture was performed using Camtasia√í real-time screen capture software during the study sessions). The study trials and interviews were videotaped for further analysis. The entire experiment lasted approximately 150 min per participant.  6. Results and discussion  To test the effect of the IRA tool on interruption recovery time, a 2  2 repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) comparing assistance type and decision difÔ¨Åculty, blocking for military expe- rience was conducted. The ANOVA results showed that participants vided assistance (M ¬º 9.77 s, SD ¬º 4.65 s) than when no assistance were signiÔ¨Åcantly faster in their interruption recovery when pro- was provided (M ¬º 28.04 s, SD ¬º 16.51 s), (F(1,22) ¬º 64.43, p < 0.001). However, recovery times were not signiÔ¨Åcantly different after simple (M ¬º 10.17 s, SD ¬º 4.49 s) or complex (M ¬º 9.38 s, SD ¬º 4.86 s) decisions (F(1,22) ¬º 1.50, p ¬º 0.234). No interaction effects were found (F(1,22) ¬º 0.14, p ¬º 0.709). On average, recovery times for non-military participants and military participants were comparable (non-military: M ¬º 19.06 s, SD ¬º 12.00 s; military: M ¬º 18.75 s, SD ¬º 15.62 s, Fig. 5). With respect to decision accuracy, the effect of the IRA tool on simple and complex decisions was tested separately. McNemar‚Äôs test with the continuity correction showed a signiÔ¨Åcant difference  between decision accuracy for simple decisions across assistance types (Chi squared ¬º 4.167, p ¬º 0.04) (Table 2). The same test also showed a signiÔ¨Åcant difference between complex decisions accu- squared ¬º 5.786, p ¬º 0.016) racy across assistance types (Chi (Table 3). The results show that the interruption recovery tool led to signiÔ¨Åcantly improved decision accuracy for both decision types but was more effective for complex decisions. A video analysis was performed on the post-experimental in- terviews and the observation notes were reviewed for important events. These analyses revealed further information about the utility of the interruption recovery tool and of participants‚Äô usage behavior. The analyses revealed that all 24 participants took advantage of the interruption recovery assistance when provided and that the majority of participants (19 of 24) used the high- lighting feature. In general, after an interruption happened, par- ticipants faced a challenging situation (e.g., convoy under attack or about to enter an unsurveilled region) and, thus, participants had to make a quick decision to mitigate the risk to the convoy. The interview analysis revealed that participants realized that the time it took to navigate the main displays for information might have dire consequences to the convoy‚Äôs health and hence gathered temporal information from the IRA tool (e.g., to identify the location of destroyed UAVs or the history of convoy attacks, their duration and location). In addition, 12 participants reported using the IRA tool throughout the session, not just after the interruptions. Thus, the IRA tool appeared to also provide more general situation awareness support during normal mission operations. Out of the four interactive event bookmarks, ‚Äúconvoy attacked‚Äù was used the most after the interruption to determine the attack locations on the situation map. The post-experimental interview revealed that the majority of participants found the convoy health information most valuable after the interruptions and hence other  Table 2 McNemar contingency table for simple situations.

F. Sasangohar et al.  / Applied Ergonomics 45 (2014) 1148e1156  1155  IRA features were given lower priority. This result suggests that perhaps mission-critical information (e.g., convoy attacked) should be made more salient than other types of situation awareness in- formation. In addition, although a time-stamped history log of all the major events was included on the Mission Status Display, this feature was rarely used. Unlike in the preliminary study (Scott et al., 2008), most par- ticipants in this study (19 of 24) found the interruption task sufÔ¨Å- ciently distracting. This may be due to several factors, including the fact that most participants found the interruption task stimulating and distracting from the main task; most participants (22 of 24) successfully completed all the assigned secondary tasks. Also, the interruption task was related to the primary task and represented a realistic task, since a mission commander in command and control may be expected to perform frequent map search activities. Finally, participants were told that their performance would be considered in their overall performance rating, which encouraged them to focus on the interruption task and stopped them from thinking about possible post-interruption situations in the primary task. Participants in the preliminary study reported their reliance on memory of the situation before the interruption occurred as their main interruption recovery strategy. Increasing the length of in- terruptions from 1 min to 2 min appeared to help prevent partic- ipants from memorizing the situation. In practice, interruptions may be long and humans are susceptible to memory loss over time. The IRA tool provides interactive event bookmarks of important events that allow them to assess the situation as quickly as possible and to make an informed decision after an interruption. Scenarios were designed so that when participants returned to the primary task after an interruption, they faced a challenging situation in which several important changes had occurred. Arguably, the task of locating and encoding the changes and assessing the situation (also known as SA re-acquisition (Gartenberg et al., 2011)) is cognitively taxing. IRA‚Äôs simpliÔ¨Åed presentation of events placed a smaller premium on maintaining complex representations in working memory and acted as a contextual cue that facilitated memory retrieval and SA recovery. In addition, the iconic repre- sentation of events simpliÔ¨Åed the encoding of perceptual infor- mation (Kieras and Meyer, 1997), and therefore reduced the re- orientation time. Also, in line with the Guided Search Model (Wolfe, 1994), the interactive feature of IRA allowed the partici- pants to minimize the visual search time by directing the partici- pant attention to the events with the highest priority. Overall, the results of this study showed that providing concise visual summary of past events improves supervisory-level performance especially when making complex decisions under time pressure. Participants utilized this visual summary because it enabled them to quickly review the current mission status by narrowing the information options, which was critical under time pressure.  7.  Conclusion  A user study was conducted to assess the effectiveness of interruption recovery assistance in mitigating the negative effects of interruptions for team supervisors in a dynamic, time-critical task environment. The study involved the evaluation of an inter- ruption recovery assistance tool that provided an interactive event timeline that enabled discrete event highlighting directly on the main task displays. The study showed that this tool enabled team supervisors to better assess the situation, and to make timely and accurate decisions after an interruption. More speciÔ¨Åcally, the re- sults showed signiÔ¨Åcant decreases in interruption recovery times when mission commanders of a UAV team task were provided with the interruption recovery assistance tool. Although it was discussed that the simpliÔ¨Åed representation of important events facilitated  the quick encoding of perceptual information and minimized the visual search, further investigation of different features of the IRA in isolation may shed more light on the value of the tool. The study also showed signiÔ¨Åcant increases in the mission commander‚Äôs de- cision accuracy for both simple and complex decisions when pro- vided this recovery assistance. This study is the third study examining the utility of this type of interruption recovery tool e providing an interactive event time- line and discrete event replay (Scott et al., 2006, 2008). A com- parison across the three studies suggests that this type of interruption recovery assistance reduces recovery times more consistently when operators or supervisors are faced with complex decisions after an interruption rather than simple decisions. One possible reason for the limited effect recovery time in the simple decision case is that people may not feel as rushed or pressured to make a decision after an interruption because the decision is relatively straightforward. As a result, they possibly spend more time gathering all the information they could from the interface and act on their decision at the last minute. Furthermore, results from this and the previous studies suggest that the placement of the interactive event timeline could be further integrated into the primary task displays. In this experi- ment, the interactive event timeline was located on the tablet display, which was on a different visual plane than the main task displays and, thus, may not be ideal. Participants had to look back and forth between the different displays in order to use the inter- ruption recovery assistance. This takes time to visually orient to the new view and, as participants in Scott et al.‚Äôs (2008) study reported, was distracting and annoying. Using alternative designs that inte- grate the interruption recovery tool directly into the main task display, for instance into the Map Display used in this study, may address this issue and warrants further investigation. Finally, determining how to track such historical event infor- mation from actual sensor data warrants further investigation. For example, ensuring that events such as target destruction and attacks on convoys are registered on such a decision support display and displayed in real-time may currently be beyond today‚Äôs technology. However, event-logging tools such as the Tactical Ground Reporting System (Talbot, 2008) are currently deployed, and research is un- derway to turn them into real-time information dissemination tools.

s0003687014000271,"  Because of the rapid growth of bicycling communities in recent years, bicycles and riding activities have been researched. Previous studies have primarily focused on riding efÔ¨Åciency (Stone and Hull, 1995; De Vey Mestdagh, 1998), handlebar heights (Kolehmainen et al., 1989), and frame size (Richmond, 1994; Kautz and Hull, 1995). In recent years, the focus of bicycle-related research has gradually shifted to seat (or saddle) design (Groenendijk et al., 1992; Bressel et al., 2009). Chen and Yeh (2012) have observed that the subjective discomfort rating for the buttocks area is rela- tively higher than those for the other parts of the body. Some riders have quit cycling because of unbearable discomfort or harm caused by bicycle seats (Burke, 1994). The contact between the seat and the buttocks is a critical cause of discomfort and pain. Groenendijk et al. (1992) showed that the pressure distribution on the seat is determined by how the pads support the pelvic bones. Richmond (1994) and Matheny (1995) indicated that handlebars that are set too low can induce compression neuropathy and certain overuse symptoms, as well as irritation of the labia in female cyclists and of the prostate in male  * Corresponding author.

Nakamura et al. (1995) examined four long-period and long-distance bicycle-commuting Japanese male students and observed that a nodule had developed near each of their coccygeal regions and the shape corresponded to the saddle of the bicycle. Groenendijk et al. (1992) surveyed 900 cyclists, determining that 36% of men and 42% of women complained about their bicycle seat. The men complained of pain at the pelvic bone, an anaesthetized sexual organ, and pain in the perineal region. Four complaints were speciÔ¨Åc to female cyclists including painful pelvic bones, irritated genitals, burning skin, and a painful coccyx. Groenendijk et al. observed that discomfort for both men and women occurred even during short bicycle trips (3e10 km). Another study examining 453 cyclists showed that the most frequently mentioned complaints were saddle sores (35%), and more women than men experienced discomfort when riding a bicycle or when seated on a saddle (Christiaans and Bremner, 1998). Previous studies on bicycle seats have primarily focused on analyzing traditional seats that exhibit protruding nodes (De Vey Mestdagh, 1998; Bressel and Larson, 2003; Bressel et al., 2007) or analyzing the seat pressure distribution for various commercial seats (Lowe et al., 2004; Sauer et al., 2007; Potter et al., 2008; Bressel et al., 2009). In summary, the protruding node length (PNL) is a crucial difference among various bicycle seats. Differences in the PNL may inÔ¨Çuence a rider‚Äôs comfort when cycling. Traditional seats with a long protruding node provide riding stability (Bressel et al., 2009). However, they increase the pressure on the perineal and groin regions, causing riders to extend  
1182  Y.-L. Chen, Y.-N. Liu / Applied Ergonomics 45 (2014) 1181e1186  their torsos far backward when cycling. In this case, because the proportion of the torso weight on the seat is increased, the pressure on the ischial tuberosity is also increased (Potter et al., 2008). Although nonprotruding node seats can minimize pressure to the anterior perineum (Lowe et al., 2004), and may be helpful in reducing seat injuries, they may also increase the risk of falling injuries if stability is compromised (Bressel et al., 2009). This may be because it is simple to slip off a seat that lacks a protruding node (Dickson, 1985); however, this is unacceptable by riders (Lowe et al., 2004). Bressel and Larson (2003) also determined that most riders felt that the seat was uncomfortable. Therefore, an appro- priate PNL design is critical; however, previous studies on various riding postures and subjective ratings have compared only commercially available bicycle seats (Bressel and Larson, 2003; Bressel et al., 2009; Lowe et al., 2004). In addition to PNL, the design variables for bicycle seats vary substantially and have not been thoroughly researched in previous studies, causing the un- derstanding of the effect of PNL on riding posture and subjective ratings to be limited. In this study, we hypothesized that an optimal PNL may exist for traditional seats; furthermore, seats involving protruding nodes that enable maintaining a proper degree of body stability, reducing discomfort in the perineal region, and guiding the trunk to bend forward during riding, thereby lightening the load on the ischial tuberosity. In the experiment, we collected data regarding the body postures of riders, subjective discomfort ratings, and cycling sta- bility after the participants rode a bicycle for 20 min, using various handle heights and seat PNL combinations to identify the optimal PNL.  2. "
s0003687014000283,"  Work ability reÔ¨Çects the balance between personal resources and job demands (Tengland, 2011; van den Berg et al., 2009). Pre- vious studies show that both low personal resources, e.g. depres- sive symptoms and musculoskeletal pain, and demanding working conditions, e.g. high mental work load, high physical work load, low social support, and low work spirit, are associated with decreased work ability (Deyo and Weinstein, 2001; Elinson et al., 2004; Martimo et al., 2007; Martinez and Latorre, 2006; Miranda et al., 2010; van den Berg et al., 2008; van den Berg et al., 2009). Still, the potential interaction between low personal resources and high job demands when predicting poor work ability is seldom inves- tigated. We hypothesize that low personal resources, as depression and musculoskeletal pain, have a larger negative effect on work ability under conditions of high job demands than under conditions of low job demands.  * Corresponding author.

Reduced work ability is not necessarily global (Tengland, 2011). An employee‚Äôs work ability can be reduced with regard to certain job demands but unaffected with regard to other job demands. Additionally, different health problems may have different effects on work ability. In theory, depressive symptoms will directly affect a person‚Äôs cognitive function and thereby the ability to manage cognitive work tasks (McDermott and Ebmeier, 2009), while musculoskeletal pain affects a person‚Äôs physical function, which can reduce engagement in physically heavy work in order to avoid pain (McCracken and Samuel, 2007). Accordingly, we hypothesize that depression and musculoskeletal pain have different effects on the ability to manage speciÔ¨Åc job demands. However, most studies report effects on overall work ability and not the effect on the ability to manage speciÔ¨Åc job demands (van den Berg et al., 2009). This shortage of knowledge partly stems from that the most widely used questionnaire for the assessment of work ability, the Work Ability Index (de Zwart et al., 2002; van den Berg et al., 2009), concerns physical and mental work ability in broad terms. It is, however, necessary to identify which job demands the employee is unable to meet, if tailored intervention is to be made, and therefore, knowledge about how health problems affect the ability to manage speciÔ¨Åc job demands is warranted.  The Work-Limitation Questionnaire  of  the  respondent‚Äôs  allows difÔ¨Åculty managing a  for an assessment range of physical,  
K. Nabe-Nielsen et al.  / Applied Ergonomics 45 (2014) 1174e1180  1175  psychological, 2008). Yet,  and social demands  (Lerner  et  al., 2001; Munir,  it is the case for the Work Ability Index, the Work-Limi- tation Questionnaire, and also the World Health Organization Health and Work Performance Questionnaire (Kessler et al., 2003) that the  respondent is asked explicitly to assess the impact of his or her health on current work ability. This leaves the appraisal of the causal relationship between health and work ability to the responder and, furthermore, it results in a circular argument when statistically analyzing the association between health and reduced work ability. Consequently, neither the separate effect of poor health nor the interaction between poor health and high job de- mands on work ability can be investigated properly. To sum up, the present study intends to contribute to the liter- ature on work ability by studying the associations of poor health with perceived difÔ¨Åculty managing speciÔ¨Åc job demands and by studying the interaction between poor health and working condi- tions in relation to perceived difÔ¨Åculty managing speciÔ¨Åc job de- mands. By means of a new questionnaire, work ability‚Äô was measured as difÔ¨Åculty managing seven different speciÔ¨Åc job demands without asking the respondent to appraise the inÔ¨Çuence of their health. Poor health was measured as musculoskeletal pain (MSP) and major depression (MD), and working conditions were measured as job demands and social support. More speciÔ¨Åcally, the aims of this cross-sectional study was Ô¨Årst to describe the prevalence of reduced demand-speciÔ¨Åc work ability in a sample of 46-year and 56-year old full-time employees, second to study the association of reduced demand-speciÔ¨Åc work ability with age, gender, and vocational education; third to investigate the association of MSP and MD with reduced demand-speciÔ¨Åc work ability; and fourth to investigate the interaction between speciÔ¨Åc working conditions (job demands and social support) and poor health (MSP and MD) in relation to demand-speciÔ¨Åc work ability.  ‚Äòreduced demand-speciÔ¨Åc  2. Material and methods  2.1. Design, data collection and study population  We used cross-sectional questionnaire data from a subsample of  the 2006-survey of The Danish Longitudinal Study on Work , Unem-  ployment and Health (Christensen et al., 2006). In 2000, a random sample of individuals aged 40 or 50 years by 1st of October 1999 (n ¬º 11,082, response rate 68.5%, Ô¨Ånal sample 7588) was drawn from The Danish Institute of Governmental Research Longitudinal Register. This register contains data on 10% of the Danish population aged 15 years or older. Data for the survey were collected by postal questionnaires, including two reminders for non-respondents. In 2006, 4893 of the now 46- and 56-year old baseline re- spondents (64.5%) returned a follow-up questionnaire which included questions on demand-speciÔ¨Åc work ability. The subsam- ple used in the present paper comprised the 3381 participants who indicated the length of their vocational education and who were full-time employed (>30 h per week) at the time of the data collection. The distribution of gender, vocational education, health, working condition and reduced demand-speciÔ¨Åc work ability for each age group is presented in Table 1.  Table 1 Description of the participants in the two age-groups of the study.

We deÔ¨Åned MSP cases as re- spondents that were severely affected by MSP, i.e. participants with daily MSP (i.e. answering ‚Äòyes, daily‚Äô to at least one of the questions on MSP) and we deÔ¨Åned MSP non-cases as participants without daily MSP. To measure MD we used the Major Depression Inventory (MDI) which contains a symptom list that covers the ICD-10 and DSM-IV symptoms of depression. The MDI includes 12 questions, for example, ‚ÄòHave you felt low in spirits or sad? Have you felt that life wasn‚Äôt worth living?‚Äô and ‚ÄòHave you had trouble sleeping at night?‚Äô. The six response options ranged from ‚Äòall the time‚Äô (coded 5), ‚Äòmost of the time‚Äô (coded 4), ‚Äòa slightly more than half of the time‚Äô (coded 3), ‚Äòslightly less than half of the time‚Äô (coded 2), ‚Äòsome of the time‚Äô (coded 1) ‚Äòat no time‚Äô (coded 0). For each participant, a mean score was calculated according to the manual with higher scores indi- cating more depressive symptoms (range: 0e50) (Bech et al., 2001). Responders were dichotomized into participants with and without major depression (MD) (cut point by 26 points as recommended by Bech et al. (2001)).  2.2.  Poor health (MSP and MD)  2.3. Working conditions  The participants were asked three questions about MSP: i) Do you have pain in the upper part of your back or neck? ii) Do you have low back pain? iii) Do you have pain in other joints (e.g., Ô¨Ångers, shoulders, hips, knees, or ankles)? The six response options were ‚Äòyes, daily‚Äô, ‚Äòyes, a couple of times each week‚Äô, ‚Äòa couple of  A total of seven separate variables measuring job demands and social support were included in the study:  1) Physical job demands 2) Demands to accomplish high amounts of work  
1176  K. Nabe-Nielsen et al.  / Applied Ergonomics 45 (2014) 1174e1180  3) Demands to work fast 4) Demands to make quick decisions 5) Memory demands 6) Emotional demands 7) Social support.  According to the manual, the response options for all the de- mands questions were ‚Äòalways‚Äô (coded 100), ‚Äòoften‚Äô (coded 67), ‚Äòsometimes‚Äô (coded 33) and ‚Äònever‚Äô (coded 0); a higher score thus indicated a higher frequency of the demands. The response options for social support questions were ‚Äòalways‚Äô (coded 0), ‚Äòoften‚Äô (coded 33), ‚Äòsometimes‚Äô (coded 67), ‚Äònever‚Äô (coded 100) and ‚Äònot relevant‚Äô (the latter was excluded from analysis); a higher score thus indi- cated lack of social support. All variables were dichotomized by a cut-off at 50 points (i.e. the middle of the scale) into low versus high demands, and high versus low social support. This means that participants who were categorized as exposed to high demands on average responded ‚Äòalways‚Äô or ‚Äòoften‚Äô to the demands question. Participants who were categorized as exposed to low social support on average responded ‚Äòsometimes‚Äô or ‚Äònever‚Äô to questions on social support (those responding ‚Äòalways‚Äô or ‚Äòoften‚Äô were categorized as having high social support and thus considered ‚Äòunexposed‚Äô in the present study). This dichotomization of working conditions corre- sponds well with our deÔ¨Ånition of reduced demand-speciÔ¨Åc work ability as responding often/always having difÔ¨Åculties managing the speciÔ¨Åed work tasks. The measure of physical  job demands (1) originated from the (Burr et al., 2003). The measure concerned how often you work in a stooping posture, twist your back several times per hour, lift or transfer heavy objects or persons, and push or pull heavy objects (4 items). The measures of psychosocial job demands and social support originated from the (Pejtersen et al., 2010). Demands to accomplish high amounts of work (2) concerned unevenly distributed work, insufÔ¨Åcient time to complete work tasks, and getting behind with work (3 items). Demands to work fast (3) concerned working very fast and at a high pace throughout the day (2 items). Demands to make quick de- cisions (4) concerned requirements of quick decisions (1 item). Memory demands (5) concerned requirements of remembering a lot of things (1 item). Emotional demands (6) concerned emotionally demanding work (1 item). Social support (7) con- cerned the opportunity to get help and support from colleagues and colleagues being willing to listen to problems at work (2 items).  Danish Work Environment Cohort  Questionnaire  Study  Copenhagen  Psychosocial  2.4. Demographics  We obtained information on age, gender, and length of voca- tional education (none, semi-skilled, skilled (e.g. carpenter), short (<3 years; e.g. market economist), middle-ranged (3e4 years; e.g. bachelor‚Äôs degree), long (>4 years, e.g. physician)). These variables were included in the statistical analyses as they could potentially confound the association between MSP/MD and work ability.  2.5.  Reduced demand-speciÔ¨Åc work ability  The  items measuring  demand-speciÔ¨Åc work  ability were  developed for The Danish Longitudinal Study on Work , Unemploy-  ment and Health, and they have not been reported previously. To estimate reductions in the demand-speciÔ¨Åc work ability of the participants, we asked ‚ÄòWhen you think about the last two months, how often have you had difÔ¨Åculty doing the following in your paid employment?‚Äô followed by (we present a shortened version of the variable names in squared brackets):  a. Managing the physical job demands (lifting, carrying, pushing, pulling, standing, bending etc.) [physical] b. Managing the amount of work [amount] c. Managing the pace of work [pace] d. Making quick decisions [decisions] e. Remembering the things that are  your work  important  for  tasks? [memory]  f. Working with customers, patients, or  students/pupils  [client  work]  g. Working together with colleagues [co-operation]  The six response options were ‚Äòalways‚Äô, ‚Äòoften‚Äô, ‚Äòsometimes‚Äô, ‚Äòseldom‚Äô, ‚Äònever‚Äô, and ‚Äònot relevant‚Äô. The ‚Äònot relevant‚Äô category was excluded as we intended that this response category should be used by the participant not exposed to the type of job demand that the demand-speciÔ¨Åc work disability question referred to. In total, 34.1% of the participants responded ‚Äònot relevant‚Äô to the question about difÔ¨Åculty managing the physical job demands and 16.3% responded ‚Äònot relevant‚Äô with respect to difÔ¨Åculty managing client work. The corresponding Ô¨Ågures for the remaining work ability variables ranged from 1.7 to 4.3%. Reduced demand-speciÔ¨Åc work ability was deÔ¨Åned as responding often/always having difÔ¨Åculty managing the speciÔ¨Åed work tasks.  2.6.  Statistical analyses  First, we analyzed the distribution of gender, vocational edu- cation, poor health, working conditions, and the seven measures of reduced demand-speciÔ¨Åc work ability (Table 1). Second, we estimated the mutually adjusted association of age, gender, and length of vocational education (categorical) with the seven measures of reduced demand-speciÔ¨Åc work ability in a bi- nary logistic regression model; the estimates were also adjusted for daily MSP, MD, and speciÔ¨Åc job demands/social support (Table 2). Third, we analyzed the association of each of the seven mea- sures of demand-speciÔ¨Åc work ability with daily MSP and MD (mutually adjusted, Table 3). In Model I, we included MSP, MD, and age. In Model II, we included MSP, MD, age, gender, and length of vocational education. In Model III, we included MSP, MD, age, gender, length of vocational education, and the speciÔ¨Åc job demand or social support variable. Fourth, we analyzed whether there was multiplicative or addi- tive interaction between the speciÔ¨Åc job demand/low social sup- port and MSP/MD regarding each of the seven measures of reduced demand-speciÔ¨Åc work ability. To test for multiplicative interaction, we added an interaction term (e.g. MSP*job demand or MD*job demand) to the analyses presented in Model III, Table 3 (data on interactions not shown in tables). To test for additive interaction, we constructed new variables combining the main exposures (MSP/ MD and job demands/social support) to estimate the odds of reduced demand-speciÔ¨Åc work ability among employees, for example, (1) low physical demands √æ no MSP (reference); (2) low physical demands √æ MSP; (3) high physical demands √æ no MSP; (4) high physical demands √æ MSP. Based on the results from the ana- lyses of the associations between these new variables and demand- speciÔ¨Åc work ability we calculated estimates of Relative Excess Risk of Interaction (RERI) and their 95% conÔ¨Ådence intervals (Knol et al., 2011; Lundberg et al., 1996). Cases with missing values were excluded analysis by analysis (i.e. each participant was included in the analyses where he/she had no missing values and excluded only from the analyses where he/she had missing values). All included cases had full information on age, gender, and vocational education. For all exposure variables (i.e. poor health and working conditions) 1.0% had missing values (n ¬º 25 to 30 cases), except for social support with 3.5% missing  
values (n ¬º 117). For all outcome variables (i.e. reduced demand- speciÔ¨Åc work ability) 1.5% had missing values (n ¬º 44 to 52 cases), except for difÔ¨Åculty working with costumers, patients, or students/pupils with 2.3% missing values (n ¬º 79). For the two variables with the highest percentage of missing values (i.e. ‚Äòsocial support‚Äô and ‚ÄòdifÔ¨Åculty working with cos- tumers, patients, or students/pupils‚Äô) we analyzed if those with missing values differed from those with non-missing values. We found no statistically signiÔ¨Åcant differences for ‚Äòsocial support‚Äô with respect to age, gender, and education. For ‚ÄòdifÔ¨Åculties working with costumers, patients, or students/pupils‚Äô, we found  more missing values (p ¬º 0.032) among the 46-year old (n ¬º 31, 2.1%) than among the 56-year old (n ¬º 48, 3.5%). We also found more missing values (p < 0.001) among those with no education (n ¬º 19, 10.4%) tion (n ¬º 8, 0.9%). than among those with a middle-ranged educa-  3.

1178  K. Nabe-Nielsen et al.  / Applied Ergonomics 45 (2014) 1174e1180  3.1.  The prevalence of reduced demand-speciÔ¨Åc work ability  In the group of 46-year old employees, 8e10% of the participants often or always had difÔ¨Åculty making quick decisions, working with customers, patients, or students/pupils, or working together with colleagues (Table 1). In this age-group 12.4% experienced difÔ¨Åculty remembering important things, 14.5% experienced difÔ¨Åculty man- aging the physical demands of work, and 15.5% experienced difÔ¨Å- culty managing the pace of work. Almost one Ô¨Åfth of the 46-year old employees (19.3%) reported difÔ¨Åculty managing the amount of work. In the group of 56-year old employees 10e12% of the partici- pants often or always had difÔ¨Åculty making quick decisions, working with customers, patients or students/pupils, or working together with colleagues. In this age-group 14.1% experienced dif- Ô¨Åculty remembering important things, 16.3% experienced difÔ¨Åculty managing the pace of work, and 18.0% experienced difÔ¨Åculty managing the physical demands of work. More than one Ô¨Åfth of the 56-year old employees (21.4%) reported difÔ¨Åculty managing the amount of work.  3.2. The association of age, gender and vocational education with reduced demand-speciÔ¨Åc work ability  The odds of difÔ¨Åculty making quick decisions and difÔ¨Åculty working together with colleagues were signiÔ¨Åcantly increased among the 56-year old as compared with 46-years old (Table 2). Women had signiÔ¨Åcantly lower odds of experiencing difÔ¨Åculty making quick decisions, remembering important things, working with costumers, patients, or students/pupils, and working together with colleagues (Table 2). Having no vocational education was associated with all measures of reduced demand-speciÔ¨Åc work ability and for all outcome measures the association was strongest in this exposure group (OR‚Äôs ranging from 1.7 to 3.8). The most pronounced associations between length of vocational education and reduced demand-speciÔ¨Åc work ability were observed for dif- Ô¨Åculty managing physical job demands and making quick decisions and for difÔ¨Åculties working with costumers, patients, or students/ pupils and working with colleagues.  3.3. The association of poor health with reduced demand-speciÔ¨Åc work ability  In the fully adjusted model (Model III, Table 3), we found that MSP was signiÔ¨Åcantly associated with difÔ¨Åculty managing the physical job demands, and the amount and pace of work, and with difÔ¨Åculty remembering important things with odds ratios ranging from 1.3 to 1.4. MD was signiÔ¨Åcantly associated with all measures of demand-speciÔ¨Åc work ability except for the ability of working with customers, patients, or students/pupils with odds ratios ranging from 1.8 to 3.6. Thus, overall there appeared to be larger associa- tions between MD and measures of reduced demand-speciÔ¨Åc work ability and additionally, MD was more often related to demand- speciÔ¨Åc work ability (six out of seven measures) than MSP (four out of seven measures).  3.4. The association of working conditions with reduced demand- speciÔ¨Åc work ability  In the fully adjusted model (Model III, Table 3), we also found a strong association between demand-speciÔ¨Åc work ability and high (OR ¬º 2.0; 95% CI: 1.6e2.7), demands physical accomplish high amounts of work (OR ¬º 5.1; 95% CI: 4.2e6.2), and job demands to high demands to work fast (OR ¬º 2.3; 95% CI: 1.9e2.8). Additionally, we found a moderate association between demand-speciÔ¨Åc work  ability and high demands to make quick decisions (OR ¬º 1.5; 95% CI: 1.2e2.0) and high emotional demands (OR ¬º 1.5; 95% CI: 1.1e 2.0).  3.5. The interaction between working conditions and poor health on reduced demand-speciÔ¨Åc work ability  We found that the combination of MSP/MD and job demands/ social support was not associated with more frequent reporting of reduced demand-speciÔ¨Åc work ability than expected from the product of the individual effects of job demands and health prob- lems (i.e. p for multiplicative interaction >0.05; data not shown in tables). Only in one case our analyses showed a signiÔ¨Åcant inter- action between job demands (emotional demands) and poor health (MSP) (p ¬º 0.013). The interaction worked in the opposite direction than hypothesized: The combination of high emotional demands and MSP was associated with lower odds of reduced demand- speciÔ¨Åc work ability (i.e. difÔ¨Åculty working with costumers, pa- tients, or students/pupils) than expected from the product of the individual effects of high emotional demands and MSP. The test for additive interaction showed the same results as the test for mul- MSP interacted signiÔ¨Åcantly (RERI ¬º  1.1; 95% CI:  2.0 to  0.2; tiplicative interaction: Only high emotional demands and daily data not shown in tables).  4. Discussion  4.1.  Summary of  the results  We found that middle-aged full-time employees most frequently reported difÔ¨Åculty managing the amount of work (about 20%) and most seldom reported difÔ¨Åculty working with costumers etc. and working together with colleagues (about 10%). The oldest age group showed 30% increased odds of difÔ¨Åculty making quick decision, and working together with colleagues. Women less frequently reported reduced demand-speciÔ¨Åc work ability as compared with men, and in general the odds of reduced demand- speciÔ¨Åc work ability increased with decreasing length of voca- tional education being especially high among those without any vocational education. We found that MD was signiÔ¨Åcantly associated with six out of the seven measures of demand-speciÔ¨Åc work ability, and, thus, the effect was not as speciÔ¨Åc as hypothesized. An explanation could be that depressive core symptoms like loss of interest and energy might interfere with any kind of work demand (Adler et al., 2006). MSP was associated with four out of the seven measures of reduced demand-speciÔ¨Åc work ability. As with MD, the associations be- tween MSP and reduced demand-speciÔ¨Åc work ability were less speciÔ¨Åc than hypothesized (i.e. not only associated with difÔ¨Åculties managing physical job demands) as MSP was also associated with difÔ¨Åculty remembering important things. The reason for this Ô¨Ånding may be that persons with MSP perceive cognitive impair- ment as result of attention deÔ¨Åcit caused by persistent pain, which could interfere with cognitive demands (Oosterman et al., 2011). Interestingly, neither MSP nor MD was signiÔ¨Åcantly associated with perceived difÔ¨Åculty working with customers, patients, or students/ pupils. This Ô¨Ånding may, for example, be due to strong selection out of client work or that the work tasks related to client work have been adapted to the employee‚Äôs mental and physical limitations. This study did not conÔ¨Årm the hypothesis of an interaction be- tween working conditions and poor health in relation to demands- speciÔ¨Åc work ability. Analyses of both multiplicative and additive interaction showed non-signiÔ¨Åcant results, with one exception that was in the opposite direction of what we hypothesized, and due to  
K. Nabe-Nielsen et al.  / Applied Ergonomics 45 (2014) 1174e1180  1179  the number of statistical tests it is likely that this interaction be- tween emotional demands and MSP was a chance Ô¨Ånding.  4.2.  Comparison with previous research  In line with our Ô¨Åndings, a recent review concluded that poor work ability is associated with high mental work demands and high physical workload (van den Berg et al., 2009). Yet, our measures of work ability were related to different, speciÔ¨Åc job demands. Our results also support the newer Ô¨Åndings of an association between MSP and poor physical, mental, and general work ability (Miranda et al., 2010; Neupane et al., 2013). Musculoskeletal dis- orders have also been associated with being only ‚Äòpartially able‚Äô or ‚Äòunable to work‚Äô (Martimo et al., 2007), and back pain has been associated with poor work ability two years later (Karlsson et al., 2010). Our Ô¨Åndings of associations between MD and reduced demand-speciÔ¨Åc work ability support the previous reports of an association between mental disorders and being only ‚Äòpartially able‚Äô or ‚Äòunable to work‚Äô (Martimo et al., 2007) and the effect of good mental health on general work ability (van de Vijfeijke et al., 2013). With respect to the effect of working conditions on work ability, the literature indicates that high mental workload, high physical workload, and low social support are important factors with respect to reduced work ability (Martimo et al., 2007; van den Berg et al., 2008; van den Berg et al., 2009). In the present study, we found associations between demand-speciÔ¨Åc work ability and high physical demands, demands to accomplish high amounts of work, high demands to work fast and to make quick decision, and high emotional demands even when adjusting for poor health. Thus, even among full-time employees there appear to be mismatches between job demands and work ability. One previous prospective study analyzed combinations of job demands and multi-site pain and their interaction. The study found that multi-site pain predicted poor general work ability even when physical and psychosocial working conditions were favorable. In contrast, only ‚Äòawkward postures‚Äô appeared to inÔ¨Çuence work ability in employees without multi-site pain. (Neupane et al., 2013). As in our study, the Neupane et al. study (2013) did not Ô¨Ånd support for the hypothesis that demanding working conditions exacerbate the effect of poor health on work ability.  4.3.  Strengths and limitations  The strength of the study lies in its large sample encompassing middle-aged full-time employees of both genders with various educational levels and with a rather stable connection to the labor market. The participants were not asked to take their health status into consideration when reporting if they had difÔ¨Åculty managing the seven speciÔ¨Åc job demands. The questions on working conditions concerned the frequency of exposure and the questions on demands-speciÔ¨Åc work ability con- cerned whether the participants‚Äô have difÔ¨Åculty accomplishing the demands of the job. Still, our study is limited by its cross-sectional design with self-reported exposures and outcomes, and at least three simultaneously operating ‚Äòprocesses‚Äô may bias the results of the present study: First, participants not being able to accomplish certain demands may be assigned to other less demanding tasks (i.e. selection). Second, poor demand-speciÔ¨Åc work ability could increase the risk of overreporting the job demands (i.e. differential misclassiÔ¨Åcation). Third, high job demands may be both a cause and a consequence of reduced demand-speciÔ¨Åc work ability (i.e. reverse causation). The latter is of special importance regarding the scale measuring the demands of accomplishing high amounts of work, as the  participants are asked ‚ÄòDoes it happen that you do not complete all your work tasks?‚Äô and ‚ÄòDo you get behind with your work?‚Äô. The interpretation of these demand-questions is ambiguous as the reason for not completing work tasks or getting behind with work could both be related to working conditions (e.g. imbalance be- tween number of tasks and the assigned time) and to the em- ployee‚Äôs ability accomplish the assigned tasks fast enough (i.e. work ability). Also, the experience of high emotional demands could be both a cause and a consequence of difÔ¨Åculty working with cus- tomers, clients, or students/pupils. Finally, the experience of low social support in terms the opportunity to get help and support from colleagues and colleagues being willing to listen to problems at work could be both a cause and a consequence of difÔ¨Åculty working together with colleagues. Poor health, especially MD, may inÔ¨Çuence both the perception of job demands and work ability negatively (Stansfeld and Candy, 2006). Thus, combinations of self-reports and objective assess- ments would improve the evaluation of employee work ability. For example, a recent study showed that, in patients with musculo- skeletal disorders, performance-based measures predicted work participation (Kuijer et al., 2012). Still, we suggest that the in- dividual‚Äôs own perception of the ability to manage speciÔ¨Åc job demands is of utmost importance for actual performance. To reduce the risk of residual and unmeasured confounding, we only included respondents with full-time employment, as, for example, it is likely that part-times and full-timers respond differently to questions about the frequency of exposures in the working environment. The drawback of such a restriction of the study population is reduced power and limitations in generaliz- ability. The relatively small differences in demand-speciÔ¨Åc work ability between the 46-years old and the 56-years old group may be due to that the oldest group is more selected than the youngest group (the healthy worker effect). Caused by the cross-sectional design, the present study could not shed light on selection pro- cesses into and out of (full-time) employment. Nevertheless, we showed that signs of reduced ability to manage speciÔ¨Åc job de- mands appear even in a sample of full-time employees who should ideally be part of the workforce for another 10e20 years depending on the age of retirement. As even moderately reduced work ability predicts future disability and death (von Bonsdorff et al., 2011) our Ô¨Åndings point to the importance of early initiatives to detect and intervene against poor work ability and its potential causes, e.g. poor health and high job demands. One way of intervening could be a reduction of depressive symptoms and better matching of job demands with the employee‚Äôs physical and mental resources. Additionally, recent studies indicate that internal health-related control beliefs mod- erate the associations between work-related stressors and work ability (Bethge and Radoschewski, 2010), and job control appears to buffer the relation between poor work ability and productivity loss at work (van den Berg et al., 2011). Another recent study found that active coping increased the positive effect of good mental health on work ability and that avoidant coping increased the negative effect of poor mental health on work ability (van de Vijfeijke et al., 2013). Thus, whereas there is no evidence of an interaction between job demands and health, coping styles may inÔ¨Çuence the effect of mental health on work ability.  5.  Conclusion  In conclusion, we found that middle-aged full-time employees reported most difÔ¨Åculty managing the physical demands and dif- Ô¨Åculty managing the amount of work and pace of work. In general, there was only small to moderate differences between age groups and gender with respect to reduced demand-speciÔ¨Åc work ability  
1180  K. Nabe-Nielsen et al.  / Applied Ergonomics 45 (2014) 1174e1180  and in general shorter vocational education was associated with higher odds of reduced demands-speciÔ¨Åc work ability. MD had larger associations with reduced demand-speciÔ¨Åc work ability than MSP. However, both MSP and MD were related to dif- Ô¨Åculty managing physical job demands, difÔ¨Åculty managing the amount and pace of work, and difÔ¨Åculty remembering important things. Furthermore, MD was associated with difÔ¨Åculty making quick decisions and difÔ¨Åculty working together with colleagues. Thus, the associations between poor health and reduced demand- speciÔ¨Åc work ability were less speciÔ¨Åc than we hypothesized. This study did not conÔ¨Årm an interaction between working conditions and poor health with regard to demand-speciÔ¨Åc work ability, i.e. high job demands or low social support did not appear to increase the association between poor health and reduced demand-speciÔ¨Åc work ability.

s0003687014000295,"  Considering the amount of time drivers are behind the wheel, drivers‚Äô wants, needs and comfort with the steering wheel are of importance. Because of heavier trafÔ¨Åc and congestion on roadways, average commutes are getting increasingly long. The number of commuters tripled between 1960 and 2000 (Federal Highway Administration, 2011). In 2000, 40% of commuters in metro areas traveled over 30 min to work one way, and 14% traveled over 45 min one way (Federal Highway Administration, 2011). One of the primary interactions drivers have with their car during travel time is via the steering wheel. Ideally for safety reasons, drivers should grip the wheel with two hands at all times. However, naturalistic studies have concluded that this is frequently not the case (Jonsson, 2011; Walton and Thomas, 2005). Designing a steering wheel with ideal characteristics to suit various driver populations may elicit safe driving behaviors as well as accommodate drivers with greater comfort during long commutes and short drives. This study focused on driver impressions of steering wheel grips in order to inform steering wheel design and future research. The automotive industry has a particular interest in the Baby Boomer  * Corresponding author. jobrook@clemson.edu (J.O. Brooks).

In addition, Baby Boomers face physical challenges not typical of Generation-Y, such as arthritis. Currently, approximately half of Baby Boomers suffer from arthritis, and it is projected that by 2020, there will be 26 million cases (Hootman and Helmick, 2006). Male participants from two different groups (16 Generation-Y, deÔ¨Åned as born between 1977 and 1994, and 16 Baby Boomers, deÔ¨Åned as born between 1946 and 1964) sat in four different production ve- hicles and were asked a series of questions about the grip in the vehicle. In addition, anthropometric data were collected.  1.1. History of steering wheel designs  Historically, before the steering wheel, automobiles were equipped with a steering tiller, essentially a joystick that made controlling the vehicle difÔ¨Åcult. In 1899 the Ô¨Årst car was Ô¨Åtted with a steering wheel to provide increased control and stability (Patrascu, 2010). Though power steering existed in primitive forms as long ago as 1902, it was not widely adopted into vehicle design until 1956 (Patrascu, 2010). While, some automotive companies voluntarily elected to include airbags in their vehicles in the 1970‚Äôs, it was not until 1998 that air bags became mandatory on all new vehicles slated for sale in the USA, which caused a signiÔ¨Åcant  
1188  M.E. Mossey et al.  / Applied Ergonomics 45 (2014) 1187e1195  change to steering wheel design (Federal Legislation, 2013). The steering wheel served no other purpose than physically maneu- vering the vehicle, accommodating the horn, and housing airbags, until the 1990s when technology in vehicles rapidly expanded and began to envelope the center console, while many of the controls began to migrate onto the steering wheel (Patrascu, 2010). Today, airbag regulations, numerous controls, and the needs of designers and engineers dictate the size and shape of the steering wheel (Patrascu, 2010). The overall design of the steering wheel has remained largely stagnate over the last century, and currently very little research is being done regarding drivers‚Äô use of and prefer- ences in steering wheel grip design.  1.2.  Current steering wheel research  1.2.1. Occupant packaging  Occupant packaging is deÔ¨Åned as the layout of space dedicated for the driver and passengers of the vehicle, which include the seat and steering wheel positioning. With the help of past research, the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) has generated numerous recommended practices for occupant packaging, such as driver hand control reach, driver selected seat position, and driver‚Äôs eye locations (SAE International, 2007, 2010, 2011). In 1979 Schneider, Olson, Anderson, and Post contributed to the SAE standards by identifying the variables that most affect a driver‚Äôs selected posi- tion. The primary objective of Schneider et al.‚Äôs (1979) research was to measure differences between driver‚Äôs selected seat position in a non-driving (static) versus driving (dynamic) condition, using 51 male and 57 female participants in six different vehicles. The au- thors found that the mean difference between static and dynamic adjustments was less than 1.27 cm. In other words, the Ô¨Åndings of Schneider et al. (1979) demonstrated that static seat position ac- commodates the majority of a driver‚Äôs seating preferences. Because of the Schneider et al. study, studies that use static seating positions have become standard practice. In addition, Schnieder et al. used stepwise regression analysis to explain the seating variance among participants using 13 measured anthropometric values. Stature overwhelmingly explained be- tween 32% and 62% of the variance for selected fore and aft seat position, and when adjustments were made to accommodate for height of participants, gender differences appeared to be uniform (Schneider et al., 1979). At present, engineers consider steering wheels within the context of occupant packaging with an emphasis on anthropo- metric data and ergonomic principles. Moreover, engineers focus on occupant packaging to ensure the safety of drivers and pas- sengers as well as other large aspects of the vehicle, such as wheelbase and roof height. Even though the steering wheel is one of the many aspects considered, simply including it in packaging does not ensure an adequate or desirable design. Many studies have been done to create an effective occupant package methodology (Reed et al., 1999; Vogt et al., 2005). However, simply integrating the steering wheel in the large-scale ergonomics of the vehicle does not sufÔ¨Åciently consider other elements of the steering wheel such as on-wheel controls, materials and grip design.  1.2.2. Naturalistic studies  Few studies have focused on drivers‚Äô hand positions on the grip of the steering wheel. An on-road observational study by Walton and Thomas (2005) revealed three different ways drivers placed their hands on the steering wheel: 1) two hands on top of the wheel, 2) one hand on top, or 3) two hands on the bottom of the wheel or off the wheel as if driving with knees. They observed drivers in eight different geographical locations and recorded the number of hands visible on the top part of the steering wheel e  either zero, one, or two. The authors found that often times drivers did not grip the steering wheel at the advised ‚Äú10 and 2‚Äù or ‚Äú9 and 3‚Äù in real on-road situations (AAA, 2012; Walton and Thomas, 2005). Across all eight locations, approximately 25% of drivers had two hands on the lower half of the wheel, approximately 25% placed two hands on the top half of the wheel, and approximately 50% used one hand on the top half of the wheel. In the eight on- road locations, there were high, medium and low speed zones, varied trafÔ¨Åc volume, accident zones and varied number of lanes. Walton and Thomas (2005) found that the number of hands on the top part of the steering wheel did not change based on accident zones or lane position (left versus center versus right lane) but did change with higher speeds and greater trafÔ¨Åc volume, as drivers tended to grip the wheel with more hands. Jonsson (2011) conducted a study observing natural hand po- sitions of drivers while on a roadway. A researcher photographed drivers at various times and under various lighting conditions on a 70 km/h, straight roadway. From each photograph, gender, seat belt use, mobile phone use, registration number, as well as hand loca- tion on the steering wheel were recorded. Hand location was recorded in correspondence with a clock dial: 9, 10, 11, 12, 1, 2, 3. Hands below these locations were recorded as 0. Overall, data from 1,894 photographs were recorded. Jonsson (2011) found that females and males differed signiÔ¨Å- cantly in hand placement position. Of the males, 38% placed the left hand on the bottom of the wheel, 55% placed the left hand between positions 9 and 12, and 20% placed the right hand between posi- tions 3 and 12, while females were 50%, 49% and 29%, respectively. There were no signiÔ¨Åcant differences between men and women for placement of the right hand on the bottom of the wheel (males ¬º 78%, females ¬º 71%), at least one hand on the upper half of (males ¬º 72%, females ¬º 61%), and both hands on the the wheel bottom of the wheel (males ¬º 28%, females ¬º 39%). Both hands on the bottom of the wheel were most common as compared to recorded clock positions (i.e., 9, 10, 1, 2). Jonsson (2011) also found that 18% of all drivers in the study placed both hands on the upper half of the steering wheel, which was comparable to the Walton and Thomas (2005) study that stated 25% of drivers used this hand position.  1.2.3.  Simulator studies  Two studies (Imamura et al., 2008, 2009) investigated grip po- sition and style using a driving simulator. The Ô¨Årst study (Imamura et al., 2008) surveyed 11 participants about their grip styles and videoed their hands as they drove in a simulator. Data gathered suggested that grip positions and styles varied widely among drivers and that drivers were not necessarily aware of their grip positions and styles. The second study (Imamura et al., 2009) investigated the possibility of using sensors in the steering wheel grip as a way to measure driver behavior. A prototype of a steering wheel with sensors was developed; however, no data were pre- sented on testing the technology with participants.  1.2.4. Grip characteristics  One study by Nishina et al. (2006) focused on user preferences regarding steering wheel grips. Twenty-one males with extensive driving experience sat in a vehicle and used seven sets of adjectives on a continuum to describe the grip of the wheel (soft/Ô¨Årm, elastic/ stiff, Ô¨Åtting/non-Ô¨Åtting, rough/smooth, luxurious/cheap, steady/ slippery, comfortable/uncomfortable). For example, ‚ÄúÔ¨Årm‚Äù was designated as 1, while ‚Äúsoft‚Äù was designated as 7, and ‚Äúnon-Ô¨Åtting‚Äù was 1, while ‚ÄúÔ¨Åtting‚Äù was 7. The data were analyzed utilizing the Kansei method to create a structural equation model to assess correlations and develop two models based on two distinct differ- ences in user ratings. Both models focus on deÔ¨Åning comfort by

All other descriptors (soft, elastic, steady, dry, and rough) were based on correlations with these two terms. One model was more strongly correlated with the terms ‚Äúsoft/Ô¨Årm‚Äù, while the other was more strongly correlated with the terms ‚Äúelastic/stiff‚Äù. Ideally, en- gineers could use these models to design steering wheels that meet the expectations of drivers. With increasing attention on vehicle interiors and comfort, the steering wheel may now be a feature of interest for consumers as well as a key safety component. Generation-Y and Baby Boomers are key populations of interest for automobile manufacturers. Ac- cording to a survey by NHTSA in 2009, 17.3% (approximately 36.3 million) drivers are Generation-Y, and 33.3% (approximately 70.7 million) drivers are Baby Boomers. For the youngest drivers, teen- agers between 16 and 19 years, the average commute per day is 25.1 km, and teens that live in urban areas drive signiÔ¨Åcantly more kilometers than teens that live in rural areas (Trowbridge and McDonald, 2008). With urbanization on the rise, this suggests a general increase in the number of kilometers driven by young drivers. According to Coughlin (1999), a signiÔ¨Åcant necessity for the future will be for society to address the increasing numbers of older adults‚Äô needs and preferences. Throughout Europe, parts of Asia, and the United States, the aging population is increasing rapidly. By 2030, the number of people in the U.S. ages 65 and older will be nearly double that of the year 2000 (U.S. Census, 2000). Currently, 80% of the 36 million adults over 65 years are driving (Federal Interagency Forum on Aging Related Statistics, 2008). Thus, spe- cial considerations for aging drivers should be incorporated into vehicle designs. With time spent in vehicles on the rise and the aging driver population increasing, using best practice automotive design becomes paramount, particularly for the most frequently manipulated features such as the steering wheel.  The aim of the current study was to examine driver interactions with steering wheels in various vehicles by using anthropometric data, driver grip location, and driver preferences for two groups, Generation-Y and Baby Boomers.  2. Material and methods  2.1.  Participants  Participants consisted of two age groups of licensed drivers: 16 male Baby Boomers (47e65 years old, M ¬º 55, SD ¬º 5.89) and 16 male Generation-Y (18e29 years old, M ¬º 25, SD ¬º 2.03). All par- ticipants had a minimum of two years of driving experience to ensure that they had sufÔ¨Åcient skill in manipulating steering wheels in vehicles. Participants were paid $20 to $25 based upon the time it took to complete the study with a maximum duration of three hours. All participants provided informed consent.  2.2. Materials  For this study, four production vehicles were used e a 1991 Mazda Miata sports car, a 2004 Mazda RX-8 sports car, a 2006 BMW 530xi luxury sedan, and a 2010 Mazda2 economy sedan. See Fig. 1. The vehicle selection provided a broad stratiÔ¨Åcation of vehicle classiÔ¨Åcation covering older and newer design as well as economy versus luxury design. Based on AutoPaciÔ¨Åc‚Äôs New Vehicle Satis- faction Survey, from years 2010e2013, male buyers accounted for an average 77% of the BMW 5-series purchases, 62% of the Mazda2 purchases, and 67% of the Mazda MX-5 (previously called Miata) purchases. Comparable data were only available for the Mazda RX-8 in 2011, where 80% were male buyers. In addition, the age de- mographics selected for this study represent over 52%, 61%, and 58% of the 2010 to 2013 purchases for the BMW 5-series, Mazda2, and  
1190  M.E. Mossey et al.  / Applied Ergonomics 45 (2014) 1187e1195  Mazada MX-5, respectively, and 51% of purchases for the Mazda RX- 8 in 2011 (AutoPaciÔ¨Åc, New Vehicle Satisfaction Survey, 2013). Therefore, the four vehicles used in the current study represent not only a broad range of vehicle classiÔ¨Åcation but also speciÔ¨Åc models that the participant demographics tend to purchase. This study sought to understand driver grip placement in various production vehicles by allowing drivers to behave as they would without outside inÔ¨Çuence. This means that participants were allowed to select their own seating position, and the vehicles were not modiÔ¨Åed in any way. All vehicles had similar black in- teriors and manual transmissions. The BMW 530xi and Mazda RX-8 had leather-wrapped steering wheels, while the Mazda2 and Mazda Miata had simulated leather grips. The Mazda RX-8, Mazda2 and Mazda Miata grip sizes were 2.78 cm in diameter, while the BMW 530xi‚Äôs grip diameter was 3.25 cm. Of the four cars, the 2004 Mazda RX-8 and 2010 Mazda2 had manual tilt steering wheels, which were adjusted via levers on the steering column; the 1991 Mazda Miata had no steering wheel adjustment; the BMW 530xi had a power tilt and telescoping, adjusted via a small joystick on the steering column. Also, all vehicles had front to rear seat adjust- ments. The BMW 530xi and Mazda RX-8 had power, vertical seat adjustments. Other materials utilized to collect data included: seven pairs of wooden dowels ranging from 2.2 cm to 5.1 cm (2.2, 2.5, 2.9, 3.2, 3.8, 4.4, 5.1 cm) in diameter and photos of the steering wheels from the four study vehicles.  2.3.  Procedure  After participants provided consent and demographic data were collected, the researchers asked the participant to grasp seven pairs of various sized wooden dowels (one in each hand) to obtain grip diameter size preferences. Five hand measurements as deÔ¨Åned in Greiner (1991) were obtained: digit 3 length, palm length, digit 3 height, hand breadth, and digit 1 link length. See Fig. 2. The order in which the participants interacted with the vehicles was counterbalanced to avoid confounds from order bias. Partici- pants were instructed to sit in the driver‚Äôs seat of the vehicle and  adjust the seat and steering wheel to a comfortable position, while the researcher sat in the front passenger seat. The participants were asked to take a moment to become familiar with the car and steering wheel and then place their hands on the steering wheel in the most comfortable position. Hand placement was recorded on a spreadsheet by placing dots on a steering wheel outline, which corresponded with the participant‚Äôs grip position. Next, each participant completed seven items about the steering wheel grip. The items from Nishina et al. (2006) were used (soft/Ô¨Årm, pliable/ stiff, Ô¨Åtting/non-Ô¨Åtting, rough/smooth, luxurious/cheap, steady/ slippery, comfortable/uncomfortable) and were rated on a 7-point Likert scale. One sample item was, ‚ÄúOn a scale of ‚Äòluxurious‚Äô being 1 and ‚Äòcheap‚Äô being 7, how would you rate the steering wheel grip?‚Äù Next, each participant was asked to imagine two different driving scenarios (driving on a 5-h highway road trip at 112.7 km/h and driving while stuck in city trafÔ¨Åc for an hour) and rate the comfort of that particular steering wheel using a 1-7 scale, where 1 ¬º very comfortable and 7 ¬º very uncomfortable. Finally, the participant was asked to rank grip preferences based on photos of the four vehicles‚Äô steering wheels. The ‚Äúmost comfortable‚Äù steering wheel grip was ranked one, while the ‚Äúleast comfortable‚Äù was ranked four.  3. Results  3.1.  Calculation  Driver preference was assessed by combining driver hand placement and anthropometric data. In past studies that investi- gated driver hand placement in a naturalistic setting, no anthro- pometric data were measured. Anthropometric data were compared between groups using t tests (a ¬º 0.05) and trends found by using correlations. Driver hand placements were assessed qualitatively by overlaying translucent markers and then categor- ically to assess common locations. Hand placement was compared across vehicles and groups with descriptive data, using the same categories as Jonsson‚Äôs study (2011). Drivers with atypical hand placement were grouped and compared to typical hand placement with t tests.  Fig. 2. Hand measurements used. Top row: digit 3 length, palm length. Bottom row: digit 3 height, hand breadth, and digit 1 link length.  
M.E. Mossey et al.  / Applied Ergonomics 45 (2014) 1187e1195  1191  Grip design was assessed using rank orders of the four steering wheels, and Likert scales were correlated between groups and between vehicles. It should be noted that when testing for mean differences using the T or F statistic, if homogeneity was violated, the Satterthwaite approximation was used.  3.2. Driver behavior  3.2.1. Anthropometric data  To compare the Baby Boomers and Generation-Y groups, inde- pendent samples t tests were conducted on the participants‚Äô hand measurements, body height, and preferred dowel size. The results showed no statistically signiÔ¨Åcant differences on any of the Ô¨Åve hand measurements, body height, or dowel size. Because there were no signiÔ¨Åcant differences between groups for the hand measurements and body height, the groups were combined, and a correlation matrix was calculated to examine relationships be- tween the hand and body height measurements and dowel size preference. See Table 1. No signiÔ¨Åcant correlations were found between hand measurements and dowel size preference. However, many of the hand measurements were correlated with body height. Body height was signiÔ¨Åcantly correlated with dowel size, r ¬º 0.359, p < 0.05. Notably, the most frequently preferred dowel size was 3.175 cm; 18 participants selected this size. Seven participants chose the 3.81 cm diameter dowel; four chose 2.8575 cm; two chose 4.445 cm; one chose 2.54 cm; and none chose 2.225 cm or 5.08 cm.  3.2.2. Driver hand placement  For the data where participants were asked to grip the steering wheel in the most comfortable location during the in-vehicle segment of the study, each data point (i.e., dot) was made trans- lucent and overlaid onto a common background. See Fig. 3. A total of Ô¨Åve participants (3 Generation-Y, 2 Baby Boomer) indicated in at least one vehicle that the most comfortable way to grip the steering wheel was with only one hand. Of these Ô¨Åve participants, three used one hand on more than one vehicle. Table 2 highlights the percentage of several grip locations across both groups and all vehicles. Five (3 Generation-Y, 2 Baby Boomer) of the 32 participants used an asymmetrical hand arrangement on at least one vehicle. Two of those Ô¨Åve had an asymmetrical hand arrangement on more than one vehicle. One participant used both asymmetrical and one-handed grip arrangements. Five participants (3 Generation-Y, 2 Baby Boomer) gripped the steering wheel on the lower half at least once. All Ô¨Åve of these gripped the wheel on the lower half in more than one vehicle. (One of these participants used a mixed conÔ¨Åguration where one hand was on the top of the wheel and the other on the bottom of the wheel where the left hand was on the lower half of the wheel and the right hand on the top half.)  Participants who exhibited any of the atypical hand placement locations (n ¬º 12) were separated into one group and compared to participants who placed both hands, symmetrically, on the top of the steering wheel (n ¬º 20). Hand measurements, body height and dowel size preference were compared between groups. Neither the hand measurements nor dowel size preferences were signiÔ¨Åcantly different between groups, but body height was signiÔ¨Åcantly different, t(27.78) ¬º  2.285, p < 0.05. Participants who gripped the steering wheel in a manner that was not symmetrical and on the top part of the wheel were signiÔ¨Åcantly shorter (M ¬º 177.28 cm) in body height than participants who gripped the wheel symmetri- cally on top (M ¬º 181.74 cm).  3.3. Grip design preferences  3.3.1.  Rank orders  Referencing photographs of vehicle steering wheels, partici- pants were asked to rank order the steering wheels from most preferred (1) to least preferred (4). See Table 3. Generation-Y par- ticipants ranked the Mazda RX-8 as Ô¨Årst preference (38%) more than Baby Boomers (6%). Baby Boomers ranked the BMW 530XI as Ô¨Årst preference (81%) more than Generation-Y participants (56%). There were no signiÔ¨Åcant differences between the Generation-Y and Baby Boomer groups for all other rankings.  3.3.2.  Likert scales  cheap  Vehicle steering wheels were compared using the seven Likert scale ratings (soft/Ô¨Årm, pliable/stiff, Ô¨Åtting/nonÔ¨Åtting, etc.) be- tween groups (Generation-Y and Baby Boomers).

Discussion  The aim of the current study was to examine driver interactions with production steering wheels in four vehicles by using anthro- pometric data, driver hand placement, and driver grip design preferences for Generation-Y and Baby Boomers. Results of the current study were in line with previous studies in the literature and provide additional insight regarding driver comfort and behavior. Considerations for steering wheel grip design, driver grip behavior, and future research directions are discussed.

Grip design  In this study most people believed that the most comfortable position to grip the steering wheel was symmetrically (75.8%) and/ or on the top half of the steering wheel (79.7%), while only 10.9% reported that two hands on the bottom of the wheel would be most comfortable. These percentages were signiÔ¨Åcantly larger than those found in Jonsson (2011), 6e12% symmetrical and 28e39% two hands on the lower half. This may be due to the fact that drivers estimate a comfortable position in a static environment differently than in a dynamic environment, or they may be quite unaware of where they place their hands while driving. The participants who gripped the wheel non-symmetrically, one handed, or on the bottom of the wheel, were signiÔ¨Åcantly shorter in body height than those who indicated that gripping the wheel on the top symmetrically would be comfortable. It is possible that abnormal behavior may be due to non-optimal relationship between the ver- tical seat adjustments and vertical steering wheel adjustments for shorter individuals. This may be in line with Jonsson‚Äôs study (2011) which found that females tended to place both hands on the lower half of the wheel when driving, as females tend to have a shorter body height than males (Kroemer et al., 1994).  Table 2 Percentages of speciÔ¨Åc hand positions across all vehicles for both age groups.  Anthropometric data (digit 3 length, palm length, digit 3 height, hand breadth, digit 1 link length, body height, and dowel size preference) showed no signiÔ¨Åcant difference between groups. However, there was a signiÔ¨Åcant correlation between body height and preferred dowel size, r ¬º 0.470, p ¬º 0.007. The majority, 56% of participants, preferred the 3.175 cm dowel size. Three of the four cars used in this study have steering wheels with 2.75 cm di- ameters and one with 3.25 cm. The preferred size, 3.175 cm, lies between the two sizes in this study. While 3.175 cm was commonly selected, in signiÔ¨Åcantly taller or shorter populations, it may be appropriate to use a steering wheel with a larger or smaller diameter. Steering wheel manufacturers ought to consider the ex- pected body height range of their target market to decide on an appropriate grip size. Creating a grip of appropriate diameter for drivers may provide comfort without causing additional muscle strain. Nishina et al. (2006) created a rigid model of grip characteristics based on a single steering wheel design. The current study shows that this model may vary by age group and may not be applicable to all vehicles. See Tables 4a through 4d. Likert scale correlations were different among cars and between age groups. While the Nishina et al.

Determining what is most important to drivers in grip design can greatly impact driver comfort and possibly driving behavior. The ‚ÄúÔ¨Åt‚Äù of the wheel is important to comfort. For Generation-Y, the drivers‚Äô perception of the ‚ÄúÔ¨Åt‚Äù of the wheel was correlated with the comfort of the grip in three of the four vehicles: BMW 530xi, Mazda Miata, and Mazda RX-8. Generation-Y as well as the Baby Boomers rated the Mazda RX-8 as the most Ô¨Åtting. The least Ô¨Åtting car for both groups was the Mazda Miata. The Mazda Miata and Mazda RX-8 cars had grips that were the same diameter but different shapes, which indicate that both the shape and diameter are important to grip design and should be carefully considered in the design process.  5.  Conclusion  This static study showed that Baby Boomers and Generation-Y males tend to grip the steering wheel symmetrically on the upper  half of the wheel. However, this does not coincide with Ô¨Åndings from Walton and Thomas (2005). More participants in this study gripped the steering wheel with two hands on the top half of the wheel than in the naturalistic, dynamic study where participants tended to use one hand on top of the wheel or two hands on the bottom. This discrepancy may indicate that user testing during the design process should be done in both static and dynamic envi- ronments. Also, when modeling occupant packaging, grip behav- iors in both static and dynamic environments should be used. Testing in both environments would lead to a better design that accounts for user behavior in a variety of scenarios. This study provides the platform for a variety of subsequent studies. Future work in this area would beneÔ¨Åt from continued research that includes female populations and additional age groups, such as Generation-X. In addition, validating Nishina et al. (2006) model of grip characteristics could be of particular interest to designers and engineers in automotive interior design. The relationship between driver grip behavior in the vehicles users currently own and behavior in unfamiliar vehicles could further  Table 4c Correlations of Likert scale terms for Generation-Y and Baby Boomer groups for the BMW 530xi.

s0003687014000301,"  In many workplaces it is necessary to protect workers‚Äô hands by using gloves. The effects of gloves on different aspects of hand performance capability have been recognised and investigated in a large number of previous studies (Bradley, 1969; Swain et al., 1970; Riley et al., 1985; Bellingar and Slocum, 1993; Imrhan and Farahmand, 1999; Claudon, 2006; Chang and Shih, 2007; Dianat and Haslegrave, 2008). However, unlike studies of hand perfor- mance capabilities, very few studies have investigated glove design features. In one of the few attempts, Muralidhar et al. (1999) developed two prototype cotton gloves with the thickness vary- ing between different areas of the hand, based on force distribution and sensitivity patterns on the palmar side of the hand (established from various studies), and compared the effects of wearing the prototype gloves with those of wearing a double glove. One of Muralidhar et al.‚Äôs prototype gloves had two and the other four layers of protection in selected hand areas.

The primary consideration in designing protective gloves is protection of the hand from injury or discomfort and it is believed that thicker gloves can provide better protection (Muralidhar et al., 1999). In other words, the primary concern when designing gloves has been hand protection rather than hand performance. This policy may be necessary for protection from hazards, but a uniform thickness of material can lead to gloves that are bulky and clumsy to use, perhaps creating other hazardous conditions such as inap- propriate grasp on the tool, loss of grip strength or range of motion, or reduced sensory feedback and dexterity. The results of a study conducted by Akbar-Khanzadeh et al. (1995) at an automobile plant revealed that only 42% of workers reported comfort while using their protective gloves and also that, when such protective equip- ment was inappropriately designed, workers frequently opposed wearing it due to discomfort. As Feeney (1986) pointed out, the possibility of resistance to wearing protective equipment is one of the considerations that should be carefully examined during the design. There are many design considerations, including material, con- dition of use, task requirements, comfort and environment, that together with glove manufacturing processes and cost make the

Fig. 1 shows a conceptual model of the relationship between design requirements, design considerations/constraints, worker and task. Worker characteristics and design requirements are the inputs to the model, while the design criteria that are generated through the model are the outputs. This model is to develop ergonomic design criteria for evaluation trials rather than a more general model of glove design, and therefore the non- ergonomic parts of design considerations/constraints (i.e. manufacturing process, cost) have been separated out. Glove thickness is obviously an important factor in glove design with its inÔ¨Çuence on dexterity and tactility, as well as on hand and Ô¨Ånger (dis)comfort. Consequently, the material and thickness also have an inÔ¨Çuence on strength capability of handgrip, pinch grip and fore- arm torque. Some of the issues that need investigation, among others, are the extent to which gloves cause difÔ¨Åculty in Ô¨Çexing the Ô¨Ånger joints and the patterns of discomfort in both barehanded and gloved conditions while working with hand tools. The present study was undertaken for this purpose. Two prototype pairs of gloves were designed and constructed, using the evidence that was currently available from published literature. Their effects on a number of hand performance capabilities were measured and the wearers‚Äô subjective assessments were collected. The results with the two prototype gloves were compared with those for bare hand, single-layered glove and double glove conditions. The present study differed from that of Muralidhar et al. (1999) in that the prototype gloves were constructed on the basis of different criteria and also that they were evaluated when performing a work task. The intention was to assist in introducing design alternatives for improving gloves for industrial assembly work. The results of two earlier studies (Dianat et al., 2010, 2012a) which had evaluated the effects of wearing gloves on several aspects of hand performance while working with hand tools (including screwdriver and pliers) showed that the effects of wearing gloves changed over a 2 h work period. So, to have a realistic evaluation of glove effects in a working context, glove evaluation studies need to consider actual working conditions in which gloves are being used by workers.  2. Methodology  There were two phases of work in this study. The Ô¨Årst was to develop new designs of gloves and the second was to run an experiment to evaluate the designs.  2.1.  Re-design of gloves  The prototype gloves were constructed by modifying a glove that is commercially available and widely used for industrial assembly work, the modiÔ¨Åcation being to the thickness of material so that it could be suited to the hand/tool interaction in particular areas of the hand. The two prototype gloves constructed represented two different approaches. One was based on published evidence of the differences in the areas of discomfort between the bare hand and the gloved hand conditions, and the other was based on the need for Ô¨Ånger and hand Ô¨Çexibility while working with tools such as screwdriver and pliers. In other words, the thickness of material was varied over the surface of the hand to reduce the discomfort of wearing gloves or to enhance performance capabilities.  2.1.1.  Construction of  the gloves  The gloves were made of cotton, the thickness of the basic material (of the commercially available glove) being 0.8 mm. The results of the two previous studies (Dianat et al., 2010, 2012a) had already shown that cotton gloves can be a better option for light assembly tasks than nylon or nitrile gloves (1 mm and 1.4 mm in thickness, respectively), which caused more adverse effects on some hand performance capabilities. Two comparison gloves were included in the evaluation trials: the commercial cotton glove and a double thickness (1.6 mm) cotton glove (one glove worn over another, the two being anchored by strategic stitching). The structures of the two prototype designs are shown in Table 1 and described below. Three sizes of each glove (small, medium and large pairs) were prepared for the evaluation trials. To modify the cotton glove, the selected areas which would have just the thin layer of material were Ô¨Årst mapped on to the glove.  Fig. 1. Conceptual model of the relationship between design requirements, design considerations/constraints, worker and task.

Then, for each size of glove, a template of the desired areas was prepared from cardboard. The prepared templates were used later as master patterns to cut holes in the ‚Äúover‚Äù gloves to the correct shape. A pilot test was performed to test whether it would be better to have the glove with the ‚Äúholes‚Äù as the inner glove or as the outer glove. It was thought that, if the edges of the holes caught on the tool or component being manipulated, the glove might deteriorate gradually over the set of evaluation trials or might interfere with the task being performed. Therefore, it was decided that the glove with the ‚Äúholes‚Äù should be the inner glove. This glove with the selected areas removed was placed into another cotton glove of the same size so that it produced a double glove with an unbroken surface for the outer layer. Another difÔ¨Åculty which had to be overcome when constructing the gloves was to make sure that the inner glove could not slip in relation to the outer glove while it was being used. So the two gloves were sewn together, not only at the edges of the holes but also around the sides of the Ô¨Ångers and around the wrist.  2.1.2.  First glove prototype addressing discomfort areas on the hand  The Ô¨Årst approach to re-designing the cotton gloves was to consider the different patterns of discomfort between the bare hand condition and the gloved hand while working with the hand tools. This data was already available from two previous studies by the present authors (Dianat et al., 2010, 2012a). When gloves are worn, tactility (especially in Ô¨Ångertips) and dexterity will be reduced due to the layer of glove material between the hand and the tool‚Äôs handle and this is likely to make it more difÔ¨Åcult to manipulate both the components and the hand tool. Some gloves used in industry have the Ô¨Ångertips of the gloves removed for just this purpose. Therefore, to have better control over the task and tool, the tool handle should be held Ô¨Årmly between the palm and thenar area, with extra support from thumb and index Ô¨Ånger which may lead to more discomfort in these areas of the hand. Several  glove characteristics such as thickness, material and Ô¨Çexibility of the material may be responsible for these effects, but it was too complex to consider all the factors simultaneously, so the present experiment was focused on the glove thickness. The previous studies showed that for the barehanded screw- driver task, the most discomfort was reported in the Ô¨Ångertips of the index and middle Ô¨Ångers. When wearing gloves for this task, the highest levels of discomfort were reported in the palm area, thenar area, and lower part of both the thumb and the index Ô¨Ånger (a diagram identifying each of the areas of the hand can be seen in the Appendix). When working barehanded with pliers, the most discomfort was reported in the palm area. When wearing gloves for the pliers task, the highest levels of discomfort were reported in the lower part of both the thumb and the index Ô¨Ånger. The above Ô¨Åndings indicate that there is more discomfort when wearing gloves than while barehanded. It was hypothesized that removing material to a single layer may help to reduce (or at least not increase) the gloved discomfort and that the thinner single layer may help to reduce the barehanded Ô¨Ångertip discomfort. Therefore, the re-designed glove incorporated these Ô¨Åndings into a glove that had thinner layers in some areas (especially in the region of the Ô¨Ångertips of thumb, index and middle Ô¨Ånger), which should facilitate better sensory feedback and dexterity and so minimise slipping or the need for excessive gripping. For practical reasons, the re-designed gloves were constructed of double cotton gloves so that the selected areas with a thinner layer had a single-layered cotton glove. Fig. 2 shows the areas that had a thinner layer in the Ô¨Årst re-designed glove and the glove itself is shown within Table 1.  2.1.3. Second glove prototype addressing difÔ¨Åculty in Ô¨Çexing the Ô¨Ångers and joints  The second approach to re-design the glove was to consider glove effects that cause difÔ¨Åculty in Ô¨Çexing the Ô¨Ånger joints when working with hand tools. A pilot test was performed which

The areas with the thinner layer to reduce the resistance against Ô¨Ånger and joint Ô¨Çexion movements are shown in Fig. 3(b) and the glove itself is shown within Table 1.  2.2. Design of evaluation trials  2.2.1.  Simulated tasks  For the evaluation trials, participants performed a simulated assembly task using the same experimental equipment and layout as in the previous studies by Dianat et al. (2010, 2012a). The task involved the use of both a screwdriver and pliers, which are two different hand tools commonly used in assembly operations and together demonstrate a range of task demands. The screwdriving task consisted of using a screwdriver to assemble two components together using screws (Fig. 4(a)). The screwdriver had a conven- tional Ô¨Çat head blade with a longitudinal round cross-sectional handle (having a grooved surface). The handle of the screwdriver was 10 cm in length and 3 cm in diameter and the stem was 100 mm  6 mm. The screws were 2.5 cm in length with a screw head diameter of 10 mm. The screwdriver task required that each participant Ô¨Åt and support the two components with his left hand, and then turn a screw into each of the component‚Äôs holes, fastening it with the screwdriver in the right hand. The pliers task was a typical wire tying task using conventional straight type pliers (as frequently used in industry), which had a grip span of 5 cm and weight of 205 g (Fig. 4(b)). The wires were 9 cm in length with a diameter of 1.6 mm. The pliers task required that each participant hold the wire with his left hand and fold both ends of the wire into a U shape using the pliers with the right hand, and then tie the two ends of the U shaped wire together (for one turn).  2.2.2.  Experimental trials  The two independent variables examined in the study were (1) hand condition with Ô¨Åve levels (single-layered cotton glove, dou- ble cotton glove, re-designed glove 1 and re-designed glove 2 as well as barehanded), and (2) point of time within the 2-h duration of the task (with measurements taken at 0, 30, 60, 90 and 120 min). Based on the results of the two earlier studies (Dianat et al., 2010, 2012a) the duration of a 2-h work period appeared to be adequate to evaluate the effects of wearing gloves. Each experimental trial consisted of four 30-min sections of the task (equivalent to a 2-h work period except that short breaks took place at 30 min intervals to permit measurement of the perfor- mance measures and recording of subjective assessments). Therefore, a typical trial lasted for a little over 2 h. The participants were asked to work in turn with screwdrivers and pliers, each for 15 min during each 30-min section of the 2-h work period. Four component assemblies or 30 wire ties were completed during each 15 min. Each participant performed Ô¨Åve trials (2-h work periods) over Ô¨Åve successive weeks, each session testing a different hand condition (with the order of presentation of the hand conditions randomized across the participants). The order in which the two tools (screwdriver and pliers) were used was also randomised across participants within the experimental trials. Performance measures and subjective assessments were taken at intervals over the trial, at the start (0) and then at 30, 60, 90 and 120 min. These were always measured in the same sequence, with the subjective assessments measured prior to the performance measurements to prevent any possible interference. Participants had adequate rest after each 30-min work period while these measurements were recorded, and so it was decided that no further rest periods were required. They were told that they could ask for further rest pe- riods if required, but none did so during the trials. Fig. 5 shows a timeline for the measurements of the different performance  Fig. 2.

It was hypothesized that overcoming the resistance against Ô¨Ånger movements at these points may restrict grip posture or necessitate increased force exertion, which in turn could be another possible reason for greater feelings of discomfort when wearing gloves. Therefore, the second re-designed glove had a completely different pattern of cut-outs from Design 1 e the cut-outs of Design 1 are on the palmar side  Fig. 3.

Measurement of  the dependent variables  Since the glove re-designs focused on glove thickness the per- formance measures of interest were dexterity, tactility and hand strength capability, particularly handgrip, pinch grip and forearm torque. Therefore, the dependent variables measured in the present study were time to complete the pegboard test, number of errors, handgrip strength, pinch strength, forearm torque strength and sensitivity of touch. These measures cover the most important as- pects of hand performance/capability required for working with hand tools in assembly tasks. Other performance measures such as muscle activity and wrist posture were not included because only slight effects of cotton gloves on these performance measures had been found in the previous two studies conducted by the authors (Dianat et al., 2010, 2012a). In addition to the performance mea- sures, subjective assessments (rating of ease of manipulation and hand and Ô¨Ånger discomfort rating) were recorded during the trials. The pegboard test, used to measure hand dexterity, is designed to measure gross movements of the hands, Ô¨Ångers and arms as well as Ô¨Ånger dexterity, and therefore integrates the speed and precision necessary for assembly tasks (Pennathur et al., 2003; Berger et al., 2009). In this test, the participants were instructed to pick up 30 pegs, one at a time from a pegboard, with their non-dominant hand, pass them to their dominant hand, turn them over and place them in another pegboard. They were asked to complete this task as quickly as possible and the time taken to complete the task was recorded by the experimenter using a digital stopwatch. Number of errors, which was also considered as a measure of dexterity, was deÔ¨Åned as the number of objects during each 30-min work period which fell from the hand (i.e. screws, components, wires or hand tools) while performing the simulated assembly task (Dianat et al., 2010). Handgrip strength, strength were three  lateral pinch strength and forearm torque different maximal isometric strength  measurements taken during the experiment. The strength mea- surements followed standard procedures described in the litera- ture. The participants were asked to exert their maximal voluntary strength with their right (dominant) hand and to hold that force for 3 s. Two repetitions of each strength measurement were recorded each time with a 2-min rest break between successive measure- ments, and the average value of the two trials was used for analysis. The two measurements were considered valid if they were within 10% of each other; otherwise the measurement was repeated (Caldwell et al., 1974; Imrhan and Loo, 1989). Handgrip strength was measured using a hand dynamometer (MKIIIa, made by the Medical Physics Department, Queens Medical Centre, University of Nottingham, UK) with a grip span of 5 cm. This hand dynamometer is based on a bridge of strain gauges and has been used in a number of research studies (Peebles and Norris, 2003; Hillman et al., 2005; Dianat et al., 2012a). Handgrip strength was measured in a sitting posture, with the upper arm next to the trunk, the elbow Ô¨Çexed at approximately 90 and the wrist in a neutral position (Mathiowetz gauge (B&L Engineering, Tustin, CA, USA; range ¬º 0e27 kg). Pinch et al., 1985). The lateral pinch strength was measured with a pinch strength measurements were carried out in a sitting position, with the participant‚Äôs shoulder Ô¨Çexed forward by about 30 , the upper arm close to the trunk but slightly abducted and the elbow Ô¨Çexed at about 90 , and the wrist in the neutral position (Imrhan and Loo, 1989). A torque-measuring device (including a torque meter, a T- shaped handle and an AFG 500N Mecmesin Advanced Force Gauge) was used for measurement of the forearm torque strength (Dianat et al., 2010, 2012a). The T-shaped handle made an angle of 70 with its shaft to allow a neutral wrist position during the strength measurements. The torque meter was attached to an AFG 500N Mecmesin Advanced Force Gauge (Mecmesin, Slinfold, West Sus- sex, UK) for recording the torque strength data. Then, the T-shaped handle was attached to the torque meter shaft (mounted on a steel bar), so that the whole apparatus was vertically adjustable to pro- vide the desired height for each participant. Forearm torque strength (in a clockwise direction) was measured in a standing  Fig. 5. Timeline for measurement of dependent variables during each experimental trial.

Dianat et al.  / Applied Ergonomics 45 (2014) 1208e1217  1213  position with the upper arm parallel to the torso, forearm hori- zontal and elbow Ô¨Çexed at 90 (Caldwell et al., 1974; Mital and Kumar 1998). Tactile sensitivity was measured by the monoÔ¨Ålament test, which has been reported to have good reliability and validity (Jerosch-Herald, 2005). A SemmeseWeinstein monoÔ¨Ålament test set (Smith and Nephew Rolyan, Menomane Falls, WI, USA) con- sisting of 20 nylon testing Ô¨Ålaments, all with the same calibrated length of 38 mm but of varying diameters, was used. All mea- surements (which followed the recommended protocol given by Bell-Krotoski, 1990) were conducted by the same investigator in a quiet room. The participants were asked to turn their head away during the measurements so that they could not see their hand. The participants were instructed to say ‚Äútouch‚Äù, when they recognized that they were being touched by a Ô¨Ålament. Each Ô¨Ålament, in turn, was applied vertically (very slowly) over the selected hand area and slowly moved down until the Ô¨Ålament was bent. The Ô¨Ålament was maintained in place bowed over for 1.5 s and then slowly removed over 1.5 s. The Ô¨Ålaments were presented in both ascending and descending orders of diameter so that the participants could not anticipate the order of presentation. Thus, the touch sensitivity threshold was deÔ¨Åned by the smallest Ô¨Ålament that could be sensed by the participant. To investigate the discomfort in different areas of the hand and Ô¨Ångers in more detail a hand map was used, together with a scale of 0e5 (where 0 ¬º No discomfort, 1 ¬º Very low discomfort, 2 ¬º Low 3 ¬º Moderate 4 ¬º High discomfort, discomfort, discomfort and 5 ¬º Extreme discomfort) to measure the severity of the discomfort. The participants were asked to indicate the area of any discomfort that they experienced on the hand map and to rate its severity using the discomfort scale. The responses were then explored in more detail by classifying them into the various areas of the hand and Ô¨Ångers (as deÔ¨Åned in the Appendix). In addition, a 5-point scale rating ease of manipulation (where 1 ¬º very easy, was used for 2 ¬º Easy, 3 ¬º Neutral, 4 ¬º DifÔ¨Åcult and 5 ¬º Very difÔ¨Åcult). The par- ticipants were asked to rate their subjective responses on the scales at the start of each trial and thereafter immediately after Ô¨Ånishing each 30-min work period during the trial.  2.2.4.  Participants  Participants recruited for the experiment were 12 male students from the University of Nottingham, aged between 24 and 34 years (mean age ¬º 30.5 SD ¬º 3.2). All years, participants were right- handed and healthy, with no history of upper limb injury, and  none had been professionally involved in working with hand tools (in particular with pliers or screwdrivers). They each signed a consent form before the start of the trials with the option to withdraw at any stage of the study. All participants were paid ¬£8 per hour for their participation. The study was approved by the local ethical review committee at the University of Nottingham.  2.2.5. Data analysis  Statistical analysis of the data was performed with SPSS soft- ware version 14.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA), including summa- rising descriptive data and mixed model ANOVA for evaluation of the main effects of hand condition and time and of their interaction on the dependent variables. In the mixed model ANOVA, the pa- rameters were estimated using the Restricted Maximal Likelihood (REML) Method and the Covariance structure within time and hand condition groups was selected as Compound Symmetry based on Akaike Information Criteria (AIC). Bonferroni post hoc tests on adjusted means were used to explore the main effects and in- teractions. The discomfort ratings were analysed using the non- parametric Friedman test. P-values < 0.05 were considered statis- tically signiÔ¨Åcant for all analyses.  3. Results  3.1. Dexterity measures  The main Ô¨Åndings of the study are shown in Tables 2 and 3. The results of the ANOVA (given in Table 4) showed a signiÔ¨Åcant main effect of hand condition on both the time to complete the pegboard test (p < 0.05) and the number of errors (p < 0.05). The post hoc tests indicated that while barehanded or when wearing glove design 1, participants completed the pegboard test faster than when wearing double gloves. In addition, the bare hand condition recorded faster pegboard test completion time than when wearing glove design 2. Wearing glove design 1, single-layered glove, glove design 2 and double glove required 4%, 7%, 10% and 11% higher pegboard completion times, respectively, than the bare hand con- dition. Furthermore, the number of errors was affected by the type of glove worn, so that more errors were made with double gloves or glove design 2 than while wearing glove design 1. The mean number of errors over a 30-min work period was 0.29 when wearing glove design 1, followed by 0.47, 0.5, 0.66 and 0.73 for single-layered glove, barehanded, glove design 2 and double glove, respectively (as seen in Table 2).

Time to complete the pegboard test decreased between the start and the end of the task. The time required for completing the pegboard test after 120 min was 8% faster than at time zero.  3.2.  Strength measures  The ANOVA showed a signiÔ¨Åcant main effect of hand condition on the handgrip strength (p < 0.001) but no signiÔ¨Åcant effect on the forearm torque strength or lateral pinch strength. A higher level of handgrip strength was recorded while bare- handed compared to when wearing single-layered cotton gloves, double gloves or glove design 2. The post hoc test showed no sig- niÔ¨Åcant difference between the bare hand and glove design 1, although glove design 1 produced a signiÔ¨Åcantly higher level of handgrip strength than double gloves. Compared to the bare hand condition, grip strength decrements when wearing glove design 1, single-layered glove, glove design 2 and double glove were 4.7%, 7%, 7.2% and 9.5%, respectively. Regarding the time effect, handgrip strength (p < 0.05) and forearm torque strength (p < 0.01) changed signiÔ¨Åcantly over the duration of the task, while no signiÔ¨Åcant effect of time was found on the lateral pinch strength. Based on the post hoc tests, handgrip strength at 60 min was higher than that at time zero. Forearm torque strength also increased between the start and the end of the  
I. Dianat et al.  / Applied Ergonomics 45 (2014) 1208e1217  1215  task, in that forearm torque strengths measured at 90 and 120 min were signiÔ¨Åcantly higher than that recorded at time zero. However, these time effects were small in practical terms. Mean handgrip strength only varied between 40 and 42 N over the 2 h work and forearm torque strength between 10.3 and 11.0 Nm.  3.3.  Touch sensitivity  As shown in Table 3, touch sensitivity in all the hand areas was greatest while barehanded (that, it had lowest Ô¨Ålament force threshold in mN) compared to when wearing gloves. In all hand areas, sensitivity of touch thresholds while barehanded was found to be signiÔ¨Åcantly different from those when wearing any of the gloves. Gloves reduced touch sensitivity in both small and ring Ô¨Ångers (ring mid/proximal phalanges, ring distal phalanx, small mid/proximal phalanges and small distal phalanx areas) more than in the other hand areas. Touch sensitivity thresholds in the thinner areas of glove design 1 were similar to those thresholds when wearing a single-layered cotton glove. No signiÔ¨Åcant difference was found between glove design 2 and double gloves in any of the hand areas. In contrast, signiÔ¨Åcant differences were found in the sensi- tivity thresholds between single-layered cotton gloves and glove design 2 in all hand areas. No signiÔ¨Åcant effect of time was found on touch sensitivity. However, a signiÔ¨Åcant interaction effect was found between hand condition and task time for the touch sensitivity of the thumb distal phalanx and hypothenar area. For the hypothenar area, wearing double gloves and glove design 2 caused more sensitivity decre- ment at the start of the task than at other times, whereas touch sensitivity did not change over time while barehanded or when wearing single-layered gloves or glove design 1.  3.4.  Subjective measures  None of the subjective assessments (i.e. the rating of ease of manipulation and hand and Ô¨Ånger discomfort rating) were found to differ signiÔ¨Åcantly between the hand conditions. The participants rated ease of manipulation as between ‚Äúvery easy‚Äù and ‚Äúeasy‚Äù for all hand conditions, with lowest and highest mean ratings recorded (mean ¬º 1.4; SD ¬º 1.08) (mean ¬º 1.9; SD ¬º 1.20), respectively. Also, relatively similar levels for the bare hand and double gloves of discomfort, that was between ‚Äúvery low‚Äù and ‚Äúlow‚Äù, was recor- ded for all hand areas when performing the simulated tasks with both hand tools. Subjective assessment of the ease of manipulation did change over the duration of the task (p < 0.001), so that better ratings of ease of manipulation were given at the start of the task compared to later. At the beginning of the task, participants rated the task as ‚Äúvery easy‚Äù with a mean rating score of 0.7 (SD ¬º 0.68), compared to as ‚Äúeasy‚Äù with a mean rating score of 2 (SD ¬º 1.05) after 120 min.  4. Discussion  The present study investigated the effect of the two modiÔ¨Åed designs of glove on a number of hand performance capabilities and subjective assessments and also compared their performances against those with bare hand, single-layered cotton glove and double cotton glove while working with pliers and a screwdriver. The two re-designed gloves (e.g. ‚Äòglove design 1‚Äô and ‚Äòglove design 2) were produced from cotton gloves and were based on subjective hand discomfort assessments so that the thickness could be suited to particular areas of the hand (i.e. had thinner layers in some areas). It was hypothesised that manipulation of the glove thickness would improve task performance or maintenance of performance over the duration of a task. The results of the evaluation trials  indicated that some of the performance and strength capabilities of the hand with glove design 1 were comparable to that recorded with the bare hand condition, while no improvements were found in the hand performance capabilities when wearing glove design 2 compared to other conditions. One of the main Ô¨Åndings of the study was that some improve- ments were found in dexterity with glove design 1. The results of the study indicated that the bare hand condition and glove design 1 produced shorter pegboard completion times (which means better dexterity) than double gloves. In contrast, glove design 2 required more time to complete the pegboard test than the bare hand con- dition. The number of errors, which was considered as another measure of hand dexterity while performing the experimental tasks, also improved with glove design 1 in comparison to double gloves or glove design 2. These Ô¨Åndings suggest that the Ô¨Årst pro- totype glove improved dexterity compared to the double glove condition, whilst the second prototype glove showed no improve- ment in this respect. According to these Ô¨Åndings for glove design 1, it seems that the improvement of tactility (especially in Ô¨Ångertips) and dexterity is perhaps a more important consideration in glove design than improved Ô¨Ånger and joint Ô¨Çexibility which was pro- vided by the design of the second prototype glove. Therefore, in terms of hand dexterity, glove design 1 along with the bare hand or single-layered cotton gloves appear to be a better choice than double gloves or glove design 2 for a task that requires Ô¨Åne manipulation while working with hand tools such as screwdrivers and pliers. These Ô¨Åndings would need to be validated in workplace settings but provide a unique insight into the performance issues underpinning the use of gloves for manual tasks. SigniÔ¨Åcant differences were found between handgrip strength measurements, although neither pinch strength nor forearm tor- que strength values were affected by gloves. The greatest handgrip strength was recorded while barehanded, whereas double gloves produced the lowest recorded strength. This Ô¨Ånding suggests that greater grip strength decrement seems to be expected when wearing thicker (double) gloves. This result is in agreement with Ô¨Åndings from other studies (Chang and Shih, 2007; Muralidhar et al., 1999; Dianat et al., 2012a), which have shown grip strength decrements when wearing gloves. Again, these Ô¨Åndings provide a basis for informing the use of gloves in the workplace but would need further validation for speciÔ¨Åc contexts of use. It is also interesting to note that higher handgrip strength values were recorded with the bare hand and glove design 1 compared to when wearing double gloves. A higher level of handgrip strength was also produced with the bare hand condition than with glove design 2, whereas no signiÔ¨Åcant difference was found between the bare hand and glove design 1 in this respect. Thus, compared to the bare hand condition, higher strength decrement seems to be ex- pected when wearing glove design 2 than glove design 1. Therefore, it appears that between the re-designed gloves, only glove design 1 permitted higher handgrip strength than double gloves, which can be considered as an advantage for the Ô¨Årst prototype glove over double gloves for workplace tasks that require handgrip strength while working with hand tools. Perhaps, better grip strength with glove design 1 can be attributed to the better Ô¨Åt between the hand and the tool‚Äôs handle. Therefore, simply in terms of handgrip strength, the bare hand condition or glove design 1 seems to be a better option than single-layered glove, double glove or glove design 2 for a task involving the gripping and use of hand tools such pliers or screwdrivers. However, in terms of pinch strength or forearm torque strength, there is no preference between gloves and no strength decrement or improvement can be expected with re- designed gloves while working with hand tools. As shown by the results of this study, touch sensitivity in terms of Ô¨Ålament force threshold (mN) for all the different hand areas

This supports the Ô¨Åndings of previous studies (Shih et al., 2001; Tiefenthaler et al., 2006; Dianat et al., 2010, 2012a) which have reported touch sensitivity decrements due to gloves. It was also shown that gloves had more of an adverse effect on the touch sensitivity of the small and ring Ô¨Ångers and increased touch sensitivity thresholds in these two Ô¨Ångers more than in the other hand areas. This could indicate a key consideration in designing gloves for use in tasks where Ô¨Åne motor tasks are required or the speciÔ¨Åc sensitivity of these Ô¨Ångers is a key feature of the task (e.g. picking up small components). The results suggest that touch sensitivity in most areas of the hand was less affected by single-layered gloves or glove design 1 than with double gloves or glove design 2, which is not surprising as both double gloves and glove design 2 had two layers at the palm side of the hand. The improved touch sensitivity with glove design 1 may be explained by thinner areas at the palm side of the hand that provide better tactile feedback than double gloves or glove design 2. Therefore, the results suggest that the bare hand condition, single-layered cotton or glove design 1 serve better for a task that involves tactile feed- back and Ô¨Åne manipulation of the task, while double gloves or glove design 2 are not suitable options in this respect. The development of guidelines regarding glove design features in this study was based on a new design of cotton gloves with emphasis on glove thickness as one of the design properties. In addition, the participants in the current study were relatively young, healthy and non-professional workers who spent 2 h assessing each glove condition in controlled laboratory conditions. The working environment in real assembly operations could be different as some glove materials, particularly cotton, may tend to stretch and wear over time and may also be inÔ¨Çuenced by moisture from sweat and the environment. Moreover, repetitive use of the gloves may lead to skin problems such as irritation, blisters and calluses, which were not apparent in the short-term trials that were conducted. Therefore, more detailed studies using different glove materials, thicknesses, hand tools and tasks are required to fully validate the effectiveness of the proposed design in real work- places. Moreover, since hand performance has been less considered in glove designs, it is therefore necessary to take into account de- signs that protect the hands from the environment but at the same time allow optimum hand performance capabilities. To take ac- count of this, hand performance capabilities in each task should be evaluated by both objective and subjective (i.e. preference, comfort, satisfaction, usability, etc.) assessments and designs should be based on improving the hand performance capabilities. Obviously, there are different ways that protective gloves could be designed (i.e. based on minimising local force pressure on the hand, improving grip patterns or friction between the glove and gripping surface, etc.) and therefore, further studies testing other design possibilities based on hand performance capabilities are recom- mended. However, the Ô¨Åndings reported in this paper represent a key stage in verifying which designs show particular advantages in the use of hand tools which then provide a basis for further research in speciÔ¨Åc workplaces.  5.  Conclusions  Two prototype gloves were produced from cotton gloves based on the Ô¨Åndings of subjective hand discomfort assessments for in- dustrial assembly work and aimed to match the glove thickness to the localised pressure, sensitivity and Ô¨Çexibility in different areas of the hand. It was shown that the performance or strength capabilities of the hand with glove design 1 were comparable to that observed with the bare hand condition, so that both produced lower pegboard completion times (i.e. increased dexterity) than double gloves, and  there was a lower number of errors with glove design 1 than with double gloves. Also, glove design 1 and the bare hand condition produced higher handgrip strength values compared to double gloves. Lateral pinch and forearm torque strength capabilities were not affected when wearing any of the gloves in this experiment. It appears that improved dexterity and tactile feedback in some areas of the hand with the Ô¨Årst prototype glove tended to give more im- provements in performance and strength capabilities of the hand than with the second prototype glove. The Ô¨Åndings support the hypothesis that selective variation in thickness over some areas of the hand can be applied to improve industrial glove design. Such an approach is particularly useful for gloves intended to protect the hands from the environment while at the same time allowing better hand performance capabilities. The Ô¨Åndings present a unique insight into the design of gloves for industrial hand tool use but further research is needed to validate the Ô¨Åndings in real work- places, looking at wider factors and local work practices.

s0003687014000313,"  Recently, many researchers have focused on developing more natural user interfaces that facilitate interaction between users and systems. More speciÔ¨Åcally, with advanced technologies, the trend has been geared towards developing more intuitive devices, and one of the efforts is a gesture-based interface that recognizes any physical movement without the help of a traditional device such as a mouse or a keyboard (Saffer, 2008). Previous studies on gesture-based interfaces have focused on either 2 dimensional (2D) gestures utilizing a touch-screen controlled by a Ô¨Ånger or a stylus pen, or 3 dimensional (3D) motion-recognition systems accompanied by sensor-gloves or handheld devices. More recently, the trend of developing 3D gesture recognition technologies, such as Microsoft‚Äôs Kinect, has allowed different gesture-based interfaces to provide users with easier control of the devices without any extra equipment (Bhuiyan and Picking, 2011; Kim et al., 2011). Consequently, recent research  * Corresponding author. San 31, Hyoja-dong, Nam gu, Pohang, Gyeongbuk, Re- public of Korea. Tel.: √æ82 54 279 2192; fax: √æ82 54 279 2920.

Meanwhile, in the earlier studies, due to the limitation of the gesture recognition technologies, gesture interfaces could not recognize many postures or motions, and only a few gestures were suggested by designers or engineers based on their specialized knowledge (Buisine and Martin, 2007; O‚ÄôHagan et al., 2002; Sears and Arora, 2002). However, some of these gestures are difÔ¨Åcult to discover and adopt because they are arbitrarily associated with commands (Yee, 2009). More recently, as the image processing technology for faster computation has become possible, and subsequently the number of gesture-activated functions has increased, intuitiveness has become an important consideration in gesture design (Blackler et al., 2010; Lee et al., 2010; Lepinski et al., 2010; Park, 2012). Therefore, the issue has expanded to determining the gestures for more intuitive interaction with the products. Lately, various re- searches have started to focus on matching gestures with com- mands by involving users in the initial stage of designing gestures to fully use the users‚Äô experiences: user-centered approach (Akers, 2006; Epps et al., 2006; Grandhi et al., 2010; Henze et al., 2010; Kuhnel et al., 2011; Lee et al., 2010; Mauney et al., 2010; Mitchell and Heap, 2011; Nebelrath et al., 2011; Nielsen et al., 2003, 2004; Stern et al., 2008; Wobbrock et al., 2009). The aforementioned studies followed a similar procedure to suggest gestures for commands (Fig. 1). In such case, the frequency

The procedure of the previous studies to select a top gesture for each command.  ratio is commonly used to eliminate awkward gestures, and to select popular gestures among the users. More speciÔ¨Åcally, the users were asked to derive a gesture for each command. Once the gestures were collected from the users, similar gestures for each command were grouped together according to the physical shapes/ motions of the gestures. Then, a gesture with the highest frequency (Top gesture) was suggested as the Ô¨Ånal gesture for a command. In addition some of the gestures with high frequency for each com- mand were selected and then were estimated in terms of subjective measures such as suitability, ease of memory, and fatigue. Finally, one of them was selected as the Ô¨Ånal gesture for the command. However, these steps can introduce several issues. Firstly, users have a limited set of gesture candidates in their mind, and they end up selecting one of them as the best gesture for a command during an experiment. Therefore, if they observe other gestures that they had not thought about during the experiment, they could change their selection. Secondly, if a skilled user in designing gestures is included in a participant group; a gesture that he/she derives could be the most suitable gesture for a command. However, following the aforementioned step is likely to neglect the meaningful ges- tures due to their low frequency. However, there are no studies on these issues. Thus, we made hypothesis to identify the issues as follows.   Users may change their selection after observing other gestures.  A gesture derived from only a few users might be a better gesture.  To verify the hypothesis, two experiments were conducted. In the Ô¨Årst experiment, we followed the procedure of the previous studies: deriving gestures for a command from users and selecting a gesture with the highest frequency (Top gesture) for each com- mand. In the second experiment, we asked the same users to select the most suitable gesture for each command after observing all of the user-derived gestures acquired in the Ô¨Årst experiment, and then, selected a top gesture for each command. Moreover, the top gestures between the two experiments were compared to identify whether the top gestures in the Ô¨Årst experiment were maintained in the second experiment, and whether the gestures that a few users derived in the Ô¨Årst experiment became popular gestures. Finally, in order to verify the changed gestures between the two experiments, a third experiment including another set of partici- pants was conducted.  2. "
s0003687014000325,"  The main objective of this research was to Ô¨Ånd articles in the recent literature that discuss work (in its multiple interpretations) and sustainability (sustainable development and corporate sus- tainability) jointly, mapping the relationships between these themes. In addition, among the articles selected in this search, an analysis was made of those related to ergonomics in order to identify the current articles that link this discipline to the theme of sustainability and to discuss other possibilities (opportunities) for ergonomic actions to contribute toward sustainable work. As contribution of this study, we hope to provide a basis for reciprocal enrichment between ergonomic actions and sustainability policies. The theme of sustainability was Ô¨Årst addressed in a study published in 1713 by von Carlowitz (1732), which discussed the need to consider natural resource limitations (speciÔ¨Åcally in forestry) in the economic development of a region. Since then, the theme was addressed on other occasions and has been dissemi- nated internationally, mainly in the last four decades, through the concept of sustainable development. This concept was formally introduced in the United Nations Conference on the Human  * Corresponding author. bolis.ivan@yahoo.it laertesz@usp.br (L.I. Sznelwar).  addresses:  E-mail  M.

Environment in 1972 (Dresner, 2012), and its most widely recog- nized deÔ¨Ånition is the one proposed in 1987 by the World Com- mission on Environment and Development (WCED, 1987). By ensuring that the needs of the present generation are met without affecting the ability of future generations to meet their own, sus- tainable development can be achieved provided that environ- mental, social and economic aspects are dealt with jointly in the short, medium and long term. This concept now permeates many spheres of society, and the intentions emerging from the theme of sustainable development have led to other correlated concepts. Assumptions about sustain- ability are increasingly being adjusted and applied by individual entities such as organizations (Figge and Hahn, 2004; Gladwin et al., 1995), which in this case is called corporate sustainability (Bansal, 2005; Montiel, 2008; Steurer et al., 2005; Van Marrewijk, 2003). Corporate sustainability (CS) is a concept that emerges in companies, leading them to adopt new ways of acting. Although the concept initially focused only on environmental issues, companies‚Äô actions today encompass the three dimensions (economic, social and environmental), as proposed by the Triple Bottom Line approach (Elkington, 1997, 1994). At the same time, several ap- proaches to CS are identiÔ¨Åed in the literature. Montiel (2008) identiÔ¨Åes an approach related to ecological sustainability and the environmental dimension of business and another approach referring to the deÔ¨Ånition proposed by the WCED, also discussed by Dyllick and Hockerts (2002), including the social and  
1226  I. Bolis et al.  / Applied Ergonomics 45 (2014) 1225e1239  environmental dimensions in the approach of organizations (Cannon, 1994; Elkington, 2005, 2002; Hart, 1997; Lozano, 2012; Rondinelli and Berry, 2000). Currently, this concept is closely related to another, that of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR), which usually covers similar issues (Ebner and Baumgartner, 2006; Kleine and von Hauff, 2009; Montiel, 2008; Steurer et al., 2005; Van Marrewijk, 2003). The distinction between these two concepts is not clearly deÔ¨Åned; Kleine & von Hauff (2009) and Montiel (2008) propose that they converge to a certain extent, although they are not equivalent concepts. This deserves a deeper discussion, above all with regard to the analysis of corporate practices. This article does not analyze this distinction in depth; however, because the two concepts relate to internal issues of Ô¨Årms, the terms CS and CSR are used as equivalents in many passages. Since the advent of the sustainable development concept, the issue of work, in its different interpretations, has been included among the aspects to be upheld by mankind. Even so, the theme of work has never been central to the debate on sustainability and the issues regarding the content and organization of work have rarely been discussed, except in a few references to working conditions and decent work. Since 1972, the United Nations documents that underpin the actions of companies in the area of sustainability (UN (United Nations), 2005, 2000, 1992, 1972; WCED, 1987) have addressed issues on the theme of work (e.g., job security and sta- bility, aspects of work health and safety, and contents of the Uni- versal Declaration of Human Rights and of the Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work). For example, the Ô¨Årst and Ô¨Åfth principles of the Declaration of the United Nations Con- ference on the Human Environment proclaim that ‚Äúman is both creature and molder of his environment, which gives him physical sustenance and affords him the opportunity for intellectual, moral, social and spiritual growth. [.] Both aspects of man‚Äôs environment, the natural and the man-made, are essential to his well-being and to the enjoyment of basic human rights, the right to life itself‚Äù and ‚Äúof all things in the world, people are the most precious‚Äù (UN (United Nations), 1972), and twenty years later, the Ô¨Årst principle of the Rio Declaration proclaims that ‚Äòhuman beings are at the center of concerns for sustainable development. They are entitled to a healthy and productive life in harmony with nature‚Äô (UN (United Nations), 1992). At the Rio 92 Earth Summit it was explic- itly stated that the need to satisfy material desires should not come at the expense of generating negative impacts on health (Scott, 2008, p.498), which obviously also refers to humans in a work situations. More recently, the latest documents mention the concept of decent work, which involves the creation of employ- ment for men and women; the extension of social protection; the promotion of social dialogue; and the Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work (Ghai, 2003). The introduction of this concept proved to be especially necessary to oppose poor working condi- tions, especially in developing countries. Sweatshops are notorious cases that led to the emergence of work monitoring systems and NGOs (e.g., Fair Labor Association, Social Accountability Interna- tional, Worldwide Responsible Apparel Production, and Workers Rights Consortium) as a way of tackling issues related to poor working conditions (Block et al., 2001; Chan, 2001; O‚ÄôRourke, 2003). However, the concept of corporate sustainability is still being deÔ¨Åned according to multiple interpretations and approaches, some of which mention the theme of work and its issues explicitly (Epstein, 2008; Littig and Grie√üler, 2005; Lozano, 2013; Van Marrewijk and Werre, 2003). What currently emerges is the introduction into the routine of companies of sustainability guidelines that mention social issues (GRI, 2013; ISO, 2010; UN (United Nations), 2013) in which work-related aspects are addressed (e.g., employment and labor relations, working  conditions and social protection, social dialogue, work health and safety, human development and job training, and issues related to human rights). Lozano (2013, p. 1) argues that ‚Äúinternally, leader- ship and the business case are the most important drivers, whilst the most important external drivers are reputation, customer de- mands and expectations, and regulation and legislation,‚Äù which reinforces the need to examine work and workers. Because ergonomics is a discipline strictly related with the theme of work, it is also related with sustainability (be it sustain- able development or corporate sustainability). In the words of Haslam and Waterson (2013, p. 343) ‚ÄúThere exists, it would seem, a natural synergy between these areas [the sustainability ones] and ergonomics, with its goal of understanding and optimizing the outcomes of humanesystem interactions.‚Äù This discipline began to formally incorporate concerns about global issues of sustainability, starting in the 12th Triennial Congress of the International Ergo- nomics Association (IEA) in 1994 (Haslam and Waterson, 2013). Since then, the connections between these areas of knowledge have increased, and in 2008 the IEA established the Human Factors and Sustainable Development Technical Committee.  2. Material and methods  2.1.  Establishing the literature base  In order to structure current knowledge linking the themes of sustainability and work, a bibliographic review of academic articles in the Scopus database on themes relating to sustainability, ergo- nomics and work was made in February 2012. The set of articles was created by means of a process comprising the following steps:   Choice of keywords related to work and sustainability (Fig. 1).  Retrieval of articles from the Scopus database by means of a structured search using the predeÔ¨Åned keywords (Table 1). Only publications such as articles, articles in press, reviews, books, and business articles in English were extracted. The search Ô¨Åelds were ‚Äúall Ô¨Åelds,‚Äù except for those related exclusively to sus- tainability (S, SD and SR), to which the search for keywords was applied only in the Ô¨Åelds of ‚Äútitle, abstract and keywords.‚Äù  The title, keywords and abstracts of identiÔ¨Åed papers were read. The articles were previously classiÔ¨Åed according to their perti- nence to this study, resulting in the reÔ¨Ånement of the literature base to a subset of 167 articles.  The remaining papers were read in full for subsequent reÔ¨Åne- ment. Thus, the Ô¨Ånal literature base comprised 112 papers.  2.2. ClassiÔ¨Åcation of articles using taxonomy available in the literature  From the set of selected articles, each paper was read in full and classiÔ¨Åed by means of the following parameters:   Job type, adapted from Westgaard and Winkel (2011).  Industrial sector, based on the ‚ÄúInternational Standard Industrial ClassiÔ¨Åcation of All Economic Activities‚Äù proposed by the UN (http://unstats.un.org/unsd/cr/registry/regcst.asp?Cl¬º27).  Concept of sustainability described in each articles, which could be one or more, among: Sustainable Development (SD), Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR), Corporate Sustainability (CS), Triple Bottom Line (TBL), Environmental Sustainability (ES), Social Sustainability (SS), Economic Sustainability (ES), Stakeholder theory (STK), and Sustainability - Generic (S).  ClassiÔ¨Åcation 1, which divides articles among those that discuss: public policies and local development; theoretical; companies

In the two latter cases, the articles were subclassiÔ¨Åed among the  ClassiÔ¨Åcation 2, which divides articles according to the issues Ô¨Åve corporate systems proposed by Lozano (2012). they address about work in the context of CSR (ISO 26.000).  Abstract, the most signiÔ¨Åcant sentence from the abstract of each article, preferably related with work and sustainability.  Study design, adapted from Westgaard and Winkel (2011).  The articles were classiÔ¨Åed using a system which grouped them by similarity. However, this analysis proved unsuitable for the structured classiÔ¨Åcation of the results. Therefore, due to the difÔ¨Å- culty of Ô¨Ånding a univocal logic based on the classiÔ¨Åcations, each classiÔ¨Åcation was deÔ¨Åned at two levels, Ô¨Årstly by the theme of sustainability, with the papers divided between the ones closest to the theme of sustainable development (9 papers, one of which is a conceptual paper) and those closest to that of Corporate Sustain- ability (103 papers, 21 of which are conceptual papers); and sec- ondly by the theme of work, using an ad hoc division based on the purpose of the article. This level of analysis was organized based on the question of how the authors proposed a relationship between work and sustainability, which was answered by considering the concepts they adopted, as well as the results obtained through empirical approaches. Lastly, the themes in which the subject of ergonomics are included were identiÔ¨Åed, which revealed four di- mensions that contribute to sustainability.  3. Results  3.1.  Sustainable development and work . Main contributions  Worldwide concern about the need to introduce a more sus- tainable model of development is addressed at both a theoretical level and in case studies based on experiences in certain commu- nities, as well as with respect to public policies. Based on the contribution of nine articles, Fig. 2 summarizes the relationship between sustainable development and the theme of work. The latter plays an important role in the transition to new models of development: the worker‚Äôs participation in deÔ¨Åning sustain- ability policies (and that of communities) is essential for global sustainability (social, economic and environmental) resulting from the implementation of new policies (Reed, 2007), especially if his involvement begins in the planning phase (Nelsen et al., 2010). The beneÔ¨Åts, however, are reciprocal, since sustainability pol- icies encourage the social inclusion of all types of workers, pre- venting some of them from being marginalized or discriminated against. The case of women is a relevant one, and reproductive work (invisible) is essential for the sustainability of the future workforce of the local community (Reed, 2007). The sustainable development of a region may also include new economic activities that have positive impacts in terms of employment and income in the region (Mesquita et al., 2010). Another possible beneÔ¨Åt for the worker is the promotion of his health and safety, although decision makers of public policies generally considered this a lux- ury (Radon et al., 2010).  Moreover, another beneÔ¨Åt refers to the encouragement of a new vision about work. Related to the concept of sustainable devel- opment and the social aspects of corporate sustainability, there are authors who seek to establish the concept of ‚Äúsustainable work‚Äù. Littig and Grie√üler (2005) address work as an activity to satisfy human needs and, at the same time, as the main process of ex- change between society and nature. Accordingly, they also claim that a sustainable working society requires: 1) the ecologization of existing jobs and the creation of new environmentally healthy jobs so as to ensure the rendering of environmentally, socially and health-friendly goods and services; 2) a redistribution of all the work that needs to be done in society considering gender, so that everyone can have a sufÔ¨Åcient income from useful and publicly accepted work (for example, through shorter working hours, childcare, a work-life balance for men and women, etc.); and 3) freedom to choose, at any stage of life, between different forms of work (work arrangements, Ô¨Åeld of work) or lifestyles, always hav- ing the right to individual social security (Littig and Grie√üler, 2005). Another concept that directly connects work and sustainable development is developmental work. Hvid (2004) states that there is an interest in the relationship between developmental work and sustainable development, and proposes to unite creativity and workers‚Äô values toward a common goal: sustainability. Yet another proposed concept is green sustainable work, which is deÔ¨Åned as ‚Äújobs that have a beneÔ¨Åcial impact on the environment, provide a physically and psychosocially sound working environment and that generate a large enough revenue to cover salaries and social costs‚Äù (Klang et al., 2003, p.321). However, sustainable development policies may have negative impacts on communities and working people if the focus of sus- tainability is limited, e.g., considering only aspects of the envi- ronmental dimension (Trauger, 2007). Good planning of sustainability policies cannot exclude the consideration of social aspects. The existence of negative social impacts (also in terms of inadequate working conditions and employment relationships) may lead the local population to feel aversion toward environ- mental issues, and hence, to oppose sustainability policies (Cao et al., 2010).  3.2.  Corporate sustainability and work . Main contributions  In addition to the discourse on sustainable development, papers associated with corporate sustainability policies are discussed. The 103 articles identiÔ¨Åed in the database were divided into three blocks (one article was included in more than one block), as shown in Fig. 3. This Ô¨Ågure illustrates the reasons why the issue of work is related to corporate responsibility policies; gaps and opportunities in the current scenario of work and CS policies; and the key inÔ¨Çu- encers of the introduction of work-related CS policies in organizations.  3.2.1. Reasons why work pertains to corporate responsibility policies  The theme of work is included in the discourse of corporate sustainability motivated by different reasons. The following four

A e Effective interest  in workers. CS policies are aimed at introducing actions into organizations that jointly improve envi- ronmental, economic and social aspects. Among the latter, founded mainly upon the vision of the stakeholder theory, the worker as- sumes a relevant role as an internal stakeholder and his issues become more important (Bolton et al., 2011). Thus, together with and in addition to HR policies, the inclusion of direct beneÔ¨Åts for workers can be found as a policy of responsibility of the company (Moon, 2007). This includes promoting better work-life balance (Moon, 2007), health and safety (Venverloh, 2007), the develop- ment of his character, skills, morality and values by means of, for example, volunteer work (Gray, 2010) and, more generally, the consideration of working conditions (Klang et al., 2003). In the workplace, the goal is to maximize people‚Äôs well-being, involving workers in a man-centered CSR, fostering relationships that go beyond the Ô¨Ånancial relationship (Kimmet, 2007), and beyond the usual productivity goals (Bryer, 2010). In this context, the directors must change their attitude by shifting from a bureaucratic and procedural logic to an interpretive logic, thereby improving their relations with employees (Lehman, 2007). These aspects can be inserted by means of Management Systems that introduce actions of sustainability not only of an environmental nature in organiza- tions (Klang et al., 2003; Venverloh, 2007), such as Human Re- sources Management based on the concept of sustainability  such as  the Social Life  (Schlotzhauer, 2011) or speciÔ¨Åc modules Cycle Attribute (Andrews et al., 2009). The worker‚Äôs interest is also visible when one analyzes speciÔ¨Åc social aspects of sustainability. A case in point is the discussion about the issue of sustainability of organizations from the stand- point of the energy spent by the worker himself and the strategies he uses at work to keep up his energy (Fritz et al., 2011). These aspects can be considered by companies to help their employees maintain their own energy at work. According to Manuaba (2007), ergonomics encourages global sustainability through the presence of more humane companies, i.e., healthier, safer, more comfortable and efÔ¨Åcient, and the pro- motion of well-being at work is one of the goals of companies in the context of the discourse about sustainability (Randelin et al., 2011). Ergonomics acts in convergence with sustainability objectives, minimizing work-related stress and promoting the health and safety of workers (Jain et al., 2011; Metzner and Fischer, 2010; Purnawati, 2007; Wreder and Klefsj√∂, 2007; Wreder, 2007). Considering health in business policies makes it possible to ensure ‚Äúsustainable production systems.‚Äù The latter is deÔ¨Åned as ‚Äúthe joint consideration of competitive performance and working conditions in a long term perspective‚Äù (Westgaard and Winkel, 2011).  3.2.1.2.  B e Increase  the organization‚Äôs performance. The goal of  companies in the market is to maximize their own Ô¨Ånancial returns, and economic and Ô¨Ånancial sustainability is generally the most relevant dimension of CS. Based on this vision, the introduction of CS can be seen as an opportunity to further enhance the organi- zation‚Äôs performance (Sarkar, 2008). In this context, companies are also acting on the human ‚Äúresource‚Äù for two main reasons:  -  Importance of beneÔ¨Åts for workers. Many articles argue that the organization‚Äôs performance can be boosted by adopting socially responsible behavior, for example, by improving work- ing conditions and addressing human rights issues. According to Ogrin and Kralj (2009), work pleasant and stimulating envi- ronments, the promotion of relaxing activities, job satisfaction, transparency in communication, and satisfaction such as coop- eration with coworkers, can lead to greater employee motiva- tion and a consequent increase in the organization‚Äôs performance. In this context, Kralj (2009) argues that system thinking can be deployed, creating a more open organizational culture focused on job satisfaction (with a pleasant and stimu- lating environment, with incentives for cooperation and more motivating activities) that enable the achievement of excellent  SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT  Worker participation  in defining  sustainability policies  Social inclusion of all types of workers   Positive impacts in terms of employment  and income  Promotion of health and safety   New vision about work   Critical situations  Negative impacts if  the focus of  sustainability is limited  WORK  Fig. 2.

According to Pajo and Lee (2011), also promoting volunteerism within the context of corporate sustainability can lead to great advantages in the organization by creating a pos- itive and pro-social corporate identity, with all the related beneÔ¨Åts of greater altruism in the organization, ultimately motivating and engaging workers (Gray, 2010; Pajo and Lee, 2011). Liu et al. (2010), in turn, argue that creating conditions for workers to participate in decisions can help companies motivate employees, encourage group work, and promote pro- ductivity and innovation. Moreover, Jarventaus (2007) adds the possibility that these actions also lead to greater economic and environmental beneÔ¨Åts. According to Ansett (2007), introducing corporate sustainability can help, for instance, to reduce costs, generate product, process and strategy innovations, obtain operating permits and reduce internal and external conÔ¨Çicts. With regard to the implementation of lean production (as a way of having more qualiÔ¨Åed and productive workers), Mefford (2011) identiÔ¨Åes beneÔ¨Åts such as higher quality and greater ef- Ô¨Åciency and a joint reduction of labor claims. According to Lehmann et al. (2010), CS enables the company to become more dynamic and innovative, particularly in changing contexts. Finally, in the speciÔ¨Åc case of the presence of impaired re- lationships within organizations, a board engaged in CS can prevent the organization‚Äôs well-being and survival from being compromised (Lehman, 2007). The role of ergonomics in com- panies in the context of corporate sustainability can contribute to augment the organization‚Äôs performance. A study involving ergonomics (Metzner and Fischer, 2010) highlighted how greater consideration of the opinions of workers in the planning  and implementation of CSR-related projects can contribute to improve the organization‚Äôs performance. Moreover, one of the possible beneÔ¨Åts of introducing ergonomics into sustainability policies is the considerable reduction in health care costs and the retention of highly qualiÔ¨Åed workers (Genaidy et al., 2009a). Another concept associated with ergonomics is business sus- tainability, for which human performance is a critical factor to improve and maintain corporate health (Genaidy et al., 2010, 2009b). Other articles related to ergonomics and discussed in the previous section include, besides effective interest in the worker, the increase in the organization‚Äôs performance as a motivator for the inclusion of attention to workers in corporate sustainability policies (Manuaba, 2007; Metzner and Fischer, 2010; Purnawati, 2007; Randelin et al., 2011; Westgaard and Winkel, 2011; Wreder and Klefsj√∂, 2007; Wreder, 2007). - Control over workers‚Äô conduct and actions. One of the possible results of introducing CS in the company is that it al- lows for greater control over social aspects, particularly over workers, both positive and negative. Two types of control of workers‚Äô conduct and actions were identiÔ¨Åed: over the workers‚Äô representatives and over the conduct of workers. In the Ô¨Årst case, the use of CS (particularly of codes of conduct and non- Ô¨Ånancial reports) may be aimed at building a relationship of trust between management and ‚Äúthe labor union movement‚Äù (Egels-Zand√©n, 2009a; Johansen, 2010). In the second case, a few cases were identiÔ¨Åed. The promotion of health (proposed in the CSR) may be closely tied to an idea of control over the conduct and actions of workers, which shapes the attitudes and behavior of workers according to the company‚Äôs rules and values  
1230  I. Bolis et al.  / Applied Ergonomics 45 (2014) 1225e1239  (Holmqvist, 2009). CS policies can help workers adopt a more positive attitude, e.g., to adverse changes such as the occurrence of downsizing and worker layoffs (Svensen et al., 2007). Codes of conduct (with ILO principles considered only marginally) are necessary for the company to ensure the application of princi- ples that favor it and to protect its assets, ensuring that the knowledge of workers is fully incorporated by the company (B√©thoux et al., 2007). Moreover, in case of permanent restruc- turing, the top-down introduction of CSR represented an ad hoc tool created to increase the dominant position of managers in imposing their will on other stakeholders (Bonvin, 2007).  3.2.1.3.  C e Improve the corporate image. Although the corporate  image can be related with increased organizational performance, being a sustainable company allows it to gain greater approval from its stakeholders, thus achieving its economic goals more easily. Two groups of articles that discuss this topic were found.  - Concern about the company image (potential and current) perceived by workers. CS policies have a positive impact, above all on the attraction and retention of the best workers (Ansett, 2007; Doh et al., 2011; Liu et al., 2010; Moon, 2007; Smith and Langford, 2011). Companies are increasingly aware that in their choices of jobs, people, particularly those with a higher educational level (postgraduates, for instance), consider the company‚Äôs reputation relevant, including its social re- sponsibility and its involvement in its own community (Moon, 2007). - Concern about the company image (potential and current) perceived by the community (especially customers). In this case, there are three possibilities. The Ô¨Årst involves competitive advantage. When international brands are driven to adopt CSR policies in response to external pressures from consumers or organized movements, they manage to distance themselves from a history of irresponsibility and gain preference in pur- chasing by consumers who are becoming more aware. In general, workers beneÔ¨Åt from this situation (Ansett, 2007; Bennett and Lagos, 2007; Doorey, 2011). Moreover, a more proactive stance by workers, resulting from their increased satisfaction due to the introduction of effective CSR policies, and greater participation in the organization‚Äôs CSR decisions enables companies to gain legitimacy and to sustain their identity as a ‚Äúgood company‚Äù more effectively (Bolton et al., 2011; Liu et al., 2010; Moon, 2007). The second involves corporate irresponsibility. Companies can develop CSR pro- grams aiming to conceal their real environmental and health costs from their clients. In such cases, the CSR projects produce very limited beneÔ¨Åts that allow such companies essentially to continue engaging in their traditional practices (Ota√±ez and Glantz, 2011). On the other hand, when the company in- troduces CSR actions to obtain marketing approval, it is difÔ¨Åcult to convince the workers of the value and authenticity of such social alignment (Yang and Malone, 2008). The third is about shaping the meaning of a responsible company. In cases of adverse impacts on workers, such as worker layoffs, actions associated with CSR (e.g., offering training to laid-off workers to help them Ô¨Ånd a new job) can help an organization strengthen its position as a socially responsible company. Un- like the proposal of stakeholder theory, companies act from a privileged position, inÔ¨Çuencing, shaping and transforming the intentions of the stakeholders themselves, creating a network of actors loyal to the company‚Äôs own deÔ¨Ånition of what it means to be socially responsible (Bergstrom and Diedrich, 2011).  3.2.1.4. D e Work for  Introducing sustainability at companies may mean that workers must change their own work or the way they work. Several points were identiÔ¨Åed:  sustainability.  -  -  Importance of workers in the implementation of sustainability (if solely environmental or global). Sustainability (or adequate management systems) cannot exist without workers that sup- port it (Winter and Burn, 2010). In the implementation of organizational CSR processes, the growing involvement of workers over time can be a vital factor for success (Bolton et al., 2011; Zorpas, 2010). Introducing CS can cause additional work. When Management Systems are introduced speciÔ¨Åcally to improve environmental aspects, the role of workers is to make signiÔ¨Åcant efforts to develop the practices needed for these programs to permeate all the company‚Äôs processes (Fricke, 2009; Van Calker et al., 2007). However, a similar case of such indicators may result in addi- tional work for workers (Ogrin and Kralj, 2009). - Change in work to support environmental sustainability. The work environment, workers, work and lifestyle will change in the future as a result of the shift toward greater sustainability (above all environmental) by companies. Workers will work more broadly, in different environments and for different pur- poses (Tomlinson, 2010). - New competencies required of the worker. Workers will have to become innovative in the way they develop and manufacture products, provide services and conduct business (Arnaud and Williams, 2010; Vavik and Keitsch, 2010; Zorpas, 2010). They will have to increase their competencies and skills (McMahon and Bhamra, 2012), change their habits, knowledge, attitudes and social norms (Winter and Burn, 2010), and increase their mutual cooperation, facilitating the adoption of principles of environmental protection and preservation (Akiyama, 2010). Furthermore, companies will have to train workers and change the corporate culture in order to increase workers‚Äô involvement (Jarventaus, 2007). - Creation of new types of work (or modiÔ¨Åcations in the scope of some types). Greater engagement in sustainability (particu- larly environmental) creates new types of work or modiÔ¨Åes existing ones. The case of social work was found among the articles selected for this study. Before the advent of corporate sustainability, this is how organizations dealt with the issue of social responsibility without it leading to structural changes. One of the main reasons why Industrial Social Work failed was because value (‚ÄúproÔ¨Åt‚Äù) for corporations was not added (Sarkar, 2008). This problem was solved with the introduction of CSR, which companies use as a corporate strategy to gain reputa- tion, reduce the pressures of civil society organizations, and conserve the barriers against the entry of others in a devel- oping world market (Sarkar, 2008). This evolution has resulted in a change in the work of this type of worker (Sarkar, 2008). Social workers today may still play an important role, but their involvement in corporate sustainability policies is questionable (Boehm, 2009). Due to the characteristics of their profession (interdisciplinary), social workers can seek greater ‚Äúenviron- mental and social justice.‚Äù This requires a new form of action in the work of the social worker, and must interconnect concerns regarding the environment, human rights and justice, and quality of human life, and the issues of peace, war and natural disasters (Schmitz et al., 2012). Norton (2011) identiÔ¨Åes the need for the social worker to consider social and environ- mental perspectives jointly, since both of them deal with jus- tice and relationships. Social workers can play the role of facilitators (in multi-stakeholder training programs in the workplace) in the implementation of corporate codes (related  
I. Bolis et al.  / Applied Ergonomics 45 (2014) 1225e1239  1231  to labor rights) and, hence, in the improvement of workers well-being (Ngai and Angelina, 2011). - Workers help in the design of CS policies. Worker motiva- tion is one of the main causes for the introduction of social responsibility, and there could be no efÔ¨Åcient and authentic CSR without considering workers (Ligeti and Oravecz, 2009). Their participation, which is considered essential in the implementation of CSR policies, can be taken into consider- ation by the Corporate Board through trade unions and the HR department (Huse et al., 2009; Preuss et al., 2009). The involvement of these social actors, from the early stages of such initiatives, can lead to major advantages: on the one hand, it can enable the initiatives to reach a higher degree of sustainability (Levitt, 2007), and on the, it can shape the meaning, interpretation and implementation of CSR, since it is an emergent is not yet fully formed concept (Preuss et al., 2009). Before they can play an active role in CSR, however, they must gain internal legitimacy in the company (Preuss et al., 2009).  3.2.2. Gaps and opportunities  Corporate sustainability policies are not always effective on is- sues related to workers, presenting numerous gaps and/or oppor- tunities. The following gaps and/or opportunities were found in the 37 articles in this block:  - Protection of the most vulnerable classes of workers. The current deregulation of the labor market, particularly at the level of international supply chains, is harming mainly the most vulnerable workforce categories, especially female (Pearson, 2007; Prieto-Carr√≥n, 2008), informal (Barrientos, 2008) and foreigner workers (Crinis, 2010). It is advisable for society and the corporations that employ such workers to also extend their protection to these categories. - Limited applications of sustainability can have negative ef- fects on workers. When companies focus on greener operations, it is possible that work health and safety indicators and working conditions worsen or fail to be considered, as in the case of green building (Rajendran et al., 2009), organic cotton farming (Bitzer and Glasbergen, 2010), car dismantling (Kazmierczak et al., 2005) and more sustainable (Pilgeram, 2011; Trauger, 2007) or local agriculture (Cross et al., 2009). There are also cases of professions whose work involves achieving greater environmental sustainability, but which do not gain any social status or recognition by society, receiving only negative impacts on their health and that of their work environment, e.g., trash scavengers (Deb and Welling, 2010) and waste management and recycling workers (Klang et al., 2003). This can also be the case if the focus is exclusively on Ô¨Ånancial sustainability. Cases of Ô¨Ånancial restructuring can lead to a decline in employee bene- Ô¨Åts, wage freezes, increased working hours, use of part-time workers, expansion of work tasks, encouragement of older employees to retire, and cooperation with other agencies to share employees (Buehler and Pucher, 2011), creating negative externalities even for outside workers and the local community (Demaria, 2010). Lastly, there is a similar risk when companies focus only on certain aspects of social sustainability (Kira and Van Eijnatten, 2010, 2008), since the decision to ensure the improvement of societal aspects may, for instance, result in an increased workload on the workers involved (Van Calker et al., 2007). - There are transnational governance issues that must be solved. In the context of international supply chains (ISCs) there is a problem of Transnational Governance of Workers‚Äô Rights. Due to the emergence of transnational corporations, it is  no longer as effective to have collective bargaining and in- dustrial agreements between companies and unions, in the speciÔ¨Åc context of each national government and of hard law based on international labor regulations (Tsogas, 2009). The governance of labor relations is weakening in favor of such corporations (Egels-Zand√©n, 2009a). According to Tsogas (2009), other strategies besides hard laws, such as the soft regulatory approach and CSR, are still ambiguous and must overcome many challenges to become effective. To achieve consolidated improvements, it is necessary for multinational companies, along with the governments of host countries, in- dustry associations, trade unions, NGOs and local businesses, to improve the institutional environment of each emerging mar- ket, including its legal and ethical framework (Tan, 2009; Tsogas, 2009). - Cultural aspects and business strategies must be considered. Improving work related aspects also involves being knowl- edgeable about the social aspects of each culture (Vachon, 2010) and the strategies of each company, which differ (Park and Dickson, 2008). - Health & safety policies should be improved. One of the shortcomings found in the CSR policies inherent to the improvement of workers conditions is the deepening of the link between CSR (which is strategic) and the management of psy- chosocial risks (Jain et al., 2011), health and job security (Sarkis et al., 2010). - Weakness of business instruments for work sustainability. The introduction of CSR policies, particularly those related to work, in the ISC context, clearly shows some limitations (Frynas, 2008). Dispelling some myths, Lund-Thomsen (2008) argues that CSR policies are not widespread in developing countries, and few global sourcing companies and their suppliers are engaged and prioritize them. Moreover, it is a fallacy to assume that if suppliers in developing countries comply with codes of conduct, they will improve workers‚Äô conditions and reduce environmental pollution. Lastly, audit actions and the exclusion of suppliers that fail to comply with CSR policies do not always help to improve worker conditions and respect for the envi- ronment. Frynas (2008) also points out four main criticisms of CSR: (1) lack of empirical evidence, (2) presence of analytical limitations of CSR, (3) cases of business constraints in the implementation of CSR, and (4) unresolved governance issues. An important aspect to be considered which limits the effec- tiveness of CSR policies (including especially the codes of conduct) is its top-down and unilateral vision (B√©thoux et al., 2007; Egels-Zand√©n, 2009b; Johansen, 2010; Merk, 2009). In addition to the criticism of the voluntariness of such programs, which already constitutes a structural constraint (BlowÔ¨Åeld and Dolan, 2010, 2008), there is a gap between ethical intentions (imposed mainly by Western culture) and the realities and needs of the beneÔ¨Åciaries (in this case, their workers). One criticism in particular is directed at the in- dicators, which have not been deÔ¨Åned in theory or in practice, and are still disconnected from one another (Kleine and von Hauff, 2009). For workers, institutional arrangements estab- lished in the workplace are more important and effective than non-Ô¨Ånancial reports (such as those on sustainability) as a way to demand, receive and develop accountability regarding organizational issues (Johansen, 2010; Turker, 2009). One of the keys to effective CSR as a tool for labor market regulation is to extend negotiation power to all stakeholders of the company, among which the workers are to be considered. They can enrich these policies (Lund, 2004), and be a critical factor for their effective implementation (Bonvin, 2007; Ligeti and Oravecz, 2009).  per  se  
1232  I. Bolis et al.  / Applied Ergonomics 45 (2014) 1225e1239  3.2.3.  InÔ¨Çuencers of  the introduction of CS policies regarding work  Companies may decide to introduce CS actions based on internal policies, but also in response to the inÔ¨Çuence of an external stakeholder (as mentioned earlier in the discussion about the four motivators). This block comprised 14 articles. Starting from an overview, Park-Poaps and Rees (2010) studied four types of stake- holders (consumers, regulation, industry and media) and their impact in providing fair working conditions. Regulatory forces, through national laws, for instance, did not prove to be a signiÔ¨Åcant variable in the improvement of working conditions. Going into detail, some contributions were found about groups of stakeholders:  three  - Transactional networking, NGOs and trade unions. With respect to three types of monitoring of working conditions and labor rights in developing countries, Wells (2007) discusses the major Ô¨Çaws and structural limitations in regulations centered on recommendations from NGOs (soft law). Even so, the political economy of labor comprising labor struggles in their political and historical context must be considered for the actions of trade unions, NGOs and corporate interventions to be successful (Neve, 2008). Because companies have taken advantage of the possibility of spatially increasing outsourcing and of outsourcing their production (which has undermined the traditional stra- tegies that work has used to protect itself against exploitation), there could also be a great opportunity for workers to achieve their own rights in the expansion of their struggle to a broader (in space), even international level (Merk, 2009). Coordinated transnational projects may offer a great potential for change in the working conditions of whole groups of workers, such as the defense of women‚Äôs rights (Hale and Wills, 2007). Although transnational networking has been encouraged, top-down ac- tions should not be introduced. If one considers that the pres- ence of external pressures is necessary for better labor standards, one must also consider the independence and cen- trality of local institutions of the sector and of local collective actions in the implementation of CSR policies, particularly in less visible supply chains whose brands are little known inter- nationally (Lund-thomsen and Nadvi, 2010). Industry peer e supplier behavior. In discussions about the international supply chain, one of the thorniest issues is the deÔ¨Ånition of the corporate responsibilities of multinationals for the actions of their partners (Mares, 2010). There are misguided economic incentives for international suppliers to reduce their compliance with work-related CSR codes while maintaining a semblance of compliance. The workers themselves have eco- nomic incentives and a punitive system that drives them to accept such practices (Egels-Zand√©n, 2007). Some solutions are: to establish respect for codes of conduct as a minimum requirement in purchase decisions, build closer relationships with suppliers, and change the monitoring of suppliers, increasing employee participation in monitoring codes of conduct (Egels-Zand√©n, 2007). For Boyd et al. (2007), CSR ini- tiatives should not be imposed on the supply chain itself or controlled by large-scale monitoring. Trust and transparency should be built to improve supplier compliance and to avoid endangering buyer-supplier relationships. The costs of improving labor standards should be shared among the main actors in the global supply chain to preclude the emergence of harmful cases. If the costs are not shared, suppliers without bargaining power may be forced to impose more high-paced work on the workers themselves, and at lower wages, in order to generate a higher proÔ¨Åt margin (Yu, 2008). As discussed at the macro level (Vachon, 2010), the cultural aspect must also be taken into account. Companies with inventory control, image  -  differentiation and emphasis on strategic product development have been more engaged in partnerships with companies and well developed CSR policies, while companies that emphasize lower prices are less engaged in partnership relations (Park and Dickson, 2008). - Media. Islam (2010) demonstrates that large multinational companies with supply chains linked to developing countries seem to respond to the adverse attention of the media, pro- ducing greater positive social impacts, especially on issues that attract the highest negative media attention, such as precarious work conditions. Internal inÔ¨Çuencers. People and departments inside organi- zations can motivate the introduction of principles of sustain- ability in the company‚Äôs policies. This may be the case of ergonomics, which, by upholding sustainability policies, helps reverse the current situation characterized by global inequality (Scott, 2008).  -  4. Discussion  The relationships between the themes of sustainability and work are mapped in Fig. 4, based on the analysis of the results of the literature search. In this Ô¨Ågure, simpliÔ¨Åed Fig. 2 was introduced at the intersection between SD and work, and simpliÔ¨Åed Fig. 3 at the intersection between CS and work. ‚ÄúGaps and Opportunities‚Äù were considered to underpin the discussion about the relationship be- tween work and sustainability. Within the ambit of sustainability, according to the classiÔ¨Åcation established in this study, discourses on sustainable development and corporate sustainability (including CSR) were distinguished, considering CS as an application of SD in- side organizations. CS may consist of the realization and inclusion of SD concepts in organizations, but it may also consist of functional appropriations (e.g., partial) of the needs of organizations, far removed from the original discourse of SD (for this reason, we believe that CS is not contained in its entirety in SD, as shown in Fig. 4). SD and CS include issues other than work, and vice versa.  4.1. Work and sustainable development  The relationship between sustainable development and work is one of mutual beneÔ¨Åts. Sustainable development includes social aspects among its goals, and work and the worker are fundamental. Likewise, work can also beneÔ¨Åt sustainable development, since workers are active agents in society. Therefore, a real imple- mentation of sustainable development will also include work- related issues and the changes in work for the world‚Äôs entire population. Looking at a broader context, it is necessary to identify the speciÔ¨Åc needs of each region of the globe to identify social and environmental issues that are seriously impacted while simulta- neously impacting the way work is done. In extreme conditions, e.g., conditions of poverty and hunger, this situation must be dealt with in an integrated manner, avoiding work in precarious condi- tions and that disrespect human rights, and that generate signiÔ¨Å- cant negative environmental impacts resulting from extractivism, which is generally the form of subsistence of these populations. It is a complex issue, since this situation is related directly or indirectly to an international supply chain that often takes advantage of it, at least from the Ô¨Ånancial standpoint. Another element to be considered is the groups of workers without representation, who are generally marginalized or forgotten. Once can cite the case of domestic workers, particularly in developing countries, who are at the mercy of moral and sexual harassment, long working hours, and lack of formal employment (and therefore the right to social security).

Relationships found between the themes of sustainability and work.  Moreover, the decision for new production sites should also be considered in the light of concepts of sustainable development. Although it generates signiÔ¨Åcant economic development in the region, there are social issues that should not be ignored, such as the quality of workers‚Äô housing and support structures offered (for recreation and social interaction), attention to work-life balance (by providing periodic opportunities to return to their families), not to mention avoiding the encouragement of more perverse social is- sues such as people trafÔ¨Åcking for forced labor in conditions similar to slavery. The challenge is to consider all these issues, which, in a context of sustainable development, can no longer be ignored.  sustainable development. The introduction of CS in organizations is often strictly linked to economic motivations, and sustainable development goals are shaped according to business objectives. This is also the case of the subject of ‚Äúwork‚Äù: some elements exist (e.g., increased control of worker conduct and actions and partially improvement of the corporate image) that consider only the eco- nomic goal, in detriment to the objectives of the social and envi- ronmental dimensions. In addition, gaps and opportunities were identiÔ¨Åed that should be considered to enable the achievement of shared beneÔ¨Åts in the relationship between SD and work, and also to ensure that work is effectively addressed in CS policies.  4.2. Work and corporate sustainability  4.3. Work , sustainability, and the contributions of ergonomics  With regard to corporate sustainability (and CSR), work is one of the key issues, driven mainly by two aspects. The Ô¨Årst aspect de- rives from the fact that the main goal of CS is to introduce the discourse of sustainable development in the corporate environ- ment, where the shift toward greater care of workers is gaining strength. In addition to complying with national labor laws, com- panies are expected to proactively introduce voluntary policies to further improve work practices and to permanently eliminate threats to workers‚Äô rights. Since this is an expectation of society, those who can inÔ¨Çuence the effective introduction of CS policies are, above all, actors external to companies, but also internal actors. The second aspect has to do with the tendency, in recent years, for companies to take better care of workers. People and their work are fundamental to the success or failure of the economic activities of organizations; hence, relations with them should be managed and improved. With this vision, in the introduction of CS in corporate policies, efforts are made to align the discourse of sus- tainability with the companies‚Äô own motivations. This may lead to corporate sustainability actions that are inconsistent with the aims of sustainable development, as when sustainability is used for functional purposes, maximizing exclusively the company‚Äôs eco- nomic aspects (e.g., control of workers‚Äô conduct and actions and concealment of cases of non-sustainability or negative externalities caused by partial sustainability). In Fig. 4, we consider the action of corporate sustainability not fully included in the discourse of  In this context, there is ample space for ergonomics to contribute actively to the discourse of sustainability with respect to the theme of work. During the literature review, the theme of sustainability appeared in some issues. In addition to the articles that used the term sustainability to indicate the need for this discipline to continue contributing through actions aimed at pro- moting health in organizations (Caple, 2010; Punnett et al., 2009; Scott, 2008), which were excluded from the Ô¨Ånal selection because they do not explicitly discuss the sustainability-work relationship, the topic of ergonomics was identiÔ¨Åed in three places:  e As an ally to achieve positive beneÔ¨Åts for workers‚Äô well-being. e As an ally to achieve the goal of enhancing the performance of organizations. e As one of the possible inÔ¨Çuencers for work to be considered in corporate sustainability policies.  The structured analysis of the texts and places where ergo- nomics was found may allow for the deÔ¨Ånition of four possible Ô¨Åelds of action of ergonomics within the discourse of sustainability related with work (Fig. 5):  e DeÔ¨Ånition of the concept of sustainable work. Making work- ing conditions evolve so that they are adaptable to individuals throughout their life is a question of both sustainability and  
1234  I. Bolis et al.  / Applied Ergonomics 45 (2014) 1225e1239  ergonomics. It is necessary to address the causes of the most prevalent issues, avoiding mitigative actions. Of course health and well-being programs are necessary and positive, e.g., encouraging physical exercise (Bridger et al., 2013), but these programs should also include aspects directly related to work content. The same applies to work and worker-related issues, in which organizational performance should be evenly balanced with the health and well-being of workers in a broader sense (Dul et al., 2012). In addition to physical demands involving disorders and diseases of the body, there are also psychological demands, for which the content of the task, deÔ¨Ånition of the pace of production, the division of tasks, the goals to be ach- ieved, and other organizational aspects also are crucial, espe- cially for building health. One could also include the impact of the work environment on creativity (Lukersmith and Burgess- Limerick, 2013). In the corporate environment (ofÔ¨Åces), for instance, despite adequate environmental characteristics (tem- perature, noise, anthropometry and biomechanics), an increasing number of people suffer from mental disorders (Harnois and Gabriel, 2000; Houtman and Kompier, 2011). However, in these environments there are also psychosomatic disorders, i.e., pathologically unrelated to physical causes. Health is tied to cognitive demands (Falzon, 2004; Hollnagel, 1997; Montmollin, 1990) or even to organizational constraints (Westgaard and Winkel, 2011). This fact makes it a challenge for ergonomics to shed light on the relationship between cause and effect, since these relationships are becoming increasingly qualitative and subtle (e.g., a reduction in absenteeism cannot be positive) (Kleine and von Hauff, 2009). In addition, there is the challenge of measuring the cost beneÔ¨Åt of action in ergo- nomics (Beevis and Slade, 2003), especially in this context. Many of these elements are generally invisible, and as such, are dis- regarded by management and treated as externalities (Hubault and Tertre du, 2008). In addition, the fact that the deÔ¨Ånition of criteria for social sustainability is not yet Ô¨Årmly established (Hasle and Jensen, 2012) clearly indicates the complexity and the need for a broader vision about health and quality of life  (Dekker et al., 2013). Ergonomics can provide supporting evi- dence on issues of the internal social dimension of corporate sustainability, mainly as it pertains to decisions that impact the organization of work (e.g., division of tasks, content, pace, goals, evaluation), pinpointing the factors that lead to an integrated vision of performance and health from a long-term perspective, which goes beyond legal issues and beneÔ¨Åts not only manage- ment but also workers, and hence, society (Zink, 2006). From the perspective of designing sustainable work systems (Zink, 2013), a reality of work from the standpoint of sustainability must recognize and avoid pressures and constraints that are harmful to the health (physical and mental) of a team, an area or even an organization. With regard to mental health, the most recent contributions of the psychodynamics of work have brought new concepts and perspectives for action with regard to improvements in work organization (Dejours, 2009; Lancman et al., 2007). e Joint increase in organizational performance and worker well-being. Although there are different deÔ¨Ånitions of ergo- nomics (Wogalter et al., 1998), which often overlap (Wilson, 2000), some of its aspects are more emphasized. Ergonomics is considered a multidisciplinary Ô¨Åeld of science (Westgaard and Winkel, 1997), which seeks knowledge about human charac- teristics for the design of systems (Parsons, 2000), focusing on human-machine systems (Beevis and Slade, 2003), analyzing a variety of demands or specializations such as physical, cognitive and organizational requirements (Karwowski, 2005), consid- ering both physical and psychological human aspects (Dul and Neumann, 2009) in order to enable productive, safe, comfort- able, and effective human use (Chapanis, 1995) in a holistic approach (Wilson, 2013). The International Ergonomics Associ- ation deÔ¨Ånes ergonomics (or human factors) as ‚Äúthe scientiÔ¨Åc discipline concerned with the understanding of the interactions among humans and other elements of a system, and the pro- fession that applies theoretical principles, data and methods to design in order to optimize human well being and overall sys- tem performance‚Äù (IEA_Council, 2000).

I. Bolis et al.  / Applied Ergonomics 45 (2014) 1225e1239  1235  results must be achieved in two main spheres (Daniellou, 1996; Falzon, 2004): one centered on the organization and its per- formance (productivity, efÔ¨Åciency, reliability, quality, etc.), and the other on people (safety, health, comfort, ease of use, well- being, etc.). These two goals are in tension, and the role of er- gonomics is to counterbalance them, since prioritizing only productivity (and efÔ¨Åciency) as the main objective may have negative impacts on the other sphere (Iida, 1990). Thus, ergo- nomics emerges as a vital discipline for jointly augmenting the organization‚Äôs performance and worker well-being from the standpoint of corporate sustainability, particularly when one considers that the production system (subsystem) must ensure the overall sustainability of the larger system (Fischer and Zink, 2012). Even in situations of partial corporate sustainability (economic), the consideration of work issues leads to winewin situations, because better conditions for workers later gives rise to economic beneÔ¨Åts (Dul and Neumann, 2009; Hendrick, 2003; Iida, 1990). However, as Hasle and Jensen (2012) argue, a global supply chain makes it very difÔ¨Åcult to implement what is already recognized in the context of ergonomics, i.e., to protect workers from occupational hazards and ensure their right to experience well-being at work. Moreover and increasingly, there are issues that need to be addressed which have always been part of the concerns of ergonomics, such as the adequacy of work to widely diverse populations, including the issue of aging and sex, and the inclusion of people with special needs in the world of work (B√©guin, 2006; Carayon, 2006; Imada, 2005; Kogi, 2006; Rabardel and Beguin, 2005). In particular, activity- centered ergonomics (Daniellou and Rabardel, 2005; Daniellou, 2005), through ergonomic analysis (F. Gu√©rin et al., 2001; Wisner, 1995a, 1995b), meets this dual objective (orga- nization and people), considering health in a broader sense as a dynamic process (Dejours, 1986). As a contribution to corporate sustainability, the concepts of activity-centered ergonomics, particularly because it considers human work activity as one of the cornerstones of any project, especially those focused on sustainability, allows for work (in the sense of action) not to be an adjustment variable to be considered only when virtually everything is already deÔ¨Åned (Gu√©rin et al., 2001; Hubault, 2005; Noulin, 1992; Terssac and Maggi, 1996). e Support for work-related changes and new needs arising from sustainability. The introduction of sustainability in orga- nizations, especially environmental ones, implies changes in processes (goods or service), and hence, in work (Horberry et al., 2013). In this context, in activity-centered ergonomics, work is the protagonist of production and is an essential element to be considered in the analysis of the production process, from the standpoint of sustainability. New processes are created or adapted for better environmental performance (e.g., reduced resource consumption and waste minimization, etc.). A new way of measuring work is needed, which may even render it more complex through the introduction of new technologies (Rasmussen, 2000), such as green technology, for example. Regardless of the characteristics that will be optimized, and however automated the new process may be, there will always be new work to be done, with new content, challenges and constraints, which the worker must deal with and to which he will have to give his all. These changes involve not only physical ones, generating more or fewer movements and efforts, but also cognitive changes, since new information is required for the decision-making process so that production can proceed with the expected efÔ¨Åciency and effectiveness (Marmaras and Kontogiannis, 2001; Marmaras and Pavard, 1999), including the requirements for new competencies (Montmollin, 1990). It is therefore important to consider activity-centered ergonomics as  an agent, as the protagonist of action. Hence, to ensure a con- dition of corporate sustainability, it is of utmost importance to ascertain whether an environmentally or economically sus- tainable process causes an impact on the workers, and to determine what the worker must do to make this process possible. This analysis beneÔ¨Åts greatly from the contributions of ergonomics (Hanson, 2013; Ryan and Wilson, 2013) e even in situations of environmental sustainability (Thatcher, 2013), which could further broaden the concept of sustainability (Zink and Fischer, 2013). e Active inÔ¨Çuencer within the organization concerning work improvement issues. The Ô¨Åeld of action of ergonomics is in companies, and it can be described as a proactive discipline in the introduction and discussion of work-related sustainability policies. Ergonomics acts not only in solving speciÔ¨Åc problems in deÔ¨Åned situations but can also be used as a tool to achieve the organizational goals discussed in the previous section throughout the organization. Macroergonomics, in particular, encompasses broader aspects based on the idea that changes in organizational aspects, especially at the strategic level, also have a strong impact on speciÔ¨Åc work situations (Zink, 2000). Hendrick (1991) and Hendrick and Kleiner (2001) deÔ¨Åne mac- roergonomics as a top-down socio-technical approach to the design of work systems, aligning microsystem interfaces with macrosystem interfaces. Its Ô¨Åeld of action is in the design and optimization of work systems focusing on the interaction be- tween organization, technology and work system (Kleiner, 2004). Macroergonomics applications can be of different types, such as introducing cognitive mapping (Village et al., 2013), ergonomics committee (Acosta and Morales, 2008; Torma-Krajewski et al., 2007), intervention programs (Herrera and Huatuco, 2011), etc. Because its goals are aligned with those of the social dimension of work sustainability in organi- zations, the actions of macroergonomics (through different types of applications) developed in close contact with the strategic summit of organizations can align the organization‚Äôs strategic objectives with those of ergonomics, and hence, with those of sustainability. Employee participation can be strong point for the issues they experience to be incorporated into the decision-making process and into the deÔ¨Ånition of sustainability policies directed at them. At this point it is worth noting that this discipline can also contribute through the application of participatory ergonomics. Included in the macroergonomic perspective, participatory ergonomics incorporates the concern for employees to be involved so that they become co-producers of solutions (Hendrick and Kleiner, 2001). In addition to enabling companies to achieve their desired goals based on the knowledge and power of workers (Wilson and Haines, 1997), they can be considered agents of improved working conditions (Zalk, 2001). Based on these premises, macroergonomics and participatory ergonomics, if applied at the strategic level, could contribute pro-actively to help the company achieve real goals of sustainability. It should be noted that the beneÔ¨Åts of involving ergonomics in corporate sustainability strategies may be recip- rocal (Zink and Fischer, 2013). On the side of ergonomics, it would be possible to overcome some limitations encountered by some authors, such as the continual need for management support and involvement (Driessen et al., 2010) and the need to convince or ‚Äúsell‚Äù ergonomic improvements through promises of injury reduction or cost-beneÔ¨Åt studies (Goggins et al., 2008).  5.  Conclusions  Enabling ergonomics to deal with work-related aspects in the context of sustainability can contribute to the later alignment of CS  
1236  I. Bolis et al.  / Applied Ergonomics 45 (2014) 1225e1239  and  to SD objectives. In a context characterized by concern for environment-related aspects, the dual goal of ergonomics (to adapt work to the psychophysiological characteristics of workers and to increase the organization‚Äôs performance) can help go beyond vi- sions that are almost exclusively economic in companies where the theme of sustainable development is applied inappropriately (exclusively to marketing). In this context, ergonomics would help to avoid issues that are not aligned with the vision of decent work and to propose sustainable work in CS programs. A case in point is the introduction of work-related aspects in sustainability policies with the sole purpose of shaping the conduct of workers or of maximizing the promotion of the corporate image (without engaging in truly responsible social and environmental actions). In other words, returning to Fig. 5, ergonomics can help place the action of CS squarely within the vision of sustainable development, at least from the standpoint of its internal social dimension. In the discussion of sustainability, ergonomics can contribute elements and shape transformations that go beyond the mitigative. In this context, sustainable work is believed to be that which im- proves the organization‚Äôs performance and promotes professional development as well as workers‚Äô health broadly and positively (not limited to the absence of illness, but in the sense of building health) and well-being. Thus, it fosters respect for and the development of intelligence and creativity (as opposed to alienating work) by per- forming work that has meaning and signiÔ¨Åcance, understanding the profound importance of physical, cognitive and organizational issues, and above all, the importance of work to the development of culture.

s0003687014000350,"  Thirty-Ô¨Åve percent of adults in the United States are currently obese and at increased risk of developing several metabolic, car- diovascular, and psychological disorders (Haskell et al., 2007; Mutrie, 2001). Health care costs attributed to obesity are approxi- mated to be $147 billion per year in the United States and those costs are predicted to increase to $200 billion per year over the next two decades (Finkelstein et al., 2009). Obesity results from a long- term excess of energy consumed vs. energy expended, a positive energy balance (Church et al., 2011). While overeating certainly contributes to a positive energy balance, the epidemic of obesity and related metabolic disorders is also driven by reductions in energy expended (Ford et al., 2012). With increased use of com- puters, ofÔ¨Åce workers may remain seated and sedentary (Barnes et al., 2012) during which energy expenditure is minimal, making many ofÔ¨Åces obesogenic environments (Mummery et al., 2005). Sedentary behavior not only contributes to positive energy balance but is also an independent risk factor for diabetes, cardiovascular  * Corresponding author.

Therefore, increasing physical activity and/or decreasing sedentary time are paramount to reducing obesity and associated disorders. However, traditional strategies to increase physical activity are compromised by insufÔ¨Åcient time for exercise, perception that exercise is boring, concern about appearance during exercise, and fatigue after the workday (Mayo Clinic, 2011). These barriers could be reduced by facilitating physical activity during working hours. Treadmill workstations have been promoted as means to in- crease physical activity during working hours. John et al. (2011) reported that ofÔ¨Åce workers, provided with a treadmill worksta- tion for nine months, increased their walking time by 38e  1, compared to baseline, and averaged a walking speed 75 min day of 1.5 mph. This duration and speed suggests an energy expenditure  1, above baseline (Levine and of approximately 100e200 kcal day Miller, 2007). Compared to baseline, the participants in this study exhibited signiÔ¨Åcant decreases in waist and hip circumference as well as improvements in blood lipids and cholesterol. Similarly, Koepp et al. (2013) recently reported that ofÔ¨Åce workers who were provided with a treadmill workstation for one year increased physical activity and decreased weight, while maintaining pro- ductivity (Koepp et al., 2013). This Ô¨Ånding of unchanged produc- tivity is important because other authors have reported that use of a treadmill workstation may compromise computer use accuracy (Funk et al., 2012; John et al., 2009) and/or work productivity  
S.J. Elmer,  J.C. Martin / Applied Ergonomics 45 (2014) 1240e1246  1241  (Thompson and Levine, 2011). A potential limitation of treadmill workstation use is that individuals who are overweight and obese are at increased risk for knee osteoarthritis (Felson et al., 1988) and thus may have limited ability to walk. As a non-weight bearing activity, cycling could serve as an alternative modality for facilitating increased physical activity in desk-bound ofÔ¨Åce workers. Indeed, Straker et al. (2009) evaluated the effects of a cycling workstation (computer desk and an upright exercise cycle) on physiological responses and computer operation in ofÔ¨Åce workers. SpeciÔ¨Åcally, these authors reported that heart rate values increased by w25% when pedaling and typing compared to normal sitting and typing. Additionally, these authors reported that typing performance while cycling was slightly compromised but was better than typing performance during treadmill walking. To the best of our knowledge, no previous authors have reported the actual rate of energy expenditure that individuals might self-select for pedaling during an ofÔ¨Åce task such as typing. It is also important to note that the previous cycling workstation design used by Straker et al. (2009) consisted of an upright exercise cycle with a relatively small seat. This design may present some ergonomic challenges, especially when using it for extended durations, as several participants in that study (9 out of 30) reported some form of hip or gluteal discomfort related to the exercise cycle seat. Further, such bicycle seats are known to reduce penile oxygen pressure, reÔ¨Çecting perineal compression (Schwarzer et al., 2002) and prolonged sitting on such seats can lead to perineal numbness and erectile dysfunction (Dettori et al., 2004). Thus, a cycling workstation with a recumbent seat position that is more similar to a standard ofÔ¨Åce chair may facilitate prolonged activity without risks associated with upright cycling. Our primary purposes for conducting this investigation were to 1) determine the metabolic cost associated with self-selected pedaling intensity while performing a standardized typing task and 2) assess the inÔ¨Çuence of pedaling on typing performance (typing time and number of typing errors). These responses were compared to those associated with normal sitting while typing. We hypothesized that compared to sitting while typing, pedaling while typing would increase metabolic cost without compromising typing performance. Additionally, because the accuracy and reli- ability of commercial exercise cycles to quantify power are not documented, our secondary purposes were to 1) fabricate a power measurement system to determine the actual power associated with pedaling the exercise cycle across a range of resistance levels and pedaling rates before and after the experimental trials and 2) compare the actual power, as determined by the power measure- ment system, to the power displayed by the exercise cycle console. This study could serve as an important Ô¨Årst step to utilizing a cycling workstation to reduce sedentary time and increase physical activity in ofÔ¨Åce settings.  2. "
s0003687014000362,"  Lower back pain and/or discomfort is commonly reported by police ofÔ¨Åcers (Trotter et al., 2009). Two aspects of police work have previously been implicated as causes of lower back pain: driving for long periods of time (Gyi and Porter, 1998), and the carriage of equipment (i.e., ‚Äúappointments‚Äù) on a belt (Kumar and Narayan, 1999). As back pain is one of the leading causes of loss of produc- tive work time (Stewart et al., 2003) any factors which could be linked to back pain within an occupational setting warrant research attention. Police vehicles are highly specialised and modiÔ¨Åed for police use through the addition of instrumentation and other de- vices; however, the seat is often overlooked, being no different than that of a normal passenger vehicle, despite the additional demands that are placed on it. One possible source of discomfort may be the interaction between appointments carriage method and vehicle seat design.  * Corresponding author.

Police appointments include the Ô¨Årearm, spare magazine, handcuffs, capsicum spray, and portable radio, amongst others. In New South Wales (NSW), Australia, ofÔ¨Å- cers could choose to wear their appointments on a belt or a com- bination belt with load bearing vest (LBV), at the time this study was conducted. The current study considers the ‚ÄòBelt‚Äô alone and LBV belt combination (henceforth referred to as ‚ÄòLBV‚Äô) carriage options. Both options can be seen in Fig. 1.  1.1. Measuring discomfort  ‚ÄòComfort‚Äô as a concept is difÔ¨Åcult to deÔ¨Åne. One way to consider comfort is as ‚Äúthe absence of discomfort‚Äù. Alternatively, ‚Äòcomfort‚Äô may be considered as being ‚Äúthe opposite to discomfort‚Äù (Kolich, 2008). A further difÔ¨Åculty is that the measurement of ‚Äòcomfort‚Äô is linked to aesthetic perception (Helander and Zhang, 1997), which may make it more difÔ¨Åcult for end users to rate it in an unbiased manner. In consideration of vehicle seats, ‚Äòdiscomfort‚Äô appears to be of greater relevance than ‚Äòcomfort‚Äô, as the presence of any discomfort implies a less than ideal situation. Comparison of sub- jective ‚Äòdiscomfort‚Äô is a common approach for investigating differ- ences between subjective opinion of seats (e.g., Ahmed and Babski- Reeves, 2009; Donnelly et al., 2009). The relationship between seat features and discomfort is a complex one, with subjective measures

Nonetheless, as comfort/discomfort is a personal experience, there is signiÔ¨Åcant value to using subjective measures as opposed to objective measures, such as muscle activation (Annett, 2002). As such, the subjective experience remains a key metric of vehicle seat discomfort assessment and the only way to measure an occupant‚Äôs personal experience. Although there is a wealth of information investigating seat comfort/discomfort, occupational studies have traditionally focused on ofÔ¨Åce workers. As seating comfort/discomfort is not uniform across environments, it is not possible to infer the out- comes of studies of non-vehicle based workplaces to vehicle based workplaces (Kyung et al., 2008). When considering a seat as a workplace any assessment of its comfort should take into consid- eration the requirements for the vehicle seat and the activities to be undertaken while occupying it (da Silva et al., 2012; Kolich, 2003). It has been suggested that a seat which is otherwise comfortable may be considered uncomfortable if it is not suitable for the activity demands of the occupant (da Silva et al., 2012). Subjective discomfort can be measured in a structured manner by questionnaire. One discomfort assessment tool which has been demonstrated to be highly valid and reliable is the Automotive Seating Discomfort Questionnaire (ASDQ) (Smith et al., 2006). The ASDQ was developed systematically and subsequently tested to ensure that results are not inÔ¨Çuenced by gender and are sensitive to changes of physical seat components (Smith et al., 2006). The questionnaire is designed speciÔ¨Åcally to identify individual seat features which contribute to discomfort and does not require subject matter expertise to complete. Questions investigate four seat features: upholstery, cushion, back rest and lumbar support, and the sub-components of each feature. The ASDQ is designed to be administered while a vehicle is stationary, thereby allowing participants to identify any physical seat components contributing to their discomfort and to avoid any effect of vibration (Smith et al., 2006). Vehicle seats pose a speciÔ¨Åc area of interest for seated comfort/ discomfort; in addition to being functional, vehicle seats must also be designed for comfort. Therefore, it may be expected that even when driving is an occupational requirement (as it is for a taxi driver, for example) the majority of occupants would experience ‚Äòno‚Äô or only ‚Äòslight‚Äô discomfort (Daruis et al., 2008); although, repeated exposure to a mild but recognisable level of discomfort may contribute towards occupant musculoskeletal pain in the long term (Donnelly et al., 2009).  Occurrence of ‚Äòextreme discomfort‚Äô is unlikely with modern vehicle seats. Therefore, identifying seats or seat features ascribed a clinically signiÔ¨Åcant degree of discomfort is just as, and perhaps even more, important than identifying statistically signiÔ¨Åcant inter- seat differences (Donnelly et al., 2009). In this context, clinical signiÔ¨Åcance is deÔ¨Åned as the minimum discomfort rating corre- sponding to a clinically meaningful level of subjective discomfort. Donnelly et al. (2009) specify an ASDQ discomfort score of 30 mm or more (on a visual analogue scale, ranging from ‚Äú0 mm‚Äù, no discomfort, to ‚Äú100 mm‚Äù, extreme discomfort) as being clinically signiÔ¨Åcant. Donnelly et al. (2009) do not provide justiÔ¨Åcation as to why a minimum score of 30 mm was deÔ¨Åned as clinically signiÔ¨Å- cant. However, an investigation to determine what constitutes a clinically signiÔ¨Åcant change in subjective pain, reports that a dif- ference of at least 9 mm is necessary for clinical signiÔ¨Åcance (Kelly, 1998). Additionally, the same study reports that a 20 mm change corresponds with a relatively large clinical effect, with no inÔ¨Çuence of age or gender (Kelly, 1998). By extension, it is reasonable to conclude that a discomfort level of at least 30 mm (or 3/10) is sufÔ¨Åciently large to signify clinical relevance.  1.2.  Police ofÔ¨Åcer in-vehicle discomfort  The ASDQ has been used previously with a police ofÔ¨Åcer pop- ulation. In a Canadian study, police ofÔ¨Åcers completed the ASDQ at the beginning and end of each shift (Donnelly et al., 2009). Police ofÔ¨Åcers reported experiencing discomfort due to the lumbar sup- port, the seat width, seat Ô¨Årmness and seat cushion contour. The lower back was rated as an area of signiÔ¨Åcant discomfort, in line with results of previous police ofÔ¨Åcer research (e.g., Gyi and Porter, 1998). Following on from their survey, Donnelly et al. (2009) demonstrated that greater control over the adjustability of the seat lumbar area in combination with an in-built lower back mas- sage system allowed the seat to be set up to minimize pressure on the appointments and, consequently, to reduce discomfort. How- ever, installing in-built massage systems on police vehicle seats would be costly as well as potentially distracting to drivers. Donnelly et al. (2009) assessed ofÔ¨Åcer discomfort while ofÔ¨Åcers used a belt to carry appointments. Appointments belts have been found to render seat back rests largely unusable and, consequently, to offer little or no support for those ofÔ¨Åcers who wear belts (Kumar and Narayan, 1999). It is possible that alternative appointments carriage methods, such as a LBV, may reduce discomfort; however, no investigations of ofÔ¨Åcer discomfort while wearing a LBV were identiÔ¨Åed in our literature search.  
A.J. Filtness et al.  / Applied Ergonomics 45 (2014) 1247e1256  1249  It is apparent from published research that police ofÔ¨Åcers experience musculoskeletal discomfort while working and that vehicle travel and appointments carriage on the belt may be contributing factors. Thus, the interaction between appointments carriage method and police vehicle seat features has the potential to moderate this discomfort. Structured consultation was under- taken with police ofÔ¨Åcers who are regularly exposed to driving while carrying appointments to assess discomfort speciÔ¨Åcally experienced due to vehicle seat features. Both ‚ÄúGeneral Duties‚Äù and ‚ÄúHighway Patrol‚Äù police ofÔ¨Åcers spend a large proportion of their work shift seated in vehicles while wearing appointments (Trotter et al., 2009). Thus, participants in this study were drawn from both duty types. Nonetheless, their responses were considered sepa- rately in order not to blur any potential differences in reported discomfort between duty types. Discomfort experiences were recorded while ofÔ¨Åcers wore appointments on: (1) a traditional appointments belt, and (2) a combination of a LBV and appoint- ments belt, and while seated in: (1) ‚ÄòStandard‚Äô and (2) ‚ÄòCustom‚Äô vehicle seats.  2. Method  2.1. Design  A 2  2 repeated measures study design was utilised with two types of appointments carriage method (‚ÄòBelt‚Äô and ‚ÄòLBV‚Äô) and two types of vehicle seats (‚ÄòStandard‚Äô and ‚ÄòCustom‚Äô). Order of exposure was counterbalanced. The research was approved by the Monash University Human Research Ethics Committee.  2.2.  Participants  Participants were 25 sworn police ofÔ¨Åcers (four female) recruited from the NSW Police Force. All participants used a police vehicle as part of their usual work duties and worked in a metro- politan area. The majority of participants (92%) ranked either Constable or Senior Constable. Two ofÔ¨Åcer duty types were repre- sented: 14 General Duties ofÔ¨Åcers (GDs) and 11 Highway Patrol (HwP) ofÔ¨Åcers. Two ofÔ¨Åcers in each group were female. In addition, two ofÔ¨Åcers in each group were left-handed (all males). All other participants were right-handed.  2.3.  Equipment  2.3.1. Appointments carriage  Two appointments carriage options were examined: ‚ÄòBelt‚Äô and ‚ÄòLBV‚Äô. When on duty, ofÔ¨Åcers are permitted to arrange their ap- pointments to their personal preference, although within certain constraints: prescribed placement of the Ô¨Årearm worn in the hip holster of the belt over the dominant hip and the spare magazine over the other hip, and limits on what can be included in the LBV pockets given their form and size. In accordance with NSW Police Force operating requirements, the Ô¨Årearm and spare magazine are not carried on the LBV but on the belt. Therefore, in line with the applied nature of the study protocol and in order to reÔ¨Çect real work conditions, participants were asked to bring their own ap- pointments and to set the position of each appointment to their preference on each carriage method. All the belts and LBVs were those authorized for use in the NSW Police Force. An example set up is show in Fig. 1. More recently, ofÔ¨Åcers may also choose a combination belt, LBV and thigh holster, in this case the Ô¨Årearm may be carried either in a hip holster off the belt or in a thigh holster, however, this combination is not investigated in the current work.  2.3.2. Vehicle seats  Three vehicle seats were used e a ‚ÄòCustom‚Äô-designed police vehicle seat (same for both duty types) and two police ‚ÄòStandard‚Äô seats. The ‚ÄòCustom‚Äô vehicle seat (Fig. 2a) was developed speciÔ¨Åcally to be used in police vehicles. Its main characteristics include;   Lower cushion bolster for easy entry;  Cut-away bolster to assist comfort with laden appointments belt;  Re-deÔ¨Åned lumbar region to pointments belt; and  Robust material selection in high wear areas.  comfort with laden ap-  assist  The seat was developed by Futuris, designers and manufacturers of automotive interiors, in collaboration with the National Safety Agency in Australia. Throughout the study the ‚ÄòCustom‚Äô seat was experienced in a Holden Commodore Omega, which is a popular, 4- door passenger sedan in Australia. The ‚ÄòStandard‚Äô seat was the stock seat of a vehicle model commonly used as a police vehicle by the NSW Police Force. In line with the applied nature of the investigation, the standard vehicle seats were selected to be ones which participants would regularly use in their normal work duties and were presented in the appropriate police vehicles. As participants represented two police duty types, two different ‚ÄòStandard‚Äô seats were used. GD partici- pants experienced the Hyundai iLoad seat (Fig. 2b). HwP partici- pants experienced the Ford Falcon XR6 seat (Fig. 2c). The Ford Falcon XR6 ‚Äúsport‚Äù style vehicle is most appropriate for the work under taken by HwP ofÔ¨Åcers as it has enhanced acceleration and cornering capabilities. Vehicles used for highway patrol are those most suited to pursuit and urgent duty. The Ford Falcon XR6 has a ‚Äúsporty‚Äù seat with prominent seat cushion and seat back bolsters. The Hyundai iLoad seat has a ‚Äúvan‚Äù seat with subtle seat cushion and seat back bolsters and, unlike the other two seats used, the iLoad offers no lumbar support adjustability. In essence, vehicles used for highway patrol are most suited to pursuits and urgent duty, while the vehicles used for general duties are the least suited to pursuits and urgent duty. Thus, the seats in the highway patrol vehicles tend to be more ‚ÄúÔ¨Ågure-hugging‚Äù and restrictive than those in the general duties vehicles. This comes about largely because of the more prominent bolsters. Approximate, non- technical measurements of certain vehicle seat components are given in Table 1.  2.4.  Structured questionnaires  2.4.1. Automotive Seating Discomfort Questionnaire (ASDQ)  The ASDQ is a comprehensive questionnaire designed to assess the effect of four seat features on musculoskeletal discomfort: upholstery, seat cushion, back rest and lumbar support (Smith et al., 2006). Participants rated the discomfort they experienced from each vehicle seat feature by its individual components using an adapted version of the ASDQ. Adaptation of the ASDQ was neces- sary because the original ASDQ is completed as a visual analogue scale. In the current study protocol it was desirable that partici- pants remain in an emulated driving position whilst completing the questionnaire, in order that movement unrelated to driving (such as that required to complete a paper-based questionnaire) would not inÔ¨Çuence results. Consequently, use of a categorical, Ô¨Åxed-point scale was necessary to facilitate verbal response. Additional ques- tions were included that pertained to the head restraint and seat- belt. In all cases, participants rated discomfort on an 11 point scale (0 ¬º ‚Äòno discomfort at all‚Äô to 10 ¬º ‚Äòextremely strong discomfort‚Äô).

Overall discomfort rating  While seated in each vehicle seat using each appointments carriage method, participants were asked to rate their overall discomfort level on an 11 point scale (0 ¬º ‚Äòno discomfort at all‚Äô to 10 ¬º ‚Äòextremely strong discomfort‚Äô). This single question scale provides participants overall opinion of their discomfort related to each experimental condition; and is the Ô¨Ånal question of the ADSQ.  2.4.3.  Body region discomfort questionnaire  An adapted version of the Discomfort Rating Scale (DRS) used by Kyung et al. (2008) was completed following the ADSQ questions for each particular seat feature. Discomfort level was recorded for left thigh, right thigh, using an 11 point scale (0 ¬º ‚Äòno discomfort at seven body areas: neck, upper back, lower back, left hip, right hip, all‚Äô to 10 ¬º ‚Äòextremely strong discomfort‚Äô).  2.5.  Procedure  Participants completed one test session lasting approximately 90 min. On arrival participants gave informed consent and completed a background questionnaire. Wearing the Ô¨Årst appointments carriage option participants entered vehicle one and adjusted the seat as they would do if they were working in that vehicle. For 5 min participants were seated in the vehicle seat with their seat belt fastened in a position emulating driving. At 1 min intervals participants completed Ô¨Åve reaching tasks characteristic of police work: turn on/off the warning lights and sirens, operate the radio, use the mobile data terminal, retrieve/return an item from the passenger foot well, and retrieve/ return an item from the rear passenger compartment.  After 5 min, the adapted ADSQ and the body region discomfort questionnaire were completed. In all cases the questions were read aloud by an experimenter and participants responded verbally. This procedure allowed participants to remain in the emulated driving position. Consequently, as noted above, visual analogue scales were not used. The procedure was repeated in the second vehicle. When the questionnaires had been completed in both vehicles the participant reset their appointments on the second carriage option and the in-vehicle procedure was repeated.  2.6. Data analysis  Results from the ASDQ and body region questionnaire are presented as means and standard deviations of discomfort rat- ings (out of 10). A repeated measures ANOVA compared ap- pointments ‚ÄòCarriage‚Äô method (2 levels: Belt vs. LBV) and vehicle ‚ÄòSeat‚Äô type (2 levels: Custom vs. Standard). Due to the different vehicle seats used, analyses were completed separately for each duty type. An alpha level of .05 was used to determine statistical signiÔ¨Åcance. As expected (see Section 1.1), discomfort ratings were generally low. To supplement statistically signiÔ¨Åcant results, clinical signiÔ¨Å- cance was considered. Overall discomfort ratings equal to or greater than three were considered clinically signiÔ¨Åcant in-line with Donnelly et al. (2009) and in relation to the Ô¨Åndings of Kelly (1998). In our adapted scale, an average rating of three is equivalent to an average rating of 30 on the traditional scale. To establish which seat features contributed to overall discomfort ratings, it was also desirable to consider adapted ASDQ ratings equal to or greater than  Table 1 Non-technical vehicle seat description and approximate dimensions (Note. All measurements were taken using a standard measuring tape).

three as clinically signiÔ¨Åcant. However, the results of discomfort from individual seat features are all less than three. In order that practical differences between adapted ASDQ items would still be identiÔ¨Åed, ratings of two were considered as contributing towards discomfort. This allows for practical distinction between the seat features, while still representing a large enough difference (from zero) to detect a large clinical effect (Kelly, 1998). Clinically signif- icant results are highlighted on Ô¨Ågures where appropriate. In cases of clinical discomfort resulting from seat features, body region discomfort results were examined.  3. Results  3.1.  Participant characteristics  On average, HwP participants had been police ofÔ¨Åcers for signiÔ¨Åcantly longer (12.6 y compared with 5.9 y) and worked signiÔ¨Åcantly shorter shifts (9.6 h compared with 11.7 h) than GD participants. Despite the shorter shift length, the average number of vehicle hours per shift did not differ signiÔ¨Åcantly between the two duty types. Additionally, HwP ofÔ¨Åcers had signiÔ¨Åcantly larger average waist circumferences (103.2 cm compared with 91.8 cm). Full participant characteristics are given in Table 2. cantly by duty type and carriage method. A 2  2 ANOVA revealed a The number of appointments carried by ofÔ¨Åcers varied signiÔ¨Å- signiÔ¨Åcant main effect of duty type. GDs (‚ÄòBelt‚Äô ¬º 13.0, ‚ÄòLBV‚Äô ¬º 12.3) wore signiÔ¨Åcantly more appointments than HwP ofÔ¨Åcers (‚ÄòBelt‚Äô ¬º 8.0, ‚ÄòLBV‚Äô ¬º 11.4) (F(1,21) ¬º 15.17, p ¬º .001).  3.2. Overall discomfort  Overall discomfort ratings are presented in Fig. 3. Three sce- narios resulted in clinically signiÔ¨Åcant discomfort (average rating  three): GDs in the ‚ÄòStandard‚Äô seat using the ‚ÄòBelt‚Äô and HwPs in the ‚ÄòStandard‚Äô seat using both the ‚ÄòBelt‚Äô and the ‚ÄòLBV‚Äô. Participants reported experiencing signiÔ¨Åcantly more discomfort when seated in the ‚ÄòStandard‚Äô vehicle seat compared with the ‚ÄòCustom‚Äô seat. This (F(1,13) ¬º 28.24, was true both for GDs p < .001) and HwP (F(1,10) ¬º .74, p ¬º .008). There was a signiÔ¨Åcant main effect of ap- pointments carriage method with the ‚ÄòBelt‚Äô resulting in greater overall discomfort than the ‚ÄòLBV‚Äô. This was true for both GDs (F(1,13) ¬º 5.64, p ¬º .034) and HwP (F(1,10) ¬º 12.20, p ¬º .006).

General duties  The results of the seat feature components of the adapted ASDQ for GD participants are presented in Fig. 4. Participants reported signiÔ¨Åcantly greater objection to the feel of the ‚ÄòStandard‚Äô seat upholstery compared to the ‚ÄòCustom‚Äô seat (F(1,13) ¬º 6.5, p ¬º .024). Discomfort produced by the backrest bolsters was signiÔ¨Åcantly greater in the ‚ÄòStandard‚Äô seat than the ‚ÄòCustom‚Äô seat (F(1,13) ¬º 5.23, p ¬º .004). The greatest discomfort reported by GD participants was from the backrest bolsters in the ‚ÄòStandard‚Äô vehicle while wearing the ‚ÄòBelt‚Äô. Regardless of seat type, levels of discomfort associated with the lumbar support were greater when ofÔ¨Åcers wore the ‚ÄòBelt‚Äô compared with the ‚ÄòLBV‚Äô. In particular, discomfort due to the pro- vision of support of the lumbar area (F(1,13) ¬º 6.76, p ¬º .022) and (F(1,13) ¬º 5.89, discomfort from the lumbar support pressure p ¬º .019) were signiÔ¨Åcantly greater. Although these two compo- nents of the lumbar area were both associated with signiÔ¨Åcantly higher discomfort when wearing the ‚ÄòBelt‚Äô compared to ‚ÄòLBV‚Äô, only the discomfort from the lumbar support reached a clinically sig- niÔ¨Åcant (average rating  two) level.  3.3.2. Highway patrol  The results of the adapted ASDQ among HwP ofÔ¨Åcers are pre- sented in Fig. 5. Discomfort ratings related to the seat cushion width and seat cushion bolsters differed between seat types. Discomfort caused by the seat cushion width was signiÔ¨Åcantly greater when participants were seated in the ‚ÄòStandard‚Äô seat (F(1,10) ¬º 8.42, p ¬º .016) as was discomfort due to the seat cushion bolsters (F(1,10) ¬º 20.60, p ¬º .001). The seat cushion bolsters in the ‚ÄòStandard‚Äô seat resulted in clinically signiÔ¨Åcant (average rating  two) ratings of discomfort when ofÔ¨Åcers were wearing both the ‚ÄòBelt‚Äô and ‚ÄòLBV‚Äô. Regardless of seat type, greater discomfort from the backrest bolsters was experienced when participants were wearing the ‚ÄòBelt‚Äô (F(1,10) ¬º 5.71, p ¬º .038). The greatest compared to the ‚ÄòLBV‚Äô discomfort experienced by the HwP participants related to the backrest bolsters of the ‚ÄòStandard‚Äô seat when wearing the ‚ÄòBelt‚Äô.  3.4.  Body region discomfort for speciÔ¨Åc seat features  Body region discomfort results are presented in relation to the backrest and lumbar support seat features for GD, and to the backrest and seat cushion for HwP. These seat features were those that resulted in clinically signiÔ¨Åcant (average rating  two) levels of discomfort on the adapted ASDQ.  Fig. 6 shows the results from the body region discomfort ques- tionnaire for the backrest and lumbar support features. Discomfort experienced in the lower back reached a clinically signiÔ¨Åcant (average rating  two) level while ofÔ¨Åcers were wearing the ‚ÄòBelt‚Äô in the ‚ÄòStandard‚Äô vehicle for both seat features. SigniÔ¨Åcantly greater discomfort was experienced from the backrest when ofÔ¨Åcers were seated in the ‚ÄòStandard‚Äô compared lower back (F(1,13) ¬º 5.18, with ‚ÄòCustom‚Äô vehicle seat, for the p ¬º .040), left hip (F(1,13) ¬º 15.80, p ¬º .002) and right hip (F(1,13) ¬º 7.22, p ¬º .019) regions. There was also a signiÔ¨Åcant ‚ÄòSeat‚Äô by ‚ÄòAppointments Carriage‚Äô interaction for discomfort caused to (F(1,13) ¬º 14.62, p ¬º .002) and right (F(1,13) ¬º 7.22, both the left p ¬º .037) hip from the backrest. The discomfort experienced from the lumbar support in the left hip was signiÔ¨Åcantly greater when (F(1,13) ¬º 4.79, p ¬º .047).

Discussion  Prolonged vehicle travel and appointments carriage on the belt have previously been identiÔ¨Åed as potential sources of pain and discomfort for police ofÔ¨Åcers (Donnelly et al., 2009; Gyi and Porter, 1998; Trotter et al., 2009). The current study was designed to

Twenty-Ô¨Åve sworn ofÔ¨Åcers from the NSW Police Force completed adapted versions of the ASDQ and body region discomfort questionnaire. OfÔ¨Åcers reported a signiÔ¨Åcantly greater amount of discomfort when seated in the ‚ÄòStandard‚Äô compared with the ‚ÄòCustom‚Äô vehicle seat, and while carrying appointments on the ‚ÄòBelt‚Äô compared to the ‚ÄòLBV‚Äô. The vehicle seat components which contributed most to the discomfort were the backrest bolsters, lumbar support, cushion bolsters and cushion width. The lower back and hips were the body areas most affected by discomfort.  Overall discomfort ratings conÔ¨Årm that ofÔ¨Åcers experience discomfort in their traditional work environment (i.e., a ‚ÄòStandard‚Äô vehicle seat and wearing appointments on a ‚ÄòBelt‚Äô); and that this discomfort can be alleviated by adjustments in vehicle seat design and appointments carriage method. Knowing that ofÔ¨Åcers experi- ence overall discomfort when they are seated in vehicles goes some way to explain the high prevalence of back pain reported by ofÔ¨Åcers who drive regularly (Burton et al., 1996; Gyi and Porter, 1998). It is important to note that the average overall discomfort in all cases was higher than that rated with respect to any individual seat component on the adapted ADSQ. Therefore, it is likely that a  Fig. 7.

Filtness et al.  / Applied Ergonomics 45 (2014) 1247e1256  1255  combination of slight discomfort among a variety of different seat components weighs up to an overall discomfort rating that is higher than one for any individual cause. Backrest bolsters are the vehicle seat component associated with the greatest discomfort, particularly when wearing the ‚ÄòBelt‚Äô in a ‚ÄòStandard‚Äô seat. The backrest bolsters in the ‚ÄòStandard‚Äô GD seat were less prominent than those in the HwP ‚ÄòStandard‚Äô seat. Nevertheless, the more subtle GD bolsters were still capable of causing discomfort for some GD ofÔ¨Åcers. Backrest bolsters have previously been implicated as causing discomfort in a civilian population (Udo et al., 1997). Therefore, it is not surprising that the backrest bolsters are also a source of discomfort for ofÔ¨Åcers, who have the added requirement of carrying appointments. The main difference between the backrest bolsters of the ‚ÄòCustom‚Äô and ‚ÄòStandard‚Äô seats was the length, with bolsters not extending to the base of the ‚ÄòCustom‚Äô seat. Subsequently, the backrest bolster of the ‚ÄòCustom‚Äô seat was associated with signiÔ¨Åcantly less discomfort for GD ofÔ¨Åcers than their ‚ÄòStandard‚Äô seat. However, shorter backrest bolsters may not be the solution to all backrest bolster-caused discomfort as HwP ofÔ¨Åcers still experienced discomfort in the ‚ÄòCustom‚Äô seat. Regardless, reduction of backrest bolster discomfort can still be achieved as HwP discomfort was reduced by wearing appointments on the ‚ÄòLBV‚Äô rather than on the ‚ÄòBelt‚Äô. It is likely that the most effective way to achieve a reduction to ofÔ¨Åcer discomfort is through a multi-method approach. The bolsters of the seat cushion were also a signiÔ¨Åcant source of discomfort: the ‚ÄòCustom‚Äô seat was associated with reduced discomfort for the HwP ofÔ¨Åcers. The ‚ÄòCustom‚Äô seat has a wider seat cushion than either the ‚ÄòStandard‚Äô seat, and the seat cushion bol- sters do not extend rearward as far as is typical. Results for HwP ofÔ¨Åcers suggest that seat width is a potential problem; however, this was not corroborated by results for GD ofÔ¨Åcers. Two likely contributing factors to this discrepancy are, Ô¨Årstly, that the seat cushion bolsters of the GD ‚ÄòStandard‚Äô seat are less prominent that the ‚ÄòStandard‚Äô HwP seat, and therefore may interact less with ap- pointments. Secondly, the HwP ofÔ¨Åcers had a signiÔ¨Åcantly larger average waist size than GD ofÔ¨Åcers. The failure of seat cushion bolsters to accommodate larger occupants has been recognised as a problem in a civilian population (Reed et al., 1994). Therefore, the larger HwP ofÔ¨Åcers may be more likely to experience discomfort due to seat cushion bolsters than the GD ofÔ¨Åcers. The third seat component identiÔ¨Åed as causing discomfort was the lumbar support region (GD ofÔ¨Åcers only). This discomfort for GD ofÔ¨Åcers could be reduced by moving appointments from a ‚ÄòBelt‚Äô to a ‚ÄòLBV‚Äô. One potential factor inÔ¨Çuencing this difference between GD and HwP ofÔ¨Åcers may be lumbar support adjustability, which has previously been identiÔ¨Åed as a problem for ‚ÄòBelt‚Äô wearing police ofÔ¨Åcers (Kumar and Narayan, 1999). The HwP ‚ÄòStandard‚Äô seat had an adjustable lumbar support and the GD ‚ÄòStandard‚Äô seat did not. A further, potential inÔ¨Çuencing factor is that the GD ofÔ¨Åcers carried more appointments, on average, than HwP ofÔ¨Åcers, particularly when wearing a belt. This additional load around the waist may have interacted with the vehicle seat lumbar region to increase discomfort. The variation of results suggests that further research into the lumbar region of vehicle seats could be beneÔ¨Åcial. Finally, the upholstery was reported as a source of discomfort for GD ofÔ¨Åcers. In this case, the GD ofÔ¨Åcers preferred the upholstery of the ‚ÄòCustom‚Äô seat which was leather look, compared to the ‚ÄòStan- dard‚Äô seat which had woven fabric. The difference in preference ratings was statistically signiÔ¨Åcant, however, the difference was very small, suggesting that, although ofÔ¨Åcers have a preference, upholstery is not of major importance for discomfort. This contrasts to the opinions of vehicle seating experts, whereby pressure from upholstery onto appointments and breathability qualities of up- holstery have been reported as important (Molenbroek et al.,  2009). Consequently, further research into the contribution of up- holstery to occupant safety and discomfort may be warranted. Lower back pain is one of the leading causes of lost productive work time (Stewart et al., 2003). As such, it would be beneÔ¨Åcial for police forces around the world to minimise the discomfort expe- rienced within this body area. The current study considered body region discomfort in relation to discomfort-causing seat features: backrest (GD and HwP), lumbar support (GDs) and seat cushion width (HwP). In line with previous research, discomfort was most frequently reported in the lower back (Gyi and Porter, 1998; Kumar and Narayan, 1999; Trotter et al., 2009). It is concerning that the ‚Äútraditional‚Äù police vehicle and appointments carriage methods (‚ÄòStandard‚Äô seat and ‚ÄòBelt‚Äô) resulted in clinically signiÔ¨Åcant ratings of lower back discomfort associated with the backrest for both GDs and HWP. Results suggest that a potential solution is to provide custom-designed seats for police vehicles. The ‚ÄòCustom‚Äô seat in the current study reduced lower back discomfort due to both the backrest (GD and HwP) and to lumbar support (GD). The hip region was also sensitive to discomfort from vehicle seat features. For right-hand dominant ofÔ¨Åcers the Ô¨Årearm is located above the right hip and the spare magazine on the left hip. Greater hip discomfort from the backrest (GD and HwP), lumbar support (GD) and seat cushion (HwP) was experienced by ofÔ¨Åcers in their ‚ÄòStandard‚Äô seat compared to the ‚ÄòCustom‚Äô seat. It is likely that the shorter-than-usual backrest bolsters of the ‚ÄòCustom‚Äô seat allowed space to accommodate the Ô¨Årearm and magazine, thereby putting less pressure on the hips. Altering appointments carriage method also has potential for reducing hip discomfort as, for the HwP of- Ô¨Åcers, right hip discomfort was rated lower when carrying ap- pointments on the ‚ÄòLBV‚Äô compared with the ‚ÄòBelt‚Äô. It is important to draw attention to the large degree of individual differences in reported discomfort. The large standard deviations observed demonstrate that symptoms and sources of discomfort in one person may not be the same for another. This highlights the difÔ¨Åculty of a ‚Äúone size Ô¨Åts all‚Äù approach to reducing seating-related discomfort. In order for all ofÔ¨Åcers to be accommodated, with their appointments, and have sufÔ¨Åcient spare space to complete all work activities, a high degree of seat feature adjustability is needed. Allowing freedom of movement is particularly important for reducing discomfort, as shifting the pelvis allows drivers to make postural adjustments, which change the distribution of pressure. These subtle movements delay discomfort onset (Reed et al., 1994). The current study suggests that wide parameters of adjustability for the backrest, lumbar support and seat cushion bolsters, would result in the greatest potential beneÔ¨Åts. A potential limitation of the current study is that it was not possible to ‚Äòblind‚Äô ofÔ¨Åcers to which seat and appointments carriage option they were using. It is therefore possible that some bias due to aesthetics or prior expectation may have occurred. Also, each seat was presented in a different vehicle. It was important for participants to be exposed to each seat in their intended context of use (in a vehicle), and participants were instructed to consider only the seat when making discomfort ratings. However, it is possible that speciÔ¨Åc features of a vehicle or past driving experience of that type of vehicle may have inÔ¨Çuenced ofÔ¨Åcers‚Äô discomfort ratings (Cascioli et al., 2011; Donati and Patel, 1999; Groenesteijn et al., 2009). In line with the applied nature of the study participants used their own appointments and set up each carriage method to their own preference. Consequently, the number of appointments was not consistent across participants or conditions. Finally, par- ticipants were only exposed to the vehicle seats for 5 min. During this time the vehicle was stationary. The restricted time was necessary because of a short time window in which police ofÔ¨Åcers were able to participate. While a minimum 20 min seating time would have been preferable (Reed and Massie, 1996), the repeated-  
1256  A.J. Filtness et al.  / Applied Ergonomics 45 (2014) 1247e1256  measures design was considered important and therefore exposure was restricted to 5 min in order that each vehicle and appointments carriage method combination could be experienced. This protocol facilitated the repeated-measures design being completed in a timely fashion; however, longer exposure periods would have been more representative of vehicle-based police work. The results of the current research are important as they conÔ¨Årm that police ofÔ¨Åcers experience discomfort under traditional work conditions (‚ÄòBelt‚Äô and ‚ÄòStandard‚Äô vehicle seat). The backrest bolsters, seat cushion bolsters and lumbar support were highlighted as the vehicle seat components which are most likely to cause discomfort, with the lower back and hips being implicated the most. The simple change of carrying appointments on a ‚ÄòLBV‚Äô, rather than on a traditional appointments ‚ÄòBelt‚Äô, appears to alleviate some discom- fort. Furthermore, customising police vehicle seats, making them wider and reducing the length of backrest and seat cushion bolsters also reduced ofÔ¨Åcer discomfort. However, ‚ÄòLBVs‚Äô and ‚ÄòCustom‚Äô seats do not eliminate all discomfort. Further beneÔ¨Åts could likely be achieved by widening the range of adjustable vehicle seat features and in particular including adjustable back rest and seat cushion bolsters. Purchasers of police vehicles are encouraged to seek ve- hicles equipped with seats encompassing seat features with a high degree of adjustability, thus ensuring the best chance of meeting the broadest range of ofÔ¨Åcers‚Äô requirements. Practical application of these Ô¨Åndings should be factored within considerations for crashworthiness.

s0003687014000374,"  Exposure to mechanical vibrations at the workplace, such as hand-transmitted vibrations, can arise in numerous labors (e.g., in construction or manufacturing industries), for example when manually handling powered tools. These hand-transmitted vibra- tions are associated with a variety of signs and symptoms including vascular and neurological disorders (GrifÔ¨Ån and Bovenzi, 2002). More speciÔ¨Åcally, it has been shown in several reviews that hand- transmitted vibrations are associated with upper extremity  Abbreviations: HARM, hand-arm risk assessment method; ICC, correlation coefÔ¨Åcient. * Corresponding author.

Although evidence is slightly inconsistent as there are also studies reporting weak evidence for the association of hand-arm vibration and upper-extremity complaints (da Costa and Vieira, 2010; Schweigert, 2002; van Rijn et al., 2010), it is generally accepted that hand-arm vibrations are an occupational risk. As a result of these potential occupational hazards, in 2002, European directives were communicated providing workers‚Äô exposure limits for whole-body and hand-arm vibrations (2002/44/ EC). These directives, that are based on health and safety re- quirements, specify the maximum intensity of vibrations a worker can be exposed to, considering the duration of this speciÔ¨Åc vibra- tion. Assessment of hand-arm vibrations is therefore based on both the duration and the intensity of the exposure. This approach is  
1258  P. Coenen et al.  / Applied Ergonomics 45 (2014) 1257e1262  supported by several studies showing that vibration, in which the exposure is a multiplication of duration and intensity of the hand- arm vibration, is associated with upper extremity disorders (Bovenzi, 2012; GrifÔ¨Ån, 2004; Sauni et al., 2009). Therefore, dura- tion as well as intensity of vibration should be considered to quantify the potential risk of musculoskeletal disorders of hand- arm vibrations. Objectively measuring hand-arm vibrations at work is laborious and challenging as highly speciÔ¨Åc and expensive equipment is needed. Occupational safety and health practitioners in general lack knowledge on how to perform these measurements (OSHA, 2008). Therefore, instead of objectively measuring hand-arm vi- brations, assessments are often based on self-reports, guides, standardized technical reports and information provided by man- ufacturers. However, these sources can contain substantial errors. One reason might be that the actual exposure highly depends on the circumstances in which a task is executed, the tools that are used, the material that is processed and individual worker‚Äôs char- acteristics. Another reason might be that such vibration assess- ments are often expressed in crude, qualitative metrics. Although validity of workers‚Äô self-reports of vibration of handheld powered tools were shown to be good to excellent (Stock et al., 2005), these estimates often systematically overestimate the actual vibration (Akesson et al., 2001; Palmer et al., 2000). Moreover, despite it has been shown that exposure to vibration should be expressed as a multiplication of the duration and the intensity of the vibration, only duration is addressed in the abovementioned studies. There- fore, reliable and valid assessment methods measuring vibration exposure in an easily applicable way at the workplace are scarce. The hand-arm risk assessment method (HARM) was developed (Douwes and de Kraker, 2009, 2014). In this assessment method, which was developed for occupational safety and health practi- tioners, jobs are classiÔ¨Åed according to their risk of arm, neck and or shoulder symptoms. Among other factors, such as awkward pos- tures and duration and frequency of force exertions, HARM takes the exposure to hand-arm vibrations into account. The HARM assessment method as a whole was tested elaborately and its predictive validity has been proven for arm, neck and shoulder pain (Douwes et al., 2014; Douwes and de Kraker, 2014). However, the quality of the subjective assessment of hand-arm vibrations which is part of the HARM assessment is largely unknown. During this particular subjective assessment of hand-arm vibrations, observers classify the intensity of the vibration into one of four vibration categories (Table 1), based on the European directives on the minimum health and safety requirements regarding vibration (2002/44/EC). Therefore a simple alternative was developed that is potentially more applicable than complicated and expensive objective measurements and more accurate than self-reports or the often used data provided by the manufacturers. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the inter-observer reliability and the concurrent validity of this subjectively assessed hand-arm vibra- tions (as used in HARM). In this study we hypothesize that our  Table 1 HARM vibration categories and corresponding description.  Category  1.  2.  3.  4.

Furthermore, we hy- pothesize that subjectively assessed vibration intensity is more accurate and reliable than (the often used) information provided by manufacturers as it is supposed that the intensity depends largely on the task performed. Eventually, we suspect that the subjective assessment method proposed here provides a suitable and easily applicable method that can be used in ergonomic practice.  2. "
s0003687014000398,"  Across all U.S. industries, carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) resulted in the highest number of lost workdays (25 or more days per case) in 2011 and continues to be a major cause of disability and cost to society (BonÔ¨Åglioli et al., 2013). Carpal tunnel syndrome is the most commonly reported peripheral nerve entrapment neuropathy (Herbert et al., 2000). On the basis of a review of several epidemiologic studies, there is evidence for positive associations between exposure to work- place factors such as repetition, force, and posture and CTS (NIOSH, 1997). Poultry work is highly repetitive and involves forceful movements and awkward postures, and puts employees at risk for CTS (Armstrong et al., 2008; Burt et al., 2011; Cartwright et al., 2012; Lipscomb et al., 2008). Previous work has found that certain medical conditions such as obesity, diabetes mellitus, and thyroid disease have been associated with CTS (Becker et al., 2002; Karpitskaya et al., 2002). Other individual risk factors for CTS include sex and age (Atcheson et al., 1998).  * Corresponding author. Tel.: √æ1 5134587173. jwy1@cdc.gov (K. Musolin), ddq2@cdc.gov jtw2@cdc.gov (J.T.

Ramsey),  In 2011, approximately 224,000 U.S. poultry employees slaugh- tered approximately nine billion birds for human consumption (BLS, 2012; USDA, 2008). In the 1960s, 85% of broiler chickens were sold as whole carcass. At that time, only 13% were sold as cut-up parts. By 1990, only 18% were sold as whole carcass and 56% were now sold as cut-up parts (USDA, 1998). Additionally, poultry meat processing has dramatically increased within rural areas of the southern U.S. in recent decades (McPhee and Lipscomb, 2009; Owens et al., 2010). As part of a 2012 health hazard evaluation (HHE) requested by plant management, National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) investigators determined the prevalence of CTS among poultry processing employees. This workplace HHE was conducted by NIOSH investigators following the authorizing federal regulations found in 42 CFR 85. The HHE request was required by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)/Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) to obtain an evisceration line speed waiver approval as part of its Salmonella Initiative Program. The objective of our evaluation was to determine prevalence of CTS among poultry processing employees using an epidemiologic case deÔ¨Ånition while taking into account non-occupational factors and assess any association between CTS prevalence and exposure groups.

Population  In May 2012, we observed work processes and practices, coor- dinated data collection efforts, and held conÔ¨Ådential employee medical interviews. In August 2012, we did an ergonomic assess- ment of job tasks focusing on hand and wrist activity and we invited Ô¨Årst-shift Fresh Plant production employees and all Ô¨Årst- shift live hang contract employees to participate in our assess- ment. Participation was voluntary and we obtained written informed consent from participants. Among the 375 Fresh Plant Ô¨Årst-shift production employees and live hang contractors, 318 (85%) completed the questionnaire and 284 completed an NCS; one of these NCS was not interpretable. Nerve conduction studies were not conducted on all questionnaire participants because of logis- tical issues and employee availability.  2.2.  Poultry plant description  NIOSH investigators focused on the Fresh Plant sections of the poultry plant involving First Processing (live hanging contractors, slaughtering, eviscerating, and chilling) and Second Processing (post-chilling, deboning, and cut-up). First Processing operated two evisceration lines across two shifts. Each evisceration line operated at 90 birds per minute, which was below the maximum speed of 140 birds per minute allowed by the USDA/FSIS for a facility of this type. Second Processing included Ô¨Åve cone lines for manual cut-up and deboning, each running at 35 birds per minute, as well as automated and manual thigh deboning.  2.3.  Epidemiologic assessment of carpal tunnel syndrome  To be considered a CTS case in our evaluation, participants had to meet all of the following criteria:   Answered ‚Äúyes‚Äù on the questionnaire to having pain, burning, numbness, or tingling in the hands or wrists more than three times or lasting 7 days or longer in the past 12 months.  Marked or shaded the location of their symptoms in the median nerve distribution area on a modiÔ¨Åed Katz (Katz et al., 1990)  Had hand symptom diagram. abnormal median nerve conduction (median mono- neuropathy) (Burt et al., 2011) in the symptomatic hand(s) as determined by neurologist-interpreted NCS.  The case deÔ¨Ånition for CTS was based on published studies (American Association of Electrodiagnostic Medicine, 1992; Katz et al., 1990) including the NIOSH ergonomic musculoskeletal dis- orders (MSDs) consortium studies (Burt et al., 2011). A participant was considered to have evidence of CTS if at least one hand met the case deÔ¨Ånition.  2.4. Questionnaires  The questionnaire obtained information on employees‚Äô demographics (sex, age, race), work history and duties (work hours, length of employment, job rotation), and hand-intensive tasks outside of their job. We also collected medical history thought to be associated with CTS (thyroid problems, kidney failure, diabetes mellitus, pregnancy, obesity) and information on the presence, frequency, and duration of neuropathic symptoms (pain, burning,  numbness, or tingling in their hands or wrists) and other muscu- loskeletal symptoms. Participants who reported hand or wrist symptoms in the past 12 months also completed a hand symptom diagram (Katz et al., 1990). Participants indicated the location of their hand or wrist symptoms by marking areas on the diagrams. These diagrams were used to identify symptoms associated with a classic median nerve distribution. Two NIOSH medical ofÔ¨Åcers independently evaluated the hand diagrams for each hand; a third medical ofÔ¨Åcer resolved any evaluations that differed.  2.5. Nerve conduction studies  An electrodiagnostic technologist certiÔ¨Åed by the American Association of Electrodiagnostic Technologists performed all of the NCS according to established guidelines (American Association of Electrodiagnostic Medicine, 1992; American Association of Electrodiagnostic Medicine et al., 2002) and was blinded to par- ticipant‚Äôs job title, medical information, and questionnaire responses. The NCS consisted of orthodromic distal median and ulnar motor and sensory latencies, amplitudes, and distances on both hands using surface electrodes and standard techniques on an XLTEK NeuroMax 1002 (Oakvale, Ontario, Canada). We measured each NCS participant‚Äôs height and weight to calculate body mass index (BMI) according to the following formula:  BMI ¬º weight  √∞  √û  703= height in pounds  ¬Ω  √∞  in inches  √û ¬ä2  Two board-certiÔ¨Åed neurologists independently reviewed the NCS tracings and interpreted results as either normal or abnormal based on established criteria (Burt et al., 2011); they resolved discrepancies by discussion. They were blinded to participant‚Äôs job title, medical information, and questionnaire responses. Abnormal median nerve conduction was deÔ¨Åned as a slowed latency or a decreased amplitude in the median nerve and either (1) normal distal ulnar nerve latency and amplitude or (2) distal median nerve latency greater than ulnar nerve latency. Participants were provided with their NCS results, an interpretation of their mean- ing, and NIOSH contact information if they had questions or concerns.  3.  Ergonomic exposure assessment  Our job assessments focused on hand and wrist activity, clas- sifying jobs based on a combination of repetitive/forceful move- ments and extreme/awkward postures, and tool use. We identiÔ¨Åed jobs with more hand-intensive and tool-oriented tasks for further evaluation. We compared our measurements of hand activity and force to the action limit (AL) and threshold limit value (TLV√í) rec- ommended by the American Conference of Governmental Indus- trial Hygienists (ACGIH√í) (ACGIH, 2012). This TLV was validated in a large cohort study by BonÔ¨Åglioli et al. (2013), and predicted both CTS symptoms and CTS conÔ¨Årmed by NCS (BonÔ¨Åglioli et al., 2013). We used the following approach to evaluate selected jobs:   Hand activity level (HAL): Two NIOSH ergonomists used the HAL scale to rate repetitiveness for right and left hands during at least Ô¨Åve complete work cycles. They independently rated each  Force: Both NIOSH ergonomists independently also rated exer- job task. tion of the right and left hands using the modiÔ¨Åed Borg CR-10 scale (Borg, 1982).  We used the HAL and force ratings to calculate a ratio using the formula: Ratio ¬º Force/(10   HAL) following (Eastman Kodak,  Please cite this article in press as: Musolin, K., et al., Prevalence of carpal tunnel syndrome among employees at a poultry processing plant, Applied Ergonomics (2014), http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2014.03.005  
K. Musolin et al.  / Applied Ergonomics xxx (2014) 1e7  3  2004). If the ratios for the hands were different, we used the more protective (higher) ratio. We used the calculated ratio to determine an exposure value for each job task for comparison to the ACGIH reference values. We classiÔ¨Åed job tasks by exposure values into the following three groups:   Ratios below 0.56 were below the AL (exposure Group 1)  Ratios 0.56e0.78 were at or above the AL to the TLV (exposure  Ratios above 0.78 were above the TLV (exposure Group 3) Group 2)  4.  Statistical analysis  All statistical analyses were done using SAS Version 9.3 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). We reported descriptive statistics for demographic, occupational, and non-occupational variables. Fre- quencies and prevalences were reported for CTS cases for each exposure group. Some of the prevalences of the individual com- ponents that made up the CTS case deÔ¨Ånition were also calculated. We used log-binomial regression with the copy method (Deddens et al., 2003) to estimate adjusted CTS prevalence and to evaluate the relationship between CTS prevalence and the exposure groups after adjusting for age, sex, BMI, and diabetes mellitus. We reported prevalence ratios and 95% conÔ¨Ådence intervals. ConÔ¨Å- dence intervals that did not include the null value (1) indicated a statistically signiÔ¨Åcant relationship.  5. Results  5.1.  Epidemiologic assessment of carpal tunnel syndrome  Table 1 shows the demographics and personal characteristics of the participants. The average age of participants was 39 (range: 19e 73), and participants were predominantly African American (94%). Two hundred twenty-four (70%) were female and 18 reported being pregnant. Of 284 participants who had NCS, 143 (50%) had a BMI  30, which is considered ‚Äòobese‚Äô (CDC, 2014). We asked participants about medical conditions ever diagnosed by a physician. Of 318 participants, 32 (10%) reported that a physician diagnosed them with CTS, 27 (8%) hand or wrist tendonitis, 18 (6%) thyroid problems, 17 (5%) diabetes mellitus, 14 (4%) trigger Ô¨Ånger, 8 (3%) ganglion cyst, and 1 (0.3%) kidney failure.

The participants worked for an average of 38 h the week prior to our visit and had been at the plant for an average of 8 years. Of 150 (47%) employees who usually worked some overtime, the amount of overtime hours worked ranged from 0.3 to 18 h per week with an average of 7 h per week. The prevalence of hand or wrist symptoms in the last 12 months (a component of the CTS case deÔ¨Ånition) was 67%; 150 (71%) of 212 with these symptoms reported having these symptoms in the last 7 days. Of 137 with symptoms within 7 days of our visit, 98 (72%) met the case deÔ¨Ånition for carpal tunnel syndrome. Also, for this investigation, we had two independent neurologists interpret NCS results (a component of the CTS case deÔ¨Ånition), resulting in 204 of 283 (72%) with abnormal results, indicating the presence of median mononeuropathy. The number of participating employees meeting the case deÔ¨Å- nition for CTS was 126 of 301 (42%). Fig. 1 (DeÔ¨Åning a Case of Carpal  Tunnel Syndrome among Poultry Employees) illustrates how a case of  CTS was deÔ¨Åned among poultry employees. This denominator of 301 included all participants who had sufÔ¨Åcient questionnaire (symptom information including frequency, duration, and location) and/or NCS results to be classiÔ¨Åed according to the multipart case deÔ¨Ånition. Table 2 shows the prevalence of CTS cases among par- ticipants by exposure group. Unadjusted prevalence increased with increasing exposure, rising from 36% in the lowest exposure group to 48% in the highest exposure group. Table 2 also shows the results from our log-binomial regression model adjusting for sex, age, BMI, and diabetes mellitus, indepen- dent variables known to be associated with CTS. The adjusted prevalence of CTS in exposure Group 3 was statistically signiÔ¨Åcantly higher than that for exposure Group 1 [PR ¬º 1.61, 95% CI ¬º (1.20, 2.17)]. We examined the relationship between CTS and several vari- ables. Females were found to have signiÔ¨Åcantly higher prevalence of CTS than males [PR ¬º 1.67, 95% CI ¬º (1.16, 2.39)]. The participants who reported a physician diagnosis of diabetes mellitus were signiÔ¨Åcantly more likely than those without a physician diagnosis of diabetes mellitus to meet our CTS case deÔ¨Ånition [PR ¬º 1.54, 95% CI ¬º (1.02, 2.30)]. Obese participants were found to have signiÔ¨Å- cantly higher prevalence of CTS than non-obese participants [PR ¬º 1.74, 95% CI ¬º (1.32, 2.30)]. The participants with CTS were signiÔ¨Åcantly older than those without CTS (mean age 42 versus 38, P ¬º 0.02). Reporting a physician diagnosis of thyroid problems was not signiÔ¨Åcantly associated with our CTS case deÔ¨Ånition [PR ¬º 1.13, 95% CI ¬º (0.67, 1.91)]. No one who reported kidney failure met our CTS case deÔ¨Ånition. Reporting regularly doing hand-intensive tasks outside of the job (working at home, doing hobbies, playing sports, or working at a second job) was not found to be statistically signiÔ¨Åcantly related to our CTS case deÔ¨Ånition [PR ¬º 0.78, 95% CI ¬º (0.54, 1.13)].  5.2.  Ergonomic assessment  The two ergonomists individually assessed 67 job tasks in the plant. For these assessments, the ergonomists HAL and force ratings never differed more than one point. The 67 job tasks listed by department and exposure group are shown in Table 3. Although the ACGIH TLV for hand activity and force is intended for individual jobs, the TLV documentation states that it can be extended to multi- task jobs by using time-weighted exposures (ACGIH, 2012). The number of participating employees that reported rotating job tasks was 130 of 318 (41%). We calculated the time-weighted exposures using job task rotation information provided by each employee for an average day. Although some participants indicated that they worked overtime, we did not have access to overtime information  Please cite this article in press as: Musolin, K., et al., Prevalence of carpal tunnel syndrome among employees at a poultry processing plant, Applied Ergonomics (2014), http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2014.03.005

Participants were then grouped into exposure categories using the ACGIH reference values (the AL and TLV). Table 4 shows the dis- tribution of participants by exposure group.  6.

This variation in case deÔ¨Ånition may contribute to differences in the reported prevalence of CTS ranging from 7.8% to 73.9% (Cartwright et al., 2012; Kim et al., 2004). We found that 42% of participants met our CTS case deÔ¨Ånition. Although the CTS prevalence is higher in this evaluation than that reported in other poultry industry studies, a similarly high preva- lence of CTS has been reported in employees performing other highly repetitive and forceful manual operations (BonÔ¨Åglioli et al., 2006; Rosecrance and Douphrate, 2010). A CTS prevalence of 74% was found among meat and Ô¨Åsh-processing plant employees (Kim et al., 2004) and a CTS prevalence of 43% was found among as- sembly employees (BonÔ¨Åglioli et al., 2006) using case deÔ¨Ånitions similar to ours. Cartwright et al. (2012) reported on results of CTS among poultry processing employees and other manual labor oc- cupations (Cartwright et al., 2012). Cartwright categorized positive CTS results as ‚Äúpossible CTS‚Äù or ‚ÄúCTS.‚Äù Both those categories would be included in our CTS case deÔ¨Ånition as Cartwright‚Äôs categories were based on a scoring system using similar criteria. Because both early detection and aggressive treatment are key to averting problems and possibly disabling injuries (Dokuztug et al., 2006; Poultry Safety and Health Committee, 1986), we chose a more sensitive (inclusive) case deÔ¨Ånition for CTS than that chosen by Cartwright.

Approximately 41% of par- ticipants were performing job tasks that were above the ACGIH TLV for hand activity and force. We found a higher CTS prevalence among employees with greater exposure. A previous study (in Ô¨Åsh- processing workers) found a signiÔ¨Åcant relationship between increasing exposure to repetition and force and increasing preva- lence of CTS (Chiang et al., 1993). Regarding workplace changes, on the basis of the high preva- lence of CTS in the lowest exposure category (Group 1), job task rotation alone is unlikely to be sufÔ¨Åcient to control MSDs in this plant. We identiÔ¨Åed CTS cases in all three exposure categories, with a signiÔ¨Åcantly higher prevalence of CTS in the higher exposure group as compared to the lower exposure group. It is possible that some cases in the lower exposure groups (below the ACGIH AL and below the ACGIH TLV) were a result of employees having worked in  Please cite this article in press as: Musolin, K., et al., Prevalence of carpal tunnel syndrome among employees at a poultry processing plant, Applied Ergonomics (2014), http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2014.03.005

Moreover, a review of the rotation logs showed that, although 41% of participants reported rotating to different job tasks, the rotation was usually from one high exposure job task (Group 3) to another high exposure job task (Group 3) or from one lower exposure job task (Group 1) to another lower exposure job task (Group 1). Rotation among job tasks of similar exposure risk has not been found to reduce the risk of developing MSDs (Jonsson, 1988). Job rotation should reduce fatigue and stress of muscles and tendons by rotating employees to job tasks that use different muscle-tendon groups (OSHA, 1993). Rotating from higher exposure tasks to lower exposure tasks has been found to result in less fatigue and improved performance (Raina and Dickerson, 2009). Job rotation decisions should include evaluating jobs using the ACGIH TLV; when the AL is exceeded, other ergonomic controls should be employed. Since 1986, the Poultry Safety and Health Committee Task Force (Poultry Safety and Health Committee Task Force, 1986) has pub- licized the importance of early medical intervention for preventing serious MSDs and that early detection and aggressive treatment of MSDs is the key to averting problems and possibly disabling in- juries (Poultry Safety and Health Committee Task Force, 1986). Medical intervention, however, must be combined with job changes to reduce exposure to the known factors inherent in the current methods for processing poultry.  7.  Strengths and limitations  Our CTS case deÔ¨Ånition used well-accepted criteria (including objective nerve conduction measurements assessed by two inde- pendent board-certiÔ¨Åed neurologists). To assess hand activity and force we used the ACGIH TLV for HAL, a standardized and validated assessment tool. This evaluation was a cross-sectional survey that measured health outcomes and exposures at a single point in time; cross-sectional studies provide data useful for supporting in- ferences of cause and effect. Selection bias was reduced because of the 85% participation rate. Inherent in this type of study is the potential for ‚Äúsurvivor bias‚Äù (i.e., including people who may have remained in their jobs, and not capturing those who may have left work because of injury or other reasons). Such survivor bias may result in an underestimation of the prevalence of CTS. Some exposure misclassiÔ¨Åcation may have occurred because our expo- sure assessment was based on the current job(s) and did not ac- count for overtime work or shift work. Of 150 who usually worked some overtime, the average was 7 h per week. Also, some evidence shows that employees on later work shifts experience more injuries and, therefore, our evaluation of only the Ô¨Årst-shift may be an underestimation of the prevalence (Strong and Zimmerman, 2005).  8.  Conclusions  Forty-two percent of participating poultry processing em- ployees had evidence of CTS, and 41% of participants were working in jobs above the ACGIH TLV for hand activity and force. Also, increasing levels of hand activity and force were associated with increased CTS prevalence among participants. Despite repeated studies in this industry in the past 20 years Ô¨Ånding high prevalence of CTS, poultry processing jobs continue to be hazardous. OSHA has had guidance for preventing MSDs in the poultry industry since early 2000 (OSHA, 2013). Likewise, the National Chicken Council and the Poultry and Egg Institute have long standing workplace recommendations regarding ergonomics and injury prevention (National Chicken Council, 2008; The Poultry & Egg Institute, 2013). We found that many of these recommendations were not being  followed; that employees at this plant were exposed to hand ac- tivity and force levels above the recommended TLV, and those employees were not adequately followed up medically. We pro- vided several recommendations to the plant to reduce employee exposure to levels of hand activity and force, including: (1) designing job tasks so that they are below the ACGIH TLV; (2) automating or semi-automating front half deboning and thigh deboning tasks; (3) employing a job rotation schedule in which employees rotate between jobs that use different muscle groups and that are below the AL of the ACGIH TLV; and (4) instituting a medical surveillance program for MSDs to monitor employee health and determine the effectiveness of exposure prevention and medical management strategies. The challenge to the industry is to design poultry processing work to reduce risk factors for MSDs and to closely follow existing guidelines for prevention, early recogni- tion, and medical management of MSDs.

s0003687014000404,"  Designers and ergonomist practitioners often are asked to pro- duce designs that will concurrently accommodate users on multi- ple anthropometric dimensions, but have only percentile tables with which to develop those dimensions. For example, it might be necessary to estimate 95th percentile seated elbow height above the Ô¨Çoor as a combination of 95th percentile seat height and 95th percentile elbow height above the seat. In this paper, we demon- strate that using either the median or mean of the range of possible correlation values, as appropriate, to combine two or more anthropometric variables is both more accurate and more reliable than adding or subtracting percentile values. It might accurately be said that combining (adding or sub- tracting) percentiles is the least preferred option that you should choose when developing anthropometric models. Combining per- centiles, for example adding two 95th percentile values in the expectation that the result will produce 95 percent accommodation is likely to introduce substantial error into anthropometric models  * Corresponding author.

(Nah and Kreifeldt, 1996; Gordon, 2002; Robinette and McConville, 1981). Nah and Kreifeldt (1995) note that the error between the expected percent accommodation and the actual percent accom- modation can be substantial, for example achieving only 50 percent accommodation instead of the expected 95 percent when two 95th percentile values are subtracted. While multivariate models, such as Principle Component Anal- ysis, can accurately model combinations of anthropometric vari- ables, a designer or ergonomist is often presented with only a summary table of percentile data, consequently lacking the data necessary to use other strategies that will produce accurate models. Similarly, they may lack the tools or knowledge to utilize multi- variate techniques. Roebuck (1995) notes that not knowing the correlation between anthropometric variables is an underlying cause of this inaccuracy. When a designer adds equal percentile values of two anthropo- metric variables, he or she implicitly assumes that the correlation between them is 1.0, regardless of the actual value of the correla- tion coefÔ¨Åcient. To see why this is so, consider that a form of the regression equation is ZY ¬º rxYZx, where ZY and Zx are the z-scores corre- sponding to values of Y and X and rxY is the correlation between X and Y (Nolan and Heinzen, 2012).

When a third variable C is added to a previously combined pair of variables, the variance, VARAB √æ C, is  1.1.  The next to the last thing to do  This paper describes a method to minimize the error of esti- mates of the combined variance of two variables in comparison to adding or subtracting percentiles. It describes a method of dealing with the unknown, pair wise correlations between any group of anthropometric variables and the average, or expected error in the estimate of a combination of a group of combined variables. Although the individual variances or the standard deviations of anthropometric variables are commonly given (Roebuck, 1995; Gordon et al., 1989; Harrison and Robinette, 2002; Pheasant, 1988; Norris and Wilson, 1995), this is not always the case. For those cases, a method of estimating the variance is suggested in Section 7.0; although that method must be used with caution as non-normally distributed variables may lead to substantial error.  2. Combining two variables with known means, variances and correlation  Any two variables can be combined if the means, variances, standard deviations, and correlation between the two variables (rAB) are known (Roebuck, 1995; Pheasant, 1988). Knowledge of either the standard deviation or the variance implicitly determines the other, as the standard deviation is the square root of the variance. When two variables are added together, the combined mean, MAB, is equal to MA √æ MB, where MA is the mean of variable A and MB is the mean of variable B.

Appropriateness of Eqs. (7) and (8) if normally distributed  the variables are not  The Pearson productemoment correlation describes a linear relationship between two variables. If the variables are distributed as bivariate normal, then the Pearson correlation completely de- scribes the dependency relationship between them. Expressed alternatively, if for two bivariate normal variables the Pearson correlation is zero, then the two variables are independent. However, if the variables are not normally distributed, the cor- relation coefÔ¨Åcient still describes any linear dependency that exists between them. Interpretation of the signiÔ¨Åcance of the correlation is however, problematic.  2.2. Non-linear dependence  It is possible for two variables to be non-linearly dependent. A simple example is Y ¬º X2 for values of X between  100 and 100. Although Y is clearly dependent on X, the Pearson correlation be- tween the values of X and Y is zero. We do not consider here whether or not anthropometric elements have non-linear dependencies.  MAB ¬º MA √æ MB  (1)  3. Combining two elements without knowledge of the correlation (rAB) between them  While a combined mean can be calculated when rAB is unknown using Eqs. (1) and (2), calculating the combined variance using Eqs. (3) and (4) is not possible when the correlation is unknown. It is possible to estimate rAB in order to calculate the combined variance when adding or subtracting variables; however, this will introduce error into the calculated value of the combined variance. The error can be expressed as the difference between the variance as calculated with the true value of rAB and the variance as calcu- lated with the estimated correlation value, r0  AB.        Error in VARAB ¬º  √æ S2  B   2rAB SA SB  S2  A     √æ S2  B   2r  S2  A  0  AB SA SB    For any two variables, this can be simpliÔ¨Åed to  Error  in VARAB ¬º 2SA SB   rAB   r  0  AB    The error may be thought of as a function of tween rAB and r0 If a third variable is combined with the composite of A and B, then the error is  the distance be-  AB.     rAB   r  0  AB     √æ 2SAB SC  r√∞AB√ûC   r  0  √∞AB√ûC  (9)  (10)    When two variables are subtracted from one another, the combined mean, MAB, is equal to MA   MB, where MA is the mean of variable A and MB is the mean of variable B.

In the following sections, the median is shown to be the most appropriate estimator when combining any pair of anthropometric variables and the mean is shown to be preferred as the estimator when more than two variables are combined. Both provide more accurate combinations of anthropometric variables than does the combination of percentiles.  3.1.  The median as the estimator of possible correlation values  A property of the median of a set of data points is that the sum of the distances between the median and all the other data points is minimized (Hanley et al., 2001). Consequently, assuming that the correlation r0 AB is equal to the median of the possible range of correlation values will minimize the sum of all possible absolute errors, and, consequently, the average absolute error in the estimate of the correlation value.  3.2. The mean as the estimator of the range of possible correlation values  A property of the mean of a set of data points is that the sum of the deviations, or differences between the mean and all the other data points is 0. Unlike the absolute deviations about the median, the sum of deviations about the mean takes account of the direction (sign) of the difference between the true correlation and the mean.  3.3.  The median or the mean as the estimator  When only two anthropometric variables are combined, there is only one value for the difference between the true value and the estimator. The median is the appropriate estimator to use, as, on average, it minimizes the absolute difference between the estimator and the median. For a single difference between the true and esti- mated correlation values, in terms of average absolute difference, the median is as close or closer to the true value than the mean. When more than two anthropometric variables are combined, there are two or more difference values between the mean and the estimator. The mean is the appropriate estimator to use, as it in- corporates the algebraic sum of the multiple difference values. That is, a high and low value will tend to cancel one another, as the sum of the deviations about the mean is always 0. An example presented in Section 4.1 is based on a uniform distribution of possible correlation values ranging between  1 and 1. Since it is a symmetric distribution, the mean and median are equal to one another, and the average error in the estimate of the true correlation value is 0 for both the mean and the median. However, the actual distribution of the correlation values is not known.  3.4. An example where r is uniformly distributed between  1 and 1  If the possible correlation values are uniformly distributed between  1 and 1, then both the mean and the median are equal to zero. If the median or mean are used as estimators of the correla- tion values, r, then the total sum of possible differences between the true and assumed correlation values is given by  Z1  √∞0   r√ûdr  3.8.

4  T.J. Albin, P. Vink / Applied Ergonomics xxx (2014) 1e7  In Sections 3.2 and 3.3, the median was described as the opti- mum estimator when two variables are combined and mean as the optimum estimator when three or more variables are combined. When three or more variables are combined, the expected error in the estimate of the variance of the combined variables is addi- tive. That is, the average error in the estimate of the variance of the combination of A and B adds to the average error in the estimate of AB √æ C. However, the deviations about the mean always sum to 0, no matter what the range of correlation values or how the corre- lation values may be distributed.  3.9.  Relative accuracy of estimates from preliminary studies  Two previous studies (Albin, 2013a,b) have compared the rela- tive accuracy of combining pairs of anthropometric variables, contrasting adding or subtracting percentiles with pairs combined using Eq.

In the Ô¨Årst study, the true 95th percentile values for 20 pairs of combinations of 5 anthropometric elements (10 addition and 10 subtraction) were compared to estimates obtained by either combining percentiles or combining the variables assuming that the median possible correlation value was 0. Relative error was determined as the difference between the true value and the estimated value divided by the true value. For addition, the average relative error was  2.4 percent of the actual dimension for combining percentiles and 0.7 percent for the me- dian method. For subtraction, the average relative error was 26.7 percent for combining percentiles and  11.1 percent for the median method. In the second study, for addition of two anthropometric ele- ments, the average relative error when estimating the 95th percentile and 5th percentile was 4.3 percent and 5.9 percent respectively for combining percentiles and 1 and 1.3 percent respectively when the median was assumed equal to 0. For sub- traction of the two elements, the relative errors for the 95th and 5th percentile values when combining percentiles were 12.6 percent and 13.3 percent respectively; for the median method, the relative error values were 3.5 percent and 4.4 percent respectively.  4. A suggestion that the example case (uniform distribution of r between L1 and 1) is viable as an initial approach to estimating r  As described in Section 1 and elsewhere (Albin, 2013a,b), adding or subtracting percentiles implicitly assumes that the correlation between the combined variables is 1.0. Unless all the variables are perfectly correlated, then almost any other possible value of would be a better estimator of r than 1.0. The median and mean of the possible correlation values are attractive estimators of the actual value of r, as they minimize the error for combinations of any  r  Table 1 Mean error estimated combined variances for N variables when r0 AB ¬º 0.  r0  AB ¬º 1 and when  Variables  A √æ B AB √æ C ABC √æ D  ABC.(N   1) √æ ..N  Mean error when √∞r 0  AB  ¬º 1√û  Mean error when √∞r 0  AB  ¬º 0√û  2(SASB) 2(SASB) √æ 2(SABSC) 2(SASB) √æ 2(SABSC) √æ 2(SABCSD) 2(SASB) √æ 2(SABSC) √æ 2(SABCSD). √æ 2(SABC.N   1SN)  0 0 0 0  for  combinations of more than two variables,  two variables or respectively. In the absence of any knowledge of the range and distribution of correlation values, assuming the range to be between  1 and 1 and the values to be uniformly distributed is a conservative estimate. It is entirely possible that future research might determine that the range of values is more limited or that the distribution of values is not uniform. However, this would affect only the values of the median and mean, not their ability to minimize error as previously described. Similarly, the errors described in Table 1 would have different values, but estimates based on the median or the mean would still have less error than adding percentiles.  4.1. Uncertainty regarding known correlation values for combinations of three or more variables  On occasion some information regarding the correlation values of the variables may be known. For a single combination of two variables, prior knowledge of the possible correlation values is very useful, as the exact correlation value can be used to combine two variables, resulting in an accurate estimate of the combined variance. However, when more than two variables are combined, the act of combining the Ô¨Årst pair creates a different set of correlation values between the newly combined pair and the remaining vari- three variables: A ¬º (1,2,3,4,5), ables. As an example, consider B ¬º (2,3,1,5,4), C ¬º (2,6,4,10,8). Their correlation values are AB ¬º 0.60, AC ¬º 0.80, BC ¬º 0.90. If A and B are added, then the correlation with C is 0.95; how- ever, if B is subtracted from A, then the correlation with C is  0.11, if A is subtracted from B, the correlation with C is 0.11. All the new correlation values are outside the range of the original set of cor- relation values. If the mean or median of the Ô¨Årst set of correlation values is used to predict the correlations of the second set, the average deviation is  0.45. about their mean (0.77) In contrast, if the mean is assumed to be 0, then the average deviation about the mean is 0.32. Similarly, if the average absolue deviation is Ô¨Årst calculated using the median of the original correlation values (0.8), the average absolute deviation for the second set of correlation values is 0.58. If the median is assumed to be 0, then the average absolute deviation for the second set of correlation values is 0.39. Although this is not conclusive proof that the distribution of r should be treated as uniformly distributed between  1 and 1, it does suggest that such an assumption is at least tenable as a starting point pending more research on the actual distribution of r.  5. Questionable normality of the distribution of anthropometric data  If anthropometric data are normally distributed, then the percent accommodated may be calculated by using the equation  Percent accommodated ¬º MCombined √æ Z √∞Scombined √û  (17)  Z  where corresponds to the appropriate Z-value, for example  1.645 for the 95th and 5th percentiles. Mcombined is the mean of the combined anthropometric elements and Scombined is the standard deviation of the combined elements. However, it does not appear that anthropometric data may be reliably treated as normally distributed. Normally distributed data have a skew of zero and, for large samples, a standard error of skewness (SES), approximately equal to O(6/N). If the skew value divided by the SES is equal to or greater than 2, the distribution is  Please cite this article in press as: Albin, T.J., Vink, P., A method superior to adding percentiles when only limited anthropometric data such as percentile tables are available for design models, Applied Ergonomics (2014), http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2014.03.006

However, the accommodation intervals may be very wide relative to the more familiar Gaussian distribution based accommodation intervals.  5.2.  Simultaneous accommodation of N anthropometric elements  A pair wise concatenation of N elements results in an aggregate mean and variance for the combination of those N elements. Use of the Chebyshev inequality allows a statement of the percent of the aggregate scores accommodated within a range deÔ¨Åned by the aggregate mean plus and minus some multiple, K, times the square root of the combined variance. By extension of Eqs. (1) and (3) for combined means and vari- ances, the combined mean for the elements is the sum of the means of the individual elements. In the case where the correlation be- tween the elements is assumed to be zero, then the aggregate variance is the sum of the variances of the individual elements. By selection of an appropriate value for K, we can determine a value of the aggregated elements that will accommodate a desired percent of the population. For example, we might want to calculate the value, V90 that will accommodate 90 percent of the population. In that case  V90 ¬º MTotal √æ K90  S2  Total  (20)  r  Ô¨ÉÔ¨ÉÔ¨ÉÔ¨ÉÔ¨ÉÔ¨ÉÔ¨ÉÔ¨ÉÔ¨ÉÔ¨ÉÔ¨ÉÔ¨ÉÔ¨ÉÔ¨ÉÔ¨ÉÔ¨ÉÔ¨É    We can determine the contribution of any individual element, A. With regard to the mean,  considered as not normally distributed (Wright and Herrington, 2011). The US Army anthropometric database (Gordon et al., 1989) has 132 anthropometric variables for females and for males. The skew of each variable was determined through use of the Excel skew function. For males, 118 variables have skew greater than zero and 14 have skew less than zero. For females, 122 have skew greater than zero and 10 have skew less than zero. For the total of 264 anthropometric variables for males and fe- males, 84 of the males‚Äô variables and 103 of the females‚Äô variables meet the criterion necessary to be described as not normally distributed, that is, where the absolute value of the skew value divided by the SES is greater than 2. Another measure of whether or not the data are normally distributed is the D‚ÄôAgostino-Pearson Omnibus Test (D‚ÄôAgostino and Pearson, 1973). This test uses both skew and kurtosis to determine whether or not a data set is normally distributed. Skew and kurtosis were determined for each variable using the Excel skew and kurtosis functions. The SES was calculated as previously described; the computation of the standard error of kurtosis and the D‚ÄôAgostino Pearson Omnibus Test were calculated as suggested by (Goldstein, 2013) using Excel. Using the omnibus test, 92 of the males‚Äô variables and 94 of the females‚Äô variables were found not normally distributed. Consequently, as it appears that the great majority of the anthropometric data for males and females are not nomally distributed, then using the Z score method of describing percentiles is problematic and not recommended, as the data cannot be treated as normally distributed.  5.1. Chebyshev‚Äôs inequality theorem as an alternate means of determining accommodation  However, an alternative method of reliably determining ac- commodation exists. Chebyshev‚Äôs inequality (Walpole and Myers, 1978) states that, for any data, regardless of distribution, the probability p that some data point will be more than K standard deviations from the mean can be expressed as  .  p  1  where 1   p is the proportion of the population that it is desired to accommodate and K is the number of standard deviations above and below the mean. As an example, if it is desired to accommodate 90% of a com- bined population, then the proportion to be accommodated is 0.9. Solving Eq. (18) with p set equal to 0.1 gives a value for K of 3.16. Chebyshev‚Äôs inequality reliably assures that 90% of the population will be within 3.16 standard deviations of the mean. Further, suppose that the designer wishes to accommodate all individuals up to and including the 90th percentile. Then the Chebyshev-Cantelli (Wikipedia, 2012) inequality for one-sided distributions states that the probability that some data point will be more than K standard deviations from the mean is  .     1   p  1  1 √æ K 2  K 2  (18)  MTotal ¬º MA √æ √∞MTotal   MA √û  and with regard to the variance    .

By relying on the Chebyshev-Cantelli inequality [18], a designer may be assured that he or she will accommodate 90 percent of all individuals, except for the group whose measurement exceeds the 90th percentile, if the criterion is set at three standard deviations from the mean.  5.3. A second method of estimating accommodation when normality of the anthropometric data cannot be assumed  In the special case where the median of the range of possible correlation values is zero, using the median correlation is  Please cite this article in press as: Albin, T.J., Vink, P., A method superior to adding percentiles when only limited anthropometric data such as percentile tables are available for design models, Applied Ergonomics (2014), http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2014.03.006  
6  T.J. Albin, P. Vink / Applied Ergonomics xxx (2014) 1e7  equivalent to assuming that the anthropometric elements are lin- early independent. If the elements are linearly independent, then the joint ac- commodation on any two variables is the product of the proba- bilities of their occurrence (percentiles/100), e.g. combining two 95th percentile elements will result in the accommodation of 0.952, or approximately 90 percent of the combined variables. If the percentiles used are the same for each anthropometric variable, then the joint accommodation on N elements is the percentile value used raised to the Nth power. This can be expressed as  P ¬º PN  V  (26)  where P is the proportion it is desired to accommodate, PV is the percentile value that it is necessary to use in order to achieve ac- commodation for the desired proportion of the population, and N is the number of variables that are to be combined. As N increases, PV must also increase. Table 2 shows the necessary percentile values that must be used to achieve 90 percent accommodation as N in- creases from 1 to 10. (Table 2). For example, suppose that an ergonomist or designer wishes to accommodate 90 percent of a population on each of 10 elements. He or she must then use the 99th percentile on each element in order to achieve 90 percent accommodation. If the 95th percentile value was used, then the expected proportion accommodated is 0.9510, or about 0.60.  6. A cautionary note regarding estimates of the variance of an anthropometric element when the variance or standard deviation are unspeciÔ¨Åed  The variance of an anthropometric element is often speciÔ¨Åed in the summary table of percentile values. However, if it is not spec- iÔ¨Åed it might be estimated empirically from the table values. For example, the difference between the 5th and 95th percentile values divided by 2 times the Z95 value, 1.645, gives an estimate of the standard deviation for normally distributed data. More generally, this can be expressed as    SA ¬º  95thPercentile A   5thPercentile A   .  √∞2Z95 √û  (27)  Unfortunately, as was discussed earlier, the anthropometric data are likely not normally distributed. This may be less of an issue when the anthropometric dataset used has been truncated. For example, the US military excludes very small or very large individuals. As a result, the military dataset contains fewer outliers and may be less skewed than the civilian population from which it is drawn. Observation of the difference between the Ô¨Åfth and 95th percentile values of anthropometric elements in ANSUR suggests that the difference between the 5th and 95th percentile values, divided by 3.29, provides a reasonable estimate of the standard deviation, accurate within about one percent. For a total of 264 ANSUR [6] anthropometric elements (132 male and 132 female), the average difference between the actual and the estimated value of the standard deviation using Eq. (27), as a percent of the actual standard deviation, is 1.2 percent and 1 percent, for females and males, respectively. However, the CAESAR database (Harrison and Robinette, 2002) is a civilian database and does not speciÔ¨Åcally exclude small or large individuals. As a result, the difference between the actual and estimated standard deviation for the CAESAR anthropometric data is much greater. The difference, when expressed as a percent of the actual standard deviation, is 11.5 percent for males and 11 percent for females. The CAESAR values used are those gathered using  traditional measurement techniques and presented in chapter 2 of the referenced document. There are 39 for males and 40 for females. Consequently, estimating the variance in this way should be done with great caution if at all, as it will produce only marginally approximate values when the data distribution is skewed.  7.  Conclusions  Although multivariate techniques such as Principle Component Analysis are more efÔ¨Åcient in the guidance that they offer for er- gonomists or designers seeking to model a dimension by combining two or more anthropometric elements, often sufÔ¨Åcient data or the tools necessary to use those techniques are not available to the ergonomist or designer. Combining percentiles is an alternate technique to produce combinations of anthropometric elements. However, as discussed earlier, combining percentiles is not an efÔ¨Åcient way to combine anthropometric elements as it commonly leads to substantial error and should be avoided. If the means, variances and inter-correlations of the anthropo- metric elements to be combined are known, then it is straightfor- ward to determine the combined mean and variance for any one pair of elements. Once the combined mean and variance are known, it is possible to determine the percent of the user population that is accommodated as a function of the mean and the standard devia- tion, using either a known underlying distribution model or the Chebyshev inequality if the underlying distribution of the anthro- pometric data is not known. As Roebuck (Roebuck, 1995) noted, a source of error in adding percentiles arises from a lack of knowledge of the correlation be- tween the anthropometric elements that are to be combined. This paper demonstrates that, when the correlation between two vari- ables is unknown, assuming that the correlation value is equal to the median or the mean of the range of possible correlation values substantially reduces the error in the estimate of the combined variance. Assuming the median or the mean correlation when combining variances produces more accurate models than does adding or subtracting percentiles. The underlying distribution of the anthropometric data is a second source of error in estimating the percent accommodation for a given user population. It is sometimes assumed that anthro- pometric data are normally distributed; however, as the analyses of the ANSUR data in Section 5 suggest, that may be a risky assump- tion. The great majority of all of the anthropometric elements in the ANSUR database appear not to be normally distributed. It is sus- pected, but not known, that other anthropometric data may also have non-normal distributions. Using the normal distribution z-values to determine the number of standard deviations above and below the mean necessary to accommodate a desired percent of the population likely adds error to the anthropometric model. However, in contrast, the Chebyshev theorem is distribution-free and allows a reliable statement of the number of standard deviations above and below the mean neces- sary to accommodate a desired percent of the user population regardless of the data distribution. Using the median correlation value and the Chebyshev theorem provides greater accuracy than does combining percentiles. When limited data prevent the use of more sophisticated modeling methods, this method should be used rather than adding or sub- tracting percentiles, as it produces more reliable accommodation interval estimates. However, the reliability comes at the cost of much wider accommodation intervals. It would be useful to study a larger sample of global anthropometric data to determine if a  Please cite this article in press as: Albin, T.J., Vink, P., A method superior to adding percentiles when only limited anthropometric data such as percentile tables are available for design models, Applied Ergonomics (2014), http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2014.03.006

European workers complain of backache as a result of performing work, with a further 22% complaining of muscular pains (Eurostat, 2010). An EU study on risk factors associated with MSDs concluded that construction workers were more likely to be exposed to a number of risk factors including work at high speeds, repetitive hand movement, carrying heavy loads, standing or walking, painful or tiring positions, or vibration, when compared to other sector workers (Eurostat, 2010).

However, the report only considers employees who are members of the regulated environment of the Irish Construction Industry Federation pension scheme. Anderson (1988) details trade worker activities that may be associated with MSDs. Many of these activities include typical construction activities such as sanding, grinding, hammering, carpentry, overhead work, turning screws, soldering, welding, use of hand tools, wiring, use of pliers, polishing, sawing, operating Ô¨Ånger triggers, jack hammering, use of vibrating tools, and working in a cold environment. It is not surprising that the incidence of MSDs in this industry is particularly high (Schneider, 1997). Albers et al. (2004), in a study of ergonomic interventions to reduce musculoskeletal loading in building installation tasks, identiÔ¨Åed a number of high risk tasks associated with the electrical and me- chanical trades. These included pulling cables/wires, attaching raceway to ceilings, positioning Ô¨Åxtures, and connecting wires. However, no reference is made to the variety and effects of the many access platforms used in the industry. The use of ladders in the workplace has long been identiÔ¨Åed as a signiÔ¨Åcant risk factor leading to workplace accidents. The safety concerns relating to ladders have been well documented and include the absence of fall protection for the user and the difÔ¨Åculty in securing fall restraints in the event of a fall. In the US, it was reported that 133 fatal ladder related falls occurred in 2004, with ladders accounting for 16% of workplace fall related fatalities (Lombard et al., 2011). Previous ergonomic studies on ladders have focused on climbing/handling of ladders (Bloswick and ChafÔ¨Ån, 1990; Imbeau et al., 1998; Hoozemans et al., 2005). Ladder handling was identiÔ¨Åed as a signiÔ¨Åcant risk hazard for MSDs within the telecommunication sector (Imbeau et al., 1998). This included loading/unloading of ladders from vehicles and the positioning of ladders onto the shoulder. Overexertion was considered a risk factor in the handling of ladders (24e31 kgs). However, no refer- ence is made to ergonomic risks of work on ladders. Bloswick and ChafÔ¨Ån (1990) examined the ergonomic implications of ladder climbing activities using EMG of the erector spinae muscle group with biomechanical modelling of compressive and shear forces at L5/S1. They concluded that fast climbing resulted in 35% greater EMG activity than slow climbing for the torso muscles, and that erector spinae EMG activity almost reached the maximum during a fast climb, but no data were presented on shoulder muscle activity. Hoozemans et al. (2005) examined the effect of differing rung separation on perceived exertion, discomfort, safety and mechan- ical loading of the lower joints during ladder ascending and descending, but the study did not include the effects of performing tasks using the ladder as a platform. The stepladder is a very common feature on the majority of construction sites in Ireland, used by craftspersons when per- forming work at height. The popularity of the stepladder is likely to be inÔ¨Çuenced by its versatility and low relative economic cost. The use of Mobile Elevated Work Platforms (MEWPs) on construction sites is also very common. MEWPs are self propelled machines that are capable of raising a working platform to the desired working height. Irish health and safety legislation (HSA, 2007a) recognises that work at height can be performed safely using a wide range of work equipment, but guidance favours the use of MEWPs over ladders (HSA, 2007b). On MEWPs, the risk of an operator falling is minimised as the operator is contained within a double handrail. Additionally, in the event of a fall, the operator is secured if a body harness is worn. It is clear that MEWPs are a preferred method for accessing work at height compared to ladders due to their safety features in preventing falls from height. However, it is unclear if MEWPs are also preferable in preventing MSDs during overhead work. A review of the literature indicated no previous studies comparing the use of MEWPs to ladders on risks of MSDs for  overhead work. The MEWP provides a working platform, typically about 1.0  2.0 m, thus allowing the user a stable base to move while performing construction tasks. Additionally, the height of the platform can be adjusted with ease as per the user‚Äôs preference. The purpose of this study was to compare work on a ladder versus a MEWP for three different tasks on shoulder muscle loading and discomfort, and also task performance. Part I reports on plat- form type usage on a commercial construction site at a point in time. Part II was a simulated study of commercial electrical work to compare the effect of working on ladders versus MEWPs on shoulder EMG, discomfort, and task performance. The hypothesis of this study was that work on ladders would lead to greater muscle loading demands, increased discomfort and lower levels of per- formance than on a MEWP, due to both the posture and balance constraints required for ladder work and the stable platform and reduced balance requirements on MEWPs.  2.

Part I: Ô¨Åeld study of discomfort  The survey was performed at a construction site of a large pharmaceutical plant in Ireland. Site management approved the study. Labour levels peaked at approximately 400 personnel with up to 60 electricians at any one time. The electricians on site (all male) were presented with details of the survey during their morning meetings and invited to participate. Twenty electricians agreed to participate in the one day study from a workforce of 30 on the day of sampling. One had to leave the site during the day giving a sample size of 19. The survey comprised a simple checklist of broad work activities and location by time segment (15 min) which the participants completed as the day progressed. The work activities on the checklist were as follows:   Working on ladder  Working on a MEWP  Working on other access platform  Electrical work from ground  Completing safety documentation/retrieving materials  Other (please state)  A modiÔ¨Åed version of the Corlett and Bishop (1976) body part discomfort rating method was used to record perceived discomfort at the end of the working day in the neck, shoulders, upper arms, lower arms, lower trunk and upper trunk. The main difference was the use of a 100 mm visual analogue scale with anchors of ‚Äúno discomfort‚Äù on the left and ‚Äúextreme discomfort‚Äù on the right, as per Carey and Gallwey (2002, 2005).  2.2.

Participants 7e12 did the reverse treatment orders of the Ô¨Årst six participants. The treatments were simulated tasks comprising combinations of three electrical construction tasks (drilling, cabling and assem- bly), with both access platforms (ladders and MEWP) in a workshop environment. The tasks selected were identiÔ¨Åed as routine elec- trical activities during the Ô¨Åeld study. Participants were instructed to perform each task for a period of 5 min followed by a rest period of 5 min between tasks, as per Carey and Gallwey (2002, 2005) and Mukhopadhyay et al. (2007). In order to represent the actual practice as performed on construction sites, the participants were instructed to set the ladder/MEWP position to suit their individual preference. Fig. 1 is a photograph of a participant on the MEWP.  2.2.1.1. Drilling task . The drilling task required participants to drill a 100 mm medium density concrete block using an electric drill and a 14 mm masonry drill bit. Performance was measured from the amount drilled in mm. A new concrete block was used for each participant.  2.2.1.2.  Cabling  task . The  cable task involved feeding a 10 mm diameter power cable through a series of brackets mounted on a wall. The length of cable pulled (metres) during 5 min was the measure of performance.  2.2.1.3. Assembly task . A 10 mm threaded bar was Ô¨Åxed to the wall for the assembly task. Participants used their dominant hand to move a nut from the outside edge of the bar towards the wall. The distance each nut was threaded (mm) during the 5 min was the measure of performance.  2.2.2.  EMG equipment and data reduction  Muscle activity from the upper trapezius and anterior deltoid muscles was measured using bipolar surface EMG. A Nexus 10 portable EMG system (Mind Media) with Bluetooth connectivity recorded the EMG signals. The sampling frequency was set at 1024 Hz with a band pass Ô¨Ålter set to 20e500 Hz in the software. The sampling window was set at 0.5 s (512 samples) with a 25%  Fig. 1. Photo of a participant on the MEWP cabling.  Fig. 2. Mean discomfort (√æ1SD) by body region.  overlap. The Root Mean Square (RMS) calculation was applied to the raw EMG to determine signal amplitude. Maximal Voluntary Exertions (MVEs) were performed for both muscles at the start of the experiment and signal amplitudes from these recordings were used to convert the signals from experi- mental treatments to percentages of MVE. Percentiles (50th and 90th) of the MVE data from the Amplitude Probability Distribution Function (APDF) were determined for each recording, as per Vasseljen and Westgaard (1995). The 50th percentile is indicative of the median EMG activity amplitude during the treatment whereas the 90th percentile is indicative of peak EMG activity.  2.2.3.  Procedure  The participants completed the informed consent form and were briefed on the nature of the experiment and what it involved. The EMG electrodes were attached over the upper trapezius and anterior deltoid muscles on their dominant side. The guidance of SENIAM (1999) was followed in preparing the skin and the guid- ance of Delagi et al. (1980) was followed in positioning the elec- trodes. The signal quality was tested and EMG signals were recorded for MVE exertions of both muscles. The participants familiarised themselves with the tasks prior to commencement, including operation of the MEWP and positioning of the platform as per the task. Participants self selected their preferred working height on both platforms. It was necessary to control the pace of the simulated work as it is known to affect discomfort for the upper limb in simulated tasks (Finneran and O‚ÄôSullivan, 2013). As such, the participants in repetitive tasks were instructed to ‚Äúperform the task at a pace they felt they could maintain for an 8 h day‚Äù (as per Finneran and O‚ÄôSullivan, 2010). This was expected to approximately result in an activity equating to a "

According to the United States national data, back injury accounts for 42% of all reported occupational musculoskeletal disorders with even higher rates reported from occupations that involve manual handling tasks such as nurses (53%), nursing aides (55%), and la- borers (44%) (BLS, 2012).  1  * Corresponding author.

When the human trunk experiences sudden loading, both reÔ¨Çexive and voluntary muscle contractions are initiated to increase stability and regain balance (Cholewicki et al., 1997). However, such instantaneous muscle reactions elevate spi- nal compression (Granata and Marras, 2000) especially when the load is unexpected (Marras et al., 1987). Previous studies have re- ported that the magnitude of mechanical loading on spine (such as spinal compression and shear forces) is directly associated with the risk of back injuries (Bakker et al., 2007; Norman et al., 1998). When such loading exceeds the tolerance limit, tissue damage may occur (Marras, 2000). Therefore, to mitigate the risk of back injury during manual handling, it is critical to develop load coping strategies that can reduce the biomechanical impacts to the spine caused by sudden loading. A number of protective strategies have been previously inves- tigated. Studies have shown that the presence of warning signals prior to a sudden loading event signiÔ¨Åcantly reduced the average muscle activation level by 49.8% (Lavender et al., 1989), reduced the spinal compression force by 16% (Lavender and Marras, 1995), and increased spinal stability (Mawston et al., 2007). In addition, appropriate training practices and increased experience helped reduce spinal compression force by 29% and peak L5/S1 joint moment by 25% (Lavender et al., 1993; Lawrence et al., 2005).

2  X. Ning et al.  / Applied Ergonomics xxx (2014) 1e7  recent study discovered that maintaining a staggered foot stance during the impact of sudden loading could signiÔ¨Åcantly reduce trunk Ô¨Çexion angle by 4.1 and L5/S1 joint moment by 6.6 Nm compare to parallel stance (Zhou et al., 2013). Although the above methods have been explored to develop protective strategies to cope with sudden loading, the effect of load handling position on trunk biomechanics has not been investigated. Granata and colleagues discovered elevated trunk muscle co- activation with an increase of load vertical height when perform- ing static weight holding tasks (Granata and Orishimo, 2001). Such an increase of trunk muscle activity enhances trunk stiffness and stability; however, it also increases spinal loading and the associ- ated risk of back injury (Lavender et al., 1993). Another study explored the impact of sudden loading on trunk biomechanical responses during stoop lifting. Results of that study discovered signiÔ¨Åcantly larger postural disturbance and spinal loading when the subject experienced sudden loading in more Ô¨Çexed trunk pos- tures (i.e. lower load height) (Chow et al., 2003). Furthermore, asymmetric lifting has been shown to elevate the risk of LBP due to increased torsional and spinal shear loadings caused by axial trunk rotation and lateral bending (Waters et al., 1993). However, much less is known regarding the biomechanical impact of a sudden loading from an asymmetric direction. One study investigated the effect of load dropping direction (symmetric or asymmetric) on trunk muscle activity and found 37% increase and 55% decrease in muscle activation levels of contralateral and ipsilateral trunk extensor muscles respectively when load was dropped from an asymmetric direction (Lavender et al., 1989). However, in that study the dropping load had a larger moment arm in the asymmetric condition and spinal loading was not estimated. A recent study investigated the impact of an asymmetrically released hand load on the biomechanical responses of human trunk when standing still and facing forward (i.e. without trunk rotation) (Zhou et al., 2013). Interestingly, the results of this study demon- strated that when trunk rotation is eliminated and load moment arm is controlled, an asymmetrically released load caused smaller trunk Ô¨Çexion and L5/S1 joint moment in comparison to load released from a symmetric position. Despite the previous evidence, however, the potential interaction effect between the load releasing height and horizontal position (i.e. asymmetry) on trunk biomechanical responses during sudden loading has not been investigated. The present study was designed to understand whether load handling position can be used in the design of protective strategies against back injuries caused by sudden loading. More speciÔ¨Åcally,  the objective of the current study was to investigate the effects of load handling height and load asymmetry (created by arm rotation but not trunk rotation) on trunk biomechanical responses when experiencing sudden loading. According to the previous Ô¨Åndings, we hypothesized that one will experience greater spinal compression force, but smaller postural perturbation when a load is handled at a higher position and released suddenly. As suggested by previous research (Zhou et al., 2013), we expect to observe smaller trunk Ô¨Çexion when the load is handled and suddenly released from an asymmetrical position than in a symmetrical position.  2. Method  2.1.  Subjects  Eleven male subjects with mean (SD) height, mass, and age of 176.6 (3.4) cm, 71.2 (6.5) kg, and 26.7 (2.0) years respectively vol- unteered to participate in this study. Subjects with no previous training or working experience in manual material handling were recruited from the student population of West Virginia University, and none reported a previous history of low back pain or upper/ lower limb injuries. The experimental procedure was approved by the university‚Äôs Research Integrity and Compliance Committee.  2.2.  Experimental design  Two independent variables were involved in the current experimental design: vertical load handling position (HEIGHT, three levels) and transverse load handling position (ASYM, two levels). These two independent variables collectively describe the location of both hands and the load (the load was always in the hands (Fig. 1) before the sudden releasing event). In all testing conditions, trunk remained forward facing. The three HEIGHT levels were deÔ¨Åned with respect to participants‚Äô anthropometry: ‚ÄòHigh‚Äô (eyebrow level: the initial holding height of the load aligns with the height of eyebrows), ‚ÄòMiddle‚Äô (shoulder level: the initial holding height of the load aligns with the height of clavicle bone), and ‚ÄòLow‚Äô (umbilicus level: the initial holding height of the load aligns with the height of umbilicus). The two ASYM load positions were: ‚ÄòSymmetry‚Äô (in the midsagittal plane) and ‚ÄòAsymmetry‚Äô (45 leftward to the midsagittal plane). The effect of transverse load handling location has been previously investigated (Zhou et al., 2013). In the current study the interaction between HEIGHT and ASYM was explored.

X. Ning et al.  / Applied Ergonomics xxx (2014) 1e7  3  variables created six different load handling positions (Fig. 1). To control the effect of distance of the load on spinal loading, the straight line distance between the projected location of the load center of mass and the center of the subjects‚Äô ankles were kept constant at 45 cm across all conditions. Each subject performed a total of 24 trials (four repetitions for each of the 6 conditions) with the sequence completely randomized. Three dependent variables were considered in the current study: 1. Increase of trunk Ô¨Çexion angle: the magnitude of increase in trunk Ô¨Çexion angle from initial trunk posture to the peak trunk Ô¨Çexion during the sudden loading; 2. Increase of L5/S1 joint moment: the difference between the initial joint moment and the maximum joint moment during the sudden loading; 3. Peak L5/S1 joint compression: the maximum spinal compressive force during the sudden loading as computed by an EMG-assisted biomechan- ical model (described in detail in the ‚ÄòBiomechanical model‚Äô section below).  2.3. Apparatus and equipment  A wood structure was created to hang the load at different height levels. The load was made from standard disc weights and secured through their centre holes using a polyvinyl chloride (PVC) pipe which also served as a handle for subjects to hold (Zhou et al., 2013). The total weight of the load was 6.8 kg (15 lbs). A surface electromyography (EMG) system (Model: Bagnoli, Delsys Inc, Boston, MA, USA) was used to record EMG signals at 1000 Hz from eight trunk muscles: left and right rectus abdominis (electrodes placed 2 cm above the umbilicus and 3 cm from the midline of the abdomen); left and right external obliques (10 cm from the midline of the abdomen and 4 cm above the ilium with an angle of 45 to the midline of the abdomen); left and right erector spinae (4 cm from the midline of L3 vertebra); left and right mul- tiÔ¨Ådus (2 cm from the midline of L4 vertebra). An eight camera (MX-13 series) 3D optical motion tracking system (Vicon, Nexus, Oxford, UK) was used to capture trunk and upper extremity kine- matics at a sampling frequency of 100 Hz. Eleven reÔ¨Çective markers were placed over the following positions: C7, T12, and L5 vertebrae; the most dorsal point of the acromioclavicular joint of the left and right shoulders; the most caudal point of the lateral epicondyle of the left and right elbows; the ulnar side of both wrists; the middle of the third metacarpal bone on both hands. Nexus 10.7 software (Vicon, Nexus, Oxford, UK) was used to record and synchronize both EMG and kinematics data. During the trunk muscle maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) trials, a lumbar dynamometer (Humac Norm, CSMi, MA, USA) and the attached back Ô¨Çexion-extension module were used to restrict subjects‚Äô pelvis and lower extremity and provide static resistance against trunk muscle maximum exertions.  2.4.  Procedure  The experimental procedure was Ô¨Årst explained to the subjects and the signed informed consent was obtained. A brief warm-up session was provided after the measurement of subjects‚Äô basic anthropometric data (body stature, mass, trunk length (from L5/S1 joint to the top of head), width (at iliac and xiphiod process levels) and depth (at iliac and xiphiod process levels)) to warm up muscles and have subjects practice the sudden loading tasks and familiarize with the experiment protocol. Eight bi-polar EMG surface elec- trodes were then attached to the skin of the aforementioned muscles after the skin was swabbed with alcohol. At the beginning of the data collection subjects Ô¨Årst performed three repetitions of a 20 isometric maximum trunk extension/Ô¨Çexion exertions at trunk Ô¨Çexion posture against a static resistance provided by the  dynamometer. Each MVC exertion lasted for 5 s and at least 2 min of rest was provided between repetitions to prevent muscle fatigue. EMG signals recorded during the MVC trials were later used to normalize the experimental EMG data. Following the MVC trials, eleven reÔ¨Çective markers were Ô¨Åtted to the aforementioned locations and subjects then performed all 24 experimental trials in a completely randomized order. During data collection, subjects were instructed to stand straight and hold the load such that the distance between the projected location of the center of the load and the midpoint of the subjects‚Äô ankles remained constant (45 cm) among all conditions and trials (controlled by labels on the ground and assistance from experi- menters). In the current study, elbow joint angles were not controlled in order to achieve designated postures. In asymmetrical load position conditions, subjects rotated their arms leftward, kept their torso forward and maintained the same horizontal load dis- tance as in the symmetrical conditions. In each trial, subjects stood with eyes closed, feet shoulder width apart, and were required to hold the load Ô¨Årmly but without supporting the weight of the load; the load was then suddenly released by an experimenter without notice (Fig. 1). Subjects were instructed to immediately arrest the falling load, carry it back to approximately its original position, and hold it stably at this position for 3 s. At least 2 min of rest was provided between trials to prevent muscle fatigue.  2.5. Data processing and analysis  EMG signals were Ô¨Årst Ô¨Åltered (band-pass Ô¨Åltered between 10 and 500 Hz and notch Ô¨Åltered at 60 Hz and its aliases) and rectiÔ¨Åed, then smoothed with a 200 sample (0.2 s) sliding window. EMG signals from all experimental trials were then normalized with respect to the maximum EMG activities collected during MVC trials for each muscle. The exported three dimensional coordination data of the reÔ¨Çective markers were used to calculate trunk and upper extremity kinematics. The trunk Ô¨Çexion angle was deÔ¨Åned as the angle formed by the line connecting the C7 and L5 reÔ¨Çective markers and the transverse plane (Ning et al., 2011).  2.6.  Biomechanical model  In the present study, the external moment at the L5/S1 joint was estimated using a multi-segment dynamic model in which seven body segments (trunk, left and right upper arm, forearm, and hand) and the external load were included. The mass and center of mass of all body segments were estimated according to previous work (Pheasant, 1986). A previously established and validated EMG- assisted biomechanical model (Marras and Granata, 1997) was used to calculate the muscle forces and the corresponding internal moment and spinal compression force at the L5/S1 joint. In this model, L5/S1 joint internal moment was estimated using equation (1), in which ‚ÄúGaini‚Äù, ‚ÄúNEMGi‚Äù and ‚ÄúAi‚Äù represent muscle gain value, the normalized EMG and muscle cross-sectional area of trunk muscle i respectively; ‚Äúf(li)‚Äù and ‚Äúf(vi)‚Äù are the muscle force-length and force-velocity modulation factors of muscle respectively (Davis et al., 1998; Marras and Granata, 1997). These Ô¨Åve factors can be used to estimate force generated by muscle i. The additional factor ‚Äúri‚Äù is the moment arm vector of the trunk muscle i. The L5/S1 joint compression forces were estimated according to trunk muscle forces, trunk kinematics and geometry (e.g. line of action). The subject-speciÔ¨Åed moment arms (r) and cross sectional areas (A) of the trunk muscles considered in the model were estimated using the predictive equations from earlier studies (Jorgensen et al., 2001; Marras et al., 2001) with the measured anthropometry (body height, mass; trunk length, width and depth) as inputs. The maximum muscle stress (gain) value was then determined by  i  Please cite this article in press as: Ning, X., et al., The assessment of material handling strategies in dealing with sudden loading: The effects of load handling position on trunk biomechanics, Applied Ergonomics (2014), http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2014.03.008

Statistical analysis  Minitab statistical software (Minitab v.15, Minitab Inc., Penn- sylvania, USA) was used for all statistical analyses. The assumptions of the ANOVA were Ô¨Årst tested (Montgomery, 2005). Dependent variables that violated the assumptions were transformed using deterministic mathematical function. When all assumptions were satisÔ¨Åed, multivariate analyses of variance (MANOVAs) were per- formed to reveal the statistical signiÔ¨Åcance of independent vari- ables HEIGHT and ASYM as well as their interaction effect on all dependent variables. Variables with signiÔ¨Åcant effects were then analyzed using repeated measures ANOVA with ‚Äòsubject‚Äô consid- ered as a blocking factor. Finally, TukeyeKramer post-hoc tests were conducted on dependent variables that were signiÔ¨Åcantly affected by HEIGHT to further investigate the differences between each two HEIGHT levels. The criteria p-value was set as 0.05 for all statistical tests.  3. Results  Results of MANOVA revealed signiÔ¨Åcant effects of HEIGHT, ASYM, and their interaction. Univariate ANOVA results demon- strated that both HEIGHT and ASYM signiÔ¨Åcantly affected all three dependent variables. Only the increase of trunk Ô¨Çexion angle and L5/S1 joint moment were signiÔ¨Åcantly inÔ¨Çuenced by the interactive effects between HEIGHT and ASYM (Table 1). The effects of HEIGHT on all dependent variables are demon- strated in Figs. 2 to 4. A signiÔ¨Åcant increase of the peak L5/S1 joint compression force (on average from 2111N to 2486N) was observed with an increase of load height (Fig. 2). Reduced trunk Ô¨Çexion was also observed (on average from 6.5 to 3.8 ) with an increase in load height (Fig. 3). Finally, signiÔ¨Åcantly a greater L5/S1 joint moment (83.5 Nm) was observed at the ‚ÄòMiddle‚Äô height condition, while the difference between ‚ÄòLow‚Äô and ‚ÄòHigh‚Äô conditions was not statistically signiÔ¨Åcant (Fig. 4). The effects of ASYM on all dependent variables are shown in Table 2. SigniÔ¨Åcantly smaller increases of trunk Ô¨Çexion angle, L5/S1 moment, and peak L5/S1 joint compression force were found under the ‚ÄòAsymmetry‚Äô condition. Furthermore, signiÔ¨Åcant interaction effects between HEIGHT and ASYM for the increase of trunk Ô¨Çexion angle and L5/S1 joint moment were observed (Fig. 5 and Fig. 6). In the ‚ÄòSymmetry‚Äô condition, the increase of load height resulted in smaller increase of trunk Ô¨Çexion. However, in the ‚ÄòAsymmetry‚Äô condition the largest increase of trunk Ô¨Çexion was found in the ‚ÄòMiddle‚Äô condition. As showing in Fig. 6 the largest L5/S1 joint moment was observed in the ‚ÄòMiddle‚Äô height condition in both ASYM conditions. However, the smallest L5/S1 joint moments were found in the ‚ÄòHigh‚Äô and ‚ÄòLow‚Äô levels in symmetric and asymmetric  postures, respectively. These data also further indicated that the main effect of ASYM is primarily caused by the differences in the ‚ÄòHigh‚Äô and ‚ÄòLow‚Äô levels, but less by the variation in the ‚ÄòMiddle‚Äô level. In addition to the three dependent variables, several related kinematics variables were also analyzed. We found that HEIGHT signiÔ¨Åcantly affected the magnitude of arm rotation (changes of sagittal angle from initial arm posture to the maximum downward arm rotation during sudden loading), initial trunk posture, initial load moment arm and the change of moment arm about L5/S1 joint (changes of load moment arm from initial posture to the point where peak moment was observed). As showing in Table 3, signiÔ¨Åcantly greater arm rotations were observed in the ‚ÄòHigh‚Äô and ‚ÄòMiddle‚Äô height levels, compared with the ‚ÄòLow‚Äô level. SigniÔ¨Åcantly smaller initial trunk Ô¨Çexion angle was observed in the ‚ÄòLow‚Äô than the ‚ÄòMiddle‚Äô and ‚ÄòHigh‚Äô HEIGHT conditions. Initial load moment arm about L5/S1 joint was signiÔ¨Åcantly smaller in the ‚ÄòHigh‚Äô level than the ‚ÄòMiddle‚Äô and ‚ÄòLow‚Äô levels. During the sudden loading event, the peak L5/S1 moment occurred with reduced load moment arm (the load is closer to the body) in the ‚ÄòLow‚Äô level, but increased load moment arm (the load is further away from the body) in the ‚ÄòMiddle‚Äô and ‚ÄòHigh‚Äô levels.

To explain our results, muscle EMG data were also examined. Normalized EMG (NEMG) (with respect to MVC) data prior to the sudden loading event were Ô¨Årst examined, results showed that the average (SD) activities of erector spinae and multiÔ¨Ådus are 4.8% (0.2%) and 4.1% (0.2%), respectively, which indicated that the back extensor muscles were relatively relaxed before the sudden loading event (Jin et al., 2012). In addition, the effect of HEIGHT on the trunk muscle peak NEMG during sudden loading was also investigated. Results demonstrated signiÔ¨Åcantly elevated muscle activities among back extensor muscles and external oblique with the in- crease of HEIGHT (Fig. 7).  4. Discussion  ConÔ¨Årming our initial hypotheses, results of the present study demonstrated increased spinal compression force and reduced trunk Ô¨Çexion at higher load handling positions. These results can be explained by the stability and muscle co-contraction levels asso- ciated with different load handling height conditions. An earlier study demonstrated that the increase of load height elevated trunk muscle co-contraction during static weight holding due to reduced trunk stability (Granata and Orishimo, 2001); this increased trunk muscle activity would consequently increase spinal compression (Granata and Marras, 2000). Results of the current study supported the previous Ô¨Åndings (Fig. 7). Because of the strong positive asso- ciation between spinal compression and the occurrence of low back injury (Kerr et al., 2001); our results indicated that handling load at lower height (i.e. the umbilicus level) helps reduce the risk of back injury when experiencing sudden loading during material handling. The increase of load handling height also resulted in smaller trunk Ô¨Çexion (Fig. 3). As we have discussed above, the increase of load handling height may elevate the trunk muscle co-contraction (Granata and Orishimo, 2001), which results in higher global trunk  stiffness, and smaller trunk bending under external impact (Granata and Marras, 2000). On the other hand, the magnitude of sagittal arm rotation may have also inÔ¨Çuenced trunk motion during sudden loading. As is shown in Table 3, signiÔ¨Åcantly larger arm rotations were observed in the ‚ÄòHigh‚Äô and ‚ÄòMiddle‚Äô height levels; such an increase in arm rotation may compensate for trunk motion and result in reduced trunk Ô¨Çexion. In the current study the largest increase of L5/S1 joint moment was observed at the ‚ÄòMiddle‚Äô height level (Fig. 4). According to the multi-segment model, the external moment on the L5/S1 joint is affected by the magnitude of external loads and their correspond- ing moment arms. In-depth analysis of the kinematic data revealed that even though the horizontal distance between the load and the centre of ankles was controlled, subjects maintained slightly extended initial trunk postures when grasping load in the ‚ÄòHigh‚Äô condition. This posture increased lumbar lordosis and decreased the initial moment arm between the L5/S1 joint and the load. Such reduction in moment arm could result in a smaller moment during sudden loading. In addition, although the initial moment arms of the external load were similar between the ‚ÄòLow‚Äô and ‚ÄòMiddle‚Äô levels, when releasing the load from the ‚ÄòLow‚Äô position the natural arm rotation brought the load closer to the human body which decreased the moment arm (an average decrease of 33.3 mm from the initial posture to the point that peak moment was observed) of the external load. In contrast, moment arms increased during sudden loading in both ‚ÄòMiddle‚Äô and ‚ÄòHigh‚Äô levels (on average  High  Middle  Low  90  85  80  75  70I  n  e r c  a  s  e  o  f  L  5  /  S  1  j  o  i  n  t  m  o  m  e  n  t  (  N  m  )  A  A  B  Fig. 4.

Conse- quently, the changes of moment arms in different conditions largely determined the results of the L5/S1 joint moment. Results of the present study demonstrated a signiÔ¨Åcantly smaller increase of trunk Ô¨Çexion angle, L5/S1 joint moment, and peak L5/S1 joint compression force in the ‚ÄòAsymmetry‚Äô load releasing position than the ‚ÄòSymmetry‚Äô position (Table 2). These results were in agreement with the Ô¨Åndings of a previous study (Zhou et al., 2013). It has been suggested that asymmetric trunk posture increases torsional and lateral moment during lifting, therefore elevate the risk of back injury (Hooper et al., 1998). However the asymmetric load handling posture tested in the cur- rent study did not involved trunk twisting motion (subjects were instructed to always face forward). Therefore, minor changes in spinal shear loading (both anterior-posterior and lateral shear forces) were generated due to the relatively small magnitude of posture perturbations (e.g. on average 5.0 degrees of trunk Ô¨Çexion). It should be noted that the current results only stand when handling relatively light load (e.g. 6.8 kg) with the forward facing trunk postures. It is very likely that when handling a heavier load in Ô¨Çexed and/or rotated trunk postures, the sudden impact from an asymmetric direction could generate much higher torsional and shear spinal loading thereby elevates the risk of back injury. Interestingly, a signiÔ¨Åcant interaction effect between HEIGHT and ASYM was also observed (Figs. 5 and 6). In the ‚ÄòSymmetry‚Äô condition, the increase of load height consistently reduced the magnitude of trunk Ô¨Çexion. However in the ‚ÄòAsymmetry‚Äô condition  the largest trunk Ô¨Çexion was found in the ‚ÄòMiddle‚Äô condition instead of in ‚ÄòLow‚Äô condition (Fig. 5). In addition, the largest L5/S1 joint moment was consistently found in the ‚ÄòMiddle‚Äô height con- dition in both ASYM conditions. However, the smallest L5/S1 joint moments were found in the ‚ÄòLow‚Äô and ‚ÄòHigh‚Äô conditions when holding the load in asymmetric and symmetric postures, respec- tively (Fig. 6). In asymmetric load positions, the direction of load and the sagittal plane formed a 45 external angle, which resulted in shorter moment arms to the rotation axis of sagittal trunk Ô¨Çexion than in symmetric conditions; therefore sudden loading in asymmetric conditions could generate less trunk Ô¨Çexion which was supported by the previous study (Zhou et al., 2013). In the current study this effect was more pronounced when holding the load at the ‚ÄòLow‚Äô condition with lower trunk Ô¨Çexion angle and the resultant L5/S1 moment observed. There are several noteworthy limitations of the present study. First, due to the relatively small trunk Ô¨Çexion during sudden loading, only spinal compression force was evaluated. More comprehensive spinal loading (compression force, shear force and torsional force etc.) should be assessed in future studies especially when experiencing larger trunk posture perturbations. Second, in the current study, the horizontal distance between the external load and the mid-point of the ankles was controlled to help maintain constant initial moment arm from the centre of the load to the L5/S1 joint. However this purpose was not attained due to the slight trunk hyperextension postures subjects maintained in higher load handling positions. Although our results are very unlikely to be caused by these changes (despite having the greatest spinal compression, the load moment arm in ‚ÄòHigh‚Äô condition (487.5 mm) was even smaller than the ‚ÄòMiddle‚Äô and ‚ÄòLow‚Äô conditions (518.7 and 515.0 mm respectively), but we observed the greatest spinal compression in the ‚ÄúHigh‚Äù condition (Table 3)). Third, this study was conducted in a controlled lab environment with all subjects recruited from the student population, and a comparatively light load (6.8 kg) was used. The response of experienced workers to a much heavier load in a real working environment warrants future investigation. Forth, in the current study the asymmetric load po- sition was created by rotating arms toward the left side of the body, yet the impact of handedness was not considered.  )  C V  M  %  (  G  M  E  N  60  50  40  30  20  10  0  C  B  A  B  B  A  B  B  A  Low  Middle  High  Low  Middle  High  Low  Middle  High  Low  Middle  High  ES  MU  RA  EO  Fig. 7.

Conclusion  The results of the present study provided important information regarding the impact of sudden loading on trunk biomechanical responses when handling load at different height and asymmetry positions. And it must be noted again that the straight line distance between the load and the centre of ankles was kept constant in all experimental conditions, and asymmetric posture was formed by rotating arms while keeping trunk facing forward. According to our results, it was concluded that handling sudden loading at a lower (e.g. umbilicus) height could help reduce the risk of low back injury compared with the other tested height levels. The asymmetric loading handling position generated by arm rotation resulted in smaller spinal compression and L5/S1 joint moment, however, its impact on torsional and shear spinal loading needs further investigation.

Previous studies have shown that a keyboard‚Äôs key acti- vation force, travel distance, force-displacement characteristics, and tactile feedback can affect typing forces, muscle activity, muscle fatigue and discomfort in the upper extremities (Gerard et al., 1999; Lee et al., 2009; Marcus et al., 2002; Martin et al., 1996; Radwin and Ruffalo, 1999; Rempel et al., 1997; Rempel et al., 1999). Although the strength of relationships between key activation force and typing force varies across studies (Sommerich et al., 1996a), typing forces have been shown to be directly asso- ciated with keyboard key activation force (Armstrong et al., 1994; Lee et al., 2009; Radwin and Jeng, 1997; Radwin and Ruffalo, 1999; Rempel et al., 1999). These previous studies have found  * Corresponding author. Northern Illinois University, 590 Garden Road, EB 240, IL 60115, USA. Tel.: √æ1 815 753 9971; fax: √æ1 815 753 0823.

As tablet use is becoming increasingly common, conventional keyboards are being replaced by virtual, touchscreen keyboards with no physical key feedback. Due to the increased presence of tablets and the associated increase in virtual keyboard use, it is important to understand how the use of a virtual keyboard may affect typing productivity and the physical risk factors associated with MSDs. A touchscreen keyboard is completely different from conventional physical keyboards in terms of key feedback charac- teristics. Since most standard physical keyboards have a narrow range of activation forces, typically between 0.5 and 0.8 N, users can rest their Ô¨Ångers on the keyboard keys. However, because keys on a virtual keyboard are activated by any physical contact with the skin, users are unable to rest their Ô¨Ångers on the keyboard and must Ô¨Çoat their Ô¨Ångers, hands, and wrist to avoid accidental key activation. As this hand and Ô¨Ånger Ô¨Çoating could lead to prolonged static loading in the Ô¨Ånger/forearm extensors and shoulder muscles, the associ- ated risks for MSDs may increase whilst using a virtual keyboard. Furthermore, because a virtual keyboard provides limited tactile  Please cite this article in press as: Kim, J.H., et al., Differences in typing forces, muscle activity, comfort, and typing performance among virtual, notebook, and desktop keyboards, Applied Ergonomics (2014), http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2014.04.001

Kim et al.  / Applied Ergonomics xxx (2014) 1e8  feedback without key travel and force-displacement characteris- tics, there may be differences in typing productivity and typing forces relative to conventional keyboards which provide users with some sort of tactile feedback. With the relatively recent introduction of tablets, there has been very little research on how a touchscreen virtual keyboard may affect typing force exposures, muscle activity, user comfort, and typing performance. Young et al. (2013) examined the wrist posture and forearm muscle activity during touchscreen tablet use and found that a touchscreen table use can increase risks for MSDs. Another study (Shin and Zhu, 2011) evaluated the physical risk factors associated with touchscreen keyboard use in a desktop computer setting. They showed that using a touchscreen increased muscle activity in the shoulder and neck muscles, and increased self-reported discomfort in the Ô¨Ångers, shoulder and neck. How- ever, it is still unknown whether using a virtual keyboard affects typing forces and the load on Ô¨Ånger Ô¨Çexor, extensor, and shoulder muscles differently than a conventional computer keyboard. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to determine whether there are differences in typing forces, Ô¨Ånger and shoulder muscle activity, self-reported comfort and typing productivity between a virtual keyboard which has no tactile-based switches and physical key travel and conventional computer keyboards with tactile (forceedisplacement) feedback.  2. Method  2.1.  Subjects  A total of 19 subjects (10 male and 9 female) were recruited to participate in the study through e-mail solicitations. Seventeen subjects were right hand dominant and all subjects were experi- enced touch typists with no history of upper extremity musculo- skeletal disorders. The average (SD) age and typing speed for all subjects was 24.3 (6.4) years and 62.7 (9.8) words per minute (WPM), respectively. The typing speed was collected using an on- line typing test program (http://www.typeonline.co.uk) with sub- ject‚Äôs own conventional keyboard during subject recruitment. Their average (SD) experience using computer was 14.1 (5.5) years; and all subjects were current virtual keyboard users with either smart phones or tablets. The experimental protocol was approved by the University‚Äôs Human Subjects Committee and all subjects gave their written consent prior to their participation in the study.  2.2.  Experimental design  Before evaluating the various keyboards, the chair and work surface was adjusted to match each subject‚Äôs anthropometry in accordance with ANSI/HFES standards (2007). In addition, subjects were allowed to familiarize themselves with the typing software used in the experiment (Mavis Beacon Teaches Typing Platinum e 25th Anniversary Edition; Broderbund Software Inc.; Eugene, OR, USA) using a non-test virtual keyboard. Twelve randomly-selected chapters from a Grimm‚Äôs Fairy Tales were used as the text for the typing. This text had a Flesch-Kincaid grade level of 5.1e5.7 indi- cating the text would easily be understandable by an average twelve year old. In the repeated-measures laboratory experiment, participants typed for two Ô¨Åve-minute sessions on each of the three keyboards used in the experiment. As shown in Fig. 1, two conventional key- boards were tested: a desktop keyboard with 4.0 mm of key travel (DT528AT; Hewlett Packard Inc.; Houston, TX, USA) and a notebook computer with a keyboard with 2.0 mm of key travel (Envy; Hewlett Packard Inc.; Houston, TX, USA); along with a notebook computer with a touch screen interface with 0 mm of key travel  (Iconia; Acer Inc.; Taiwan). The force-displacement characteristics of the two conventional keyboards are shown in Fig. 1. The key spacing (center-to-center distance) was approximately 19 mm on all the keyboards and all conformed ANSI (ANSI/HFES 100, 2007) and ISO standards (ISO9241-410, 2008). During the typing sessions, typing accuracy and adjusted typing speed (the product of gross typing speed and accuracy) were recorded by the typing software program. The order of the key- boards used was randomized and counterbalanced to minimize any potential confounding due to keyboard testing order. The various sections of the text used for the typing tasks were also randomized and counterbalanced. Finally, between the use of each keyboard, a 5-min break was provided to reduce any residual fatigue effects of the previous condition. The duration of the typing task was deter- mined based on previous studies that evaluated typing exposures on various keyboards (Gerard et al., 1999; Gerard et al., 2002; Pereira et al., 2013a).  2.3.  Typing forces  During keyboard use, typing forces were measured using a force platform (Fig. 2). The force platform consisted of a 36 cm  18 cm  0.64 cm (14.17 in  7.09 in  0.25 in) aluminum plate mounted to six degree of freedom force/torque load cell (Mini40E; ATI Inc.; Apex, NC, USA) which allowed detection of forces in three dimensions (Kim and Johnson, 2012). A previous study validated the accuracy of the force platform and showed the absolute mean force measurement errors over a 0e4 N range were less than 10% over the full area of the force platform (Kim and Johnson, 2012). The devices were placed on the force platform such that the ‚ÄúH‚Äù key of each keyboard was positioned in the center of the force platform. Only the downward, z-axis (i.e. perpendicular to the face of the keyboard being tested) were analyzed. To create a Ô¨Çat, continuous work surface, a polyoxymethylene frame which matched the height of the force platform was constructed to sur- round the force plate. Subjects were also instructed to type without resting their hands or wrists on either the device being tested or the force platform since these resting forces would artiÔ¨Åcially increase the measured typing forces. The experimenter observed the sub- jects to ensure they did not rest their hands and wrists on the devices or force platform when typing. Subsequent analysis of the typing force data (forces returning to near zero Newtons between keystrokes) veriÔ¨Åed that subject did not rest their hand on the device and/or force platform. A LabVIEW program (Version 2009; National Instruments; Austin, TX, USA) was used to record force data at a rate of 500 Hz (Kim and Johnson, 2012). Prior to each typing task, the force plat- form was zeroed to offset the weight of the device being tested. The program also simultaneously recorded the digital signals from the keyboard. These digital signals were used by a subsequent LabVIEW-based typing force analysis program to identify individual keystroke force proÔ¨Åles. Only keystroke force proÔ¨Åles associated with the alphanumeric and punctuation portions of the keyboard were evaluated; keystrokes associated with Caps Lock Shift, Ctrl, Alt and Windows keys were not evaluated. The typing force program categorized typing forces as individual keystrokes when the force proÔ¨Åle identiÔ¨Åed by the keyboard digital signal rose above, peaked and then descended below 0.4 N; the force proÔ¨Åle had to be be- tween 16 and 250 ms (ms) long, and the peak force had to occur in the Ô¨Årst half of the force proÔ¨Åle (Rempel et al., 1994). An upper limit of 250 ms was used for keystroke duration, as key rollover (where the letter is repeatedly typed when the key is held down) occurs at durations greater than 250 ms. Over the entire duration of each typing session, median (50th percentile) and peak (90th percentile) typing forces were calculated. In addition, from the individual  Please cite this article in press as: Kim, J.H., et al., Differences in typing forces, muscle activity, comfort, and typing performance among virtual, notebook, and desktop keyboards, Applied Ergonomics (2014), http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2014.04.001

The solid dots and dashed lines indicate the activation forces (make point) and the travel distances, respectively.  keystroke proÔ¨Åles, mean and peak forces, and keystroke duration were calculated.  2.4. Muscle activity  Muscle activity was recorded from the right extensor digitorum communis (EDC), right Ô¨Çexor digitorum superÔ¨Åcialis (FDS), and right trapezius (TRAP) muscle (Fig. 2). The EDC was identiÔ¨Åed by palpating the muscle on the dorsal side of the forearm one third of the way up the forearm and having the subject wiggle their Ô¨Ångers. The electrodes were located where the muscle contractions could be felt (Basmajian and De Luca, 1985; Perotto and Delagi, 1994). Similarly, the FDS was located by touching the muscle on the palmar side one third of the way up the forearm and locating the electrodes where the muscle contractions could be felt (Basmajian and De Luca, 1985; Perotto and Delagi, 1994). The ground electrodes for EDC and FDS muscle were placed on the lateral and medial epicondyles, respectively. The active electrodes for the TRAP muscle were placed 2 cm lateral to the halfway point between C7 and the right acromium process while the ground was placed on C7 (Jensen et al., 1993). Prior to applying EMG electrodes to the skin, the electrode contact area was prepared by shaving hair with a razor (Medline; Mundelein, IL, USA) and cleaning skin surface with Alcohol Prep  Pads (Dynarex; Orangeburg, NY, USA) to reduce skin impedance. Then, disposable Ag/AgCl surface electrodes with an 8-mm diam- eter pick up area (Blue Sensor N-00-S; Ambu; Ballerup, Denmark) were placed with a 20-mm inter-electrode spacing over the three muscles. EMG signals were recorded using a digital data logger (Mega ME6000; Mega Electronics; Kupio, Finland) at a sample rate of 1000 Hz. After collecting the raw EMG data, a band pass Ô¨Ålter of 10e 350 Hz was applied. The Ô¨Åltered EMG data from the EDC, FDS, and TRAP muscles were normalized relative to Maximum Voluntary Contractions (%MVC) and the 10th (static), 50th (me- dian) and 90th (peak) muscle activities were calculated (Jonsson, 1982). To obtain the MVCs, subjects were instructed to extend their wrists and Ô¨Ångers up against isometric resistance (EDC) and to Ô¨Çex their Ô¨Ångers down against isometric resistance (FDS) with verbal encouragement. To obtain TRAP MVCs, isometric resis- tance was applied as subjects performed a continuous single shoulder shrug with their arms at their sides and without bending or twisting at the hips/waist (HarmsRingdahl et al., 1996; Schuldt and Harmsringdahl, 1988). Each contraction time lasted for three to Ô¨Åve seconds (Soderberg and Knutson, 2000). Three MVCs were collected from which the maximum RMS signal over a 1 s period was identiÔ¨Åed and used to normalize the EMG data.

Self-reported comfort and preference  After typing on each keyboard, self-reported comfort and pref- erence ratings were collected using a slightly modiÔ¨Åed Likert scale questionnaire adapted from the ISO keyboard comfort question- naire (ISO9241-410, 2008). The ISO keyboard comfort questionnaire measures self-reported comfort on variable aspects including up- per extremity comfort, usability and productivity with a 7-point scale (1 being least comfortable and 7 being most comfortable). Verbal anchors were used at both ends of each scale.  2.6. Data analysis  The statistical analysis was conducted in JMP (Version 9; SAS Institute Inc.; Cary, SC, USA).  A mixed model with restricted maximum likelihood estimation (REML) was used to test our hy-  potheses that there were differences between a virtual and con- ventional keyboards in terms of typing forces, muscle activity, and typing performance. Any statistical signiÔ¨Åcance was followed-up with a TukeyeKramer post-hoc test to determine whether there were signiÔ¨Åcant differences between keyboards. Friedman tests with post-hoc multiple comparison in R (R 2.13.2, Development Core Team) were used to determine whether there were any dif- ferences between keyboards in self-reported comfort, typing per- formance, and preference. All data are presented as mean and standard error; and signiÔ¨Åcance was noted when Type I error was  less than 0.05 and probabilities less than 0.10 were used to indicate trends that approached signiÔ¨Åcance.  3. Result  3.1.  Typing performance  Compared to conventional keyboards, adjusted (net) typing speed on the virtual keyboard was approximately 60% slower (p < 0.0001) while there was no difference between notebook and desktop keyboards (Fig. 3). Subjects typed with 95% accuracy on the notebook and desktop keyboards whereas accuracy was signiÔ¨Å- cantly lower on the virtual keyboards averaging 84% (p < 0.0001).  3.2.  Typing forces  When median (50th %tile) and peak (90th %tile) typing forces were calculated from the complete ten minute time series of the force data, there were signiÔ¨Åcant differences between the key- boards (Fig. 4). The median typing force on the virtual keyboard was signiÔ¨Åcantly lower (p < 0.0001) while no differences were found between the notebook and desktop keyboards (p ¬º 0.96). The peak typing forces were signiÔ¨Åcantly different across all the keyboards and the virtual keyboard had a lower peak typing force compared to the other keyboards (p < 0.0001); the peak force on the desktop keyboard was higher than the notebook keyboard (p ¬º 0.02).

Asterisks denote statistical signiÔ¨Åcance at a ¬º 0.05 [n ¬º 19]. The error bars represent standard errors.  From the individual keystroke force proÔ¨Åles, mean and peak keystroke forces, and keystroke durations were calculated. The mean keystroke force on the virtual keyboard was lower than the other keyboards (p < 0.0001) while the desktop keyboard had a greater mean keystroke forces (p ¬º 0.02) when compared to the notebook keyboard (Fig. 4). Peak keystroke forces were lowest on the virtual keyboard and highest on the desktop keyboard (p < 0.0001). Based on the keystroke durations calculated of the individual keystroke proÔ¨Åles, the virtual keyboard had shorter keystroke durations compared to the other keyboards (p < 0.0001) while no differences in keystroke duration were found between the notebook and desktop keyboards (p ¬º 0.94).  3.3. Muscle activity  Due to technical difÔ¨Åculties, one of the participant‚Äôs EMG data was not recorded; therefore, the EMG results are based on 18 subjects.  3.3.1.  Finger extensor  The results indicated that there were differences in extensor digitorum communis (EDC) muscle activity between keyboards (Fig. 5). The desktop keyboard showed consistently higher EDC activities for 10th, 50th and 90th percentile muscle activity, compared to the other keyboards.

The results showed a trend (p‚Äôs < 0.10) for FDS muscle activity increasing with key travel distances.  3.3.3.  Trapezius  The results showed that the virtual keyboard had the highest trapezius muscle activity compared to the other keyboards (Fig. 5). The virtual keyboard had higher static muscle activity (10th percentile) when compared to the notebook keyboard (p ¬º 0.007) whereas there were no muscle activity differences between the notebook and desktop keyboards.  3.4.  Self-reported comfort and preference  Self-reported comfort, productivity and preference ratings showed that the virtual keyboard consistently received the lowest (least preferable) ratings in all three categories whereas there were no differences between the notebook and desktop keyboards (Table 1). The notebook keyboard received the highest comfort rating on the arm and shoulder while the desktop keyboard had the highest productivity and ease of use ratings including typing ac- curacy, typing speed, and time needed to adapt to using the keyboard (p‚Äôs < 0.0001).

Discussion  As the use of virtual keyboard is becoming more prevalent, it is important to understand the effects that these keyboards have on a user‚Äôs physical exposures, comfort, and typing performance. Therefore, the present study evaluated whether there were differ- ences between a virtual keyboard, a short travel notebook keyboard, and a long travel desktop keyboard in terms of typing forces, muscle activity, productivity, and user preferences. This study found that, relative to the notebook and desktop keyboards, the virtual keyboard had lower Ô¨Ånger Ô¨Çexor/extensor muscle ac- tivity, but this came at the expense of typing productivity and decreased self-reported comfort in the upper extremities. The results showed that the 50th and 90th percentile typing forces as well as the mean and peak keystroke forces were signiÔ¨Åcantly lower on the virtual keyboard compared to the other keyboards. Previous studies showed that typing forces can be affected by typing speed (Sommerich et al., 1996b) and key- board‚Äôs physical characteristics including key activation force and travel distances (Armstrong et al., 1994; Lee et al., 2009; Radwin and Jeng, 1997; Radwin and Ruffalo, 1999; Rempel et al., 1999). Sommerich et al. (1996b) showed the relationship between typing speed and typing force in a certain condition; however, they did not Ô¨Ånd any relationships between typing speed and typing force when subjects typed at their preferred speed. As the present study allowed subjects to type at their preferred speed, typing force was more likely affected by key activation force than the typing speed. Typing forces have been shown to be positively correlated with key activation forces (Armstrong et al., 1994; Lee et al., 2009; Radwin and Jeng, 1997; Radwin and Ruffalo, 1999; Rempel et al., 1999); that is, higher activation forces can lead to higher typing forces applied to a keyboard. The activation forces of the notebook and desktop keyboards were the same and approximately 0.6 N (Fig. 1). However, the virtual keyboard had no force threshold for key activation as the virtual keyboard had capacitive key sensors which allow key activation with a minimal physical contact. This substantial difference in activation force was likely the reason for the differences between the virtual and conventional keyboards in typing forces. Interestingly, although the notebook and desktop keyboard had similar activation forces, the 4-mm desktop keyboard showed higher mean and peak keystroke forces as compared to the 1.8-mm notebook keyboard (Fig. 4). Previous studies have shown that typing forces are affected by keys stiffness (slope of force- displacement curves) and key travel distances (Gerard et al., 1999; Martin et al., 1996; Radwin and Ruffalo, 1999; Rempel et al., 1997; Rempel et al., 1999). Therefore, the differences in mean and peak keystroke forces between the notebook and desktop keyboard may have been the result of the substantial differences in the force- displacement curves between the keyboards. This reinforces the importance of considering other force-displacement characteristics such as key travel in addition to key activation force when a keyboard is designed. The EMG results indicated that the desktop keyboard had consistently higher mean and peak muscle activity in the Ô¨Ånger extensor (EDC) and Ô¨Çexor (FDS) muscles than the virtual keyboard, and that the notebook keyboard‚Äôs muscle activity tended to be intermediate (Fig. 5). In addition, the virtual keyboard had consistently lower Ô¨Ånger Ô¨Çexor and extensor muscle activity compared to the conventional keyboards although some of  differences were not signiÔ¨Åcant. This was corroborated by the typing forces, in that the virtual keyboard had lower typing forces than the conventional keyboards (Fig. 4). However, as Gerard et al. (1994) found that typing speed affected muscle activity, typing speed may also have contributed to the lower Ô¨Ånger Ô¨Çexor/ extensor muscle activity since subjects typed 60% slower with the virtual keyboard. As a result, the direct comparison of static (10th percentile) and median (50th percentile) muscle activity between the keyboards may be problematic due to the different typing speeds. Different from EDC and FDS muscle activity, TRAP muscle ac- tivity on the virtual keyboard was marginally higher than the other keyboards, especially for static (10th %tile) TRAP muscle activity (Fig. 5). Although the differences were relatively small (w1% MVC), these small exposure differences could be important when they accumulate over time (Pereira et al., 2013b). A previous study (Shin and Zhu, 2011) has shown that TRAP muscle activity was higher during the virtual keyboard use, this was thought to be a result of participants not being able to rest either their Ô¨Ångers or hands during typing so as to avoid accidental key activation. Because a function of the TRAP muscle is to support the arms, Ô¨Çoating the hands and forearms while typing on the virtual keyboard may have increased the static loading in the TRAP muscle and consequently resulted in higher muscle activity. The prolonged static muscle loading is a risk factor for musculoskeletal disorders (Chang et al., 2007; Ijmker et al., 2007; Jensen et al., 2002); thus, using a vir- tual keyboard for long periods of time may increase the risk for musculoskeletal discomfort and/or disorders in the shoulder. However, given the small differences (w1% MVC) in TRAP muscle activities between keyboards and the study condition where sub- jects were directed to Ô¨Çoat their forearms and wrists, further clar- iÔ¨Åcation should be made in future studies to draw conclusive information. Although virtual keyboard resulted in lower typing force and Ô¨Ånger muscle (EDC and FDS) activity than other conventional keyboards, the virtual keyboard‚Äôs self-reported comfort ratings in the hand and wrist were less favorable compared to the other keyboards. Typing forces and muscle activity are known to be directly associated with key activation forces (Armstrong et al., 1994; Lee et al., 2009; Radwin and Jeng, 1997; Radwin and Ruffalo, 1999; Rempel et al., 1999). The negligible force needed to activate the capacitive interface of the virtual keyboard may have resulted in lower typing forces. The lower typing forces with slower typing speed on the virtual keyboard may have also contributed to the lower muscle activity. However, the virtual keyboard‚Äôs lower force and muscle activity did not result in more favorable self- reported comfort ratings in the hand and wrist; this is likely due to the complex interaction between the subjective perception of comfort registered by the central nervous system and the physical comfort registered by the peripheral nervous system. Previous studies (Greening and Lynn, 1998; Valencia, 1986) have shown that the subjective sense of physical loading is not necessarily syn- chronized with the corresponding direct biomechanical measurement. Self-reported measures of typing productivity were consistent with the corresponding objective measures. The subjective typing speed and accuracy on the virtual keyboard was lowest while the conventional keyboards had substantially higher typing speed and accuracy (Table 1). Some of the keyboard-based differences in the typing productivity may be due to subjects‚Äô lack of familiarity with the virtual keyboard. Although the subjects reported that they regularly used virtual keyboards, since conventional keyboards have been in existence longer and are predominantly used when working with computers, they were more likely more familiar with the conventional keyboards. Given the completely different  Please cite this article in press as: Kim, J.H., et al., Differences in typing forces, muscle activity, comfort, and typing performance among virtual, notebook, and desktop keyboards, Applied Ergonomics (2014), http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2014.04.001

In addition, the slower typing on the virtual keyboard was likely the result of subjects having to look at the virtual keyboard keys while typing. Finally, the present study has a few limitations. Although the study found that the virtual keyboard had lower muscle activity on the Ô¨Ånger Ô¨Çexor/extensor muscles than the other conventional keyboards, typing speed may have contributed to the lower Ô¨Ånger muscle activity since subjects typed 60% slower with the virtual keyboard. Due to the typing speed differences between devices, it may be beneÔ¨Åcial to have a condition where typing speed is Ô¨Åxed to the lowest common denominator typing speed (typing speed on the slowest keyboard). Controlling the typing speed can minimize any biases in the EMG data due to typing productivity differences. Furthermore, subjects were instructed not to rest their Ô¨Ångers on devices during typing since these resting forces would artiÔ¨Åcially increase the measured typing forces; consequently, muscle activity measured on Ô¨Ånger extensor and shoulder muscles may have been overestimated since user‚Äôs can usually rest their hands on the de- vice itself or work surface. Nonetheless, because this study compared muscle activity under identical conditions across all the keyboards, the results should provide meaningful comparison of muscle activity across devices. Lastly, median typing force and keystroke durations on the virtual keyboard (Fig. 4) may have been underestimated. One challenge with the virtual keyboard on the notebook computer we tested was that the notebook screen wobbled slightly while subjects typed on the virtual keyboard and this added some noise (i.e. oscillations) to the force data. These force oscillations may have caused an underestimation in the virtual keyboard‚Äôs keystroke duration and median typing forces. In future studies, adding weight to the underside of the notebook computers can move the notebook computer‚Äôs center of mass away from the screen area, increase the resonant frequency of the keyboard, reduce force oscillations, and improve the quality of the typing force data. In conclusion, the study demonstrated that there were differ- ences between conventional keyboards and a virtual keyboard in typing forces, muscle activity, productivity, and preference. The lower typing forces and muscle activity in the Ô¨Ånger Ô¨Çexor and extensor muscles may imply that using a virtual keyboard may be less detrimental in terms of physical exposures. However, the lower typing forces and Ô¨Ånger muscle activity came at the expense of a 60% reduction in typing productivity, and increased self-reported discomfort. Due to the dual vision demands of the notebook com- puter with the virtual keyboard (viewing the text on the vertical screen and having to also look at the keys on the horizontal virtual keyboard), the typing speed on the virtual keyboard tested in this study is likely slower than on tablets where the display and virtual keyboard are on one screen. Given the increased self-reported discomfort and the substantial reduction in typing productivity while typing on the virtual keyboard, when engaging in long typing sessions or when typing productivity is at a premium, conventional keyboards may be more suitable; however, for shorter typing ses- sions when typing productivity is not at a premium, the virtual keyboard is a suitable interface.

s0003687014000441,"  Mobile police ofÔ¨Åcers incur not only acute stressors during emergency response situations, but also cumulative physical de- mands for many of their daily driving and computer-based tasks. These cumulative demands require a combination of static and twisted postures (McKinnon et al., 2011; Brown et al., 2003) and exposure to long-term whole body vibration, a risk factor for back and neck pain (Magnusson et al., 1996). Consequently, mobile po- lice ofÔ¨Åcers have a higher incidence of work absenteeism compared to their colleagues in other departments (Gyi and Porter, 1998; Ovall, 1995). The prevalence of musculoskeletal disorders in law enforcement may be partly attributable to increases in the amount of occupational driving, the rise in administrative tasks completed in the police cruiser, and the non-neutral static postures associated with these tasks (Gyi and Porter, 1998; McKinnon et al., 2011). Since the introduction of in-vehicle laptop computer systems, also called mobile data terminals (MDTs), in police vehicles, many ofÔ¨Åcers have been encouraged to complete nearly all their daily tasks within the cab of the police vehicle in an effort to increase the visual presence of law enforcement in the community.

Although advances in mobile police technology have improved capabilities and efÔ¨Åciency of in-vehicle data acquisition tasks (Agrawal et al., 2003; Hampton and Langham, 2005), the physical risks of injury associated with this modern technology, particularly the mobile data terminal, have not been extensively quantiÔ¨Åed or explored (Agrawal et al., 2003; McKinnon et al., 2011). The physical outcomes associated with the increased work time and tasks per- formed in a mobile police environment have been probed (Brown et al., 2003; Agrawal et al., 2003), but the mechanisms for these outcomes require further investigation. Recent and current in- vestigations have just begun to outline the potential issues with modern in-vehicle technology, and have identiÔ¨Åed MDT use as potential cause of musculoskeletal pain (Brown et al., 2003; Gyi and Porter, 1998; McKinnon et al., 2011; Gruevski et al., 2013) and as a prominent candidate for ergonomic intervention (McKinnon et al., 2011; Gruevski et al., 2013). Data entry tasks have been noted to account for nearly 35% of in-vehicle activity time, and discomfort surveys (police ofÔ¨Åcers) have indicated a deÔ¨Ånite need to quantify physical and psychophysical concerns with MDT use in both the current conÔ¨Åguration and with modiÔ¨Åcation to the MDT location and/or adjustability (McKinnon et al., 2011).

2  C.D. McKinnon et al.  / Applied Ergonomics xxx (2014) 1e8  The primary risks of injury from MDT use are to the shoulder and back. MDT tasks require prolonged reaching and twisting (McKinnon et al., 2011), and such prolonged non-neutral upper extremity postures are indicated as musculoskeletal disorder risk factors (Sommerich et al., 1993). These injury risks are tied directly to the location of the MDT within the police vehicle, and could potentially be reduced with an alternative MDT location. Conventional computing and ergonomics guidelines have placed the keyboard directly in front of the user to maintain neutral shoulder, elbow, and wrist postures. While placing the MDT directly in front of the user would expectedly produce similar positive outcomes and limit the noted non-neutral postures, MDT location under the current cruiser design paradigm is severely inhibited by environmental constraints such as the center console, steering wheel, and, most notably the factor examined in the cur- rent study, the presence of a rear restraint cage. Removing the restraint cage directly behind the driver is a po- tential layout solution that would have three primary beneÔ¨Åts: 1) it would permit greater seat fore-aft and tilt adjustability, which is essential to achieve the ideal 100 seat back angle and ability for any given driver to reach the pedals (Harrison et al., 2000), 2) it would eliminate the position constraints of the MDT in relation to the steering wheel, and 3) it would eliminate reach and trunk rotation required for MDT use by allowing seat and MDT alignment. The latter beneÔ¨Åt is of particular interest in the current study, as more neutral whole body postures associated with seat and MDT alignment could potentially reduce risk of low back and shoulder injury to the mobile police ofÔ¨Åcers. This restraint cage design change may be achieved through a single prisoner transport system. Such systems include a single seat in the rear of the vehicle, and an open compartment directly behind the driver seat. These systems are employed in some Ô¨Çeets and are a commercially available option that also has the beneÔ¨Åts of greater prisoner restraint and additional storage capacity for police equip- ment behind the ofÔ¨Åcer. The Ford Crown Victoria Police Interceptor is the most common North American police vehicle platform, rep- resenting over 75% of the market (Anonymous, 2008). Thus, this study focuses on layout and design solutions speciÔ¨Åc to this vehicle. The purpose of this investigation was to quantify the inÔ¨Çuence of a police cruiser compartment conÔ¨Åguration for a Crown Victoria police vehicle, speciÔ¨Åcally investigating the inÔ¨Çuence a combina- tion of increased posterior seat translation and an MDT location in front of the user have on upper extremity posture, user discomfort and muscle activation while typing compared to the currently used seat position and lateral MDT location.  2.

s0003687014000453,"  Ergonomics and occupational health and safety researchers have demonstrated the importance of designing jobs within the physiological capacity of the workforce (Dempsey et al., 2008). Studies have shown that designing jobs based on the balance be- tween this capacity and the energetic demands of physical jobs is key to maintaining workforce safety and productivity (Malchaire et al., 1984; Abdelhamid, 1999; Wu and Wang, 2002; Dempsey et al., 2008). Oxygen consumption (VO2) reÔ¨Çects energy expendi- ture (EE) associated with physically demanding jobs (Malchaire et al., 1984; Smolander et al., 2008; Wu and Wang, 2002; Bouchard and Trudeau, 2008). Since direct measurement of VO2 requires sophisticated and costly devices, is invasive and often not practical in actual work environments, attempts have been made to Ô¨Ånd alternative feasible estimation methods (e.g., ISO-8996, 2004; Smolander et al., 2008). Many researchers have reported a linear relationship between oxygen consumption and heart rate for a  * Corresponding author. Department of Kinesiology, University Waterloo, ON, Canada N2L 3G1.

Hence, determining an individual‚Äôs VO2eHR relationship (calibra- tion curve) has become a very common practice to assess VO2 from HR data (Smolander et al., 2008). This calibration process involves measuring an individual‚Äôs HR and VO2 while performing a graded exercise, such as treadmill, stationary bicycle or step-test. The linear relationship between the two variables is then modelled using graphical or linear regression analysis. The model is then used to estimate VO2 from HR data collected in the Ô¨Åeld for the same individual. One major criticism of this method is the difÔ¨Åculty of estab- lishing individual calibration curves at workplaces with large working populations. Even though the calibration procedure is simple, it is time consuming (at least 45 min per individual), re- quires a trained practitioner, and requires access to a controlled environment. Another criticism is the fact that at low activity levels (low workload intensity), the relationship between HR and VO2 is nonlinear and often deviates from the calibration curve and thus may produce inaccurate estimates of VO2 (Abdelhamid, 1999; Bouchard and Trudeau, 2008; Smolander et al., 2008). In recent years, a number of artiÔ¨Åcial intelligence (AI) techniques have been proposed as alternatives to conventional statistical methods  Please cite this article in press as: Kolus, A., et al., Estimating oxygen consumption from heart rate using adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system and analytical approaches, Applied Ergonomics (2014), http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2014.04.003  
2  A . Kolus et al.  / Applied Ergonomics xxx (2014) 1e9  (Jang et al., 1997; Kaya et al., 2003; Yildirim and Bayramoglu, 2006). One of the most effective AI techniques, particularly for function approximation and pattern recognition, is the adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS). It combines the unique ability of fuzzy logic to make decisions in uncertain conditions with the learning and adaptive capabilities of artiÔ¨Åcial neural networks (Kaya et al., 2003). ANFIS has consistently been demonstrated effective in solving nonlinear function approximation problems, particularly in biomedical engineering (G√ºler and √úbeyli, 2004, 2005; √úbeyli and G√ºler, 2005a,b). The primary objective of the present study is to develop a fuzzy- based general model for VO2 estimation from HR that does not require individual calibration and hence can be used quickly and easily by practitioners in actual workplaces. The secondary objec- tive is to develop individualized models based on fuzzy logic and analytical methods that provide higher accuracy VO2 estimates for laboratory and small population work environments applications. The proposed models are expected to improve handling of the nonlinearity and uncertainty involved in VO2 estimation. Heart rate and VO2 measurements performed in a laboratory environment and in the Ô¨Åeld were used to develop and test the proposed models. Their performance was compared with traditional individual methods, namely linear calibration (Schulz et al., 1989; Bouchard and Trudeau, 2008) and Flex-HR (Spurr et al., 1988; Ceesay et al., 1989) methods.  2.

s0003687014000465,"  To reduce the discomfort arising from vibration, vehicle seats can be designed to minimise the transmission of vibration. The optimisation of the vibration transmissibility of a seat requires understanding of how vibration discomfort can be predicted from the vibration experienced at the seat surfaces. The dynamic properties of a seat (e.g., damping and stiffness) are inÔ¨Çuenced by the physical properties of foam or other material (e.g., density, thickness, Ô¨Årmness) that might be engineered to achieve the desired seating comfort including vibration isolation. The most common method of quantifying the dynamic properties of a seat is the seat transmissibility. This shows how the ratio of vibration measured at the subjecteseat interface to the vibration in the same direction on the Ô¨Çoor varies according to the frequency of  * Corresponding author.

The vertical transmissibility from the Ô¨Çoor beneath the seat to the surface on the seat squab beneath the ischial tu- berosities of a person is most often measured, but non-vertical transmissibility, and the transmissibility to other locations, espe- cially the backrest, are also studied. Unless a seat is entirely rigid, the transmissibility invariably shows that vibration is ampliÔ¨Åed at some frequencies (i.e., at the resonance frequency) and attenuated at other frequencies. There may be a vertical resonance of a seat squab around 4 Hz (e.g., Corbridge et al., 1989) and fore-and-aft resonance through a seat backrest around 5 Hz (Qiu and GrifÔ¨Ån, 2003). However, the transmissibility of a seat is not sufÔ¨Åcient to predict vibration discomfort. Discomfort can arise from multiple- input vibration (at a seat squab, at a backrest, and at the feet) and the motion can be complex (e.g., multiple-axis and multiple- frequency or random). The contribution of each input to vibration discomfort must be understood if the transmissibility of a seat is to be optimised (GrifÔ¨Ån, 2007). The optimisation of the vibration transmissibility of a seat should not be conÔ¨Åned to minimising the ampliÔ¨Åcation that  Please cite this article in press as: Basri, B., GrifÔ¨Ån, M.J., The application of SEAT values for predicting how compliant seats with backrests inÔ¨Çuence vibration discomfort, Applied Ergonomics (2014), http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2014.04.004

The optimisation must include consideration of all frequencies of vibration that occur on the Ô¨Çoor supporting the seat, the extent to which these are transmitted through the seat, and the extent to which they in- Ô¨Çuence comfort, or some other human response (e.g., interfer- ence with activities or health). The Seat Effective Amplitude Transmissibility (i.e., SEAT value) was introduced to combine these three functions of frequency in a single value indicating the extent to which a seat improves or degrades vibration discomfort (GrifÔ¨Ån, 1978, 1990). The SEAT value may be considered the ratio of the vibration discomfort experienced when sitting on a seat to the vibration discomfort that would be experienced when sitting on a rigid seat (or sitting on the Ô¨Çoor). A value greater than 100% (or 1.0) indicates how much the vibration discomfort is increased by the seat. Ideally, seats have SEAT values less than 100%, but this is not always the case. The calculation of a SEAT value re- quires understanding of how vibration discomfort depends on the frequency of vibration. Originally, this was achieved using the frequency-dependence of the reduced-comfort boundary in the Ô¨Årst version of ISO 2631 (1974), but the frequency weightings in later standards are now used (i.e., BS 6841, 1987, ISO 2631-1, 1997). The SEAT concept has been adopted in various standards for quantifying the efÔ¨Åciency of seats in isolating vertical vibra- tion (e.g., ISO 10326-1, 1992, ISO 7096, 2000). Although the SEAT value is most usually applied to quantify the vertical isolation efÔ¨Åciency of the seat squab (or seat suspension), it can be used for other directions of vibration. For example, it can be used to quantify the efÔ¨Åciency of a seat in isolating the transmission of fore-and-aft vibration to the backrest (GrifÔ¨Ån, 1990). More generally, a SEAT value can be used to quantify the overall isolation efÔ¨Åciency of seat by a single value, taking into account multi-axis vibration transmitted to both the seat squab and the backrest. The concept behind the SEAT value is intuitively obvious: it uses a method of predicting vibration discomfort to compare the vibration discomfort when sitting in a seat to the vibration discomfort that will be experienced when sitting in a reference seat (i.e., a rigid seat). Nevertheless, there are assumptions that are not entirely obvious. For example, the method will not pro- vide a good estimate of the isolation efÔ¨Åciency of a seat if the weightings for the frequency of vibration or the direction of vi- bration do not accurately reÔ¨Çect how vibration discomfort varies with the frequency or direction of vibration. There will also be errors if the method of combining the vibration experienced in different directions, or at different locations, or in different postures (e.g., due to inclined backrests) is not appropriate. Although the SEAT value is widely used, there has been little investigation of how well it predicts the inÔ¨Çuence of realistic seats on vibration discomfort. With solely vertical vibration (often the dominant direction in transport), the vibration isolation efÔ¨Åciency of a seat can be pre- dicted from a SEAT value calculated from vertical vibration at the seat pan (using frequency weighting Wb from BS 6841:1987 or frequency weighting Wk from ISO 2631-1 (1997)) and vibration at the backrest (using frequency weightings Wc and Wd) (GrifÔ¨Ån, 2007). However, seats usually have inclined backrests and it has been reported that the Wc weighting overestimates the discomfort caused by x-axis vibration of inclined backrests at low frequencies and underestimates at frequencies greater than 8 Hz (Kato and Hanai, 1998; Basri and GrifÔ¨Ån, 2011). Furthermore, with increasing inclination of a backrest there is greater support for the upper-body and the relative importance of vertical seat pan vi- bration is reduced (Basri and GrifÔ¨Ån, 2012, 2013). It is not known how well a SEAT value based on currently standardised weightings will predict the overall vibration discomfort when sitting in a compliant seat with an inclined backrest.  The experiment reported here was designed to investigate how the compliance of seats with inclined backrests inÔ¨Çuence vibration discomfort. The effect of seat compliance on SEAT values (calcu- lated from evaluations of vibration at the seat, the back, and the feet) was compared with the effect of seat compliance on judge- ments of vibration discomfort.  2. Method  2.1. Apparatus  A rigid seat frame was constructed from aluminium extrusions with a Ô¨Çat horizontal wooden seat pan (500  440 mm), Ô¨Çat wooden backrest (400  630 mm) inclined 30 from the vertical, and a Ô¨Çat wooden footrest (500  340 mm) inclined 60 from the vertical (Fig. 1). The dimensions of the seat were designed to pro- vide a comfortable sitting posture for a 50th percentile British male aged 19e45 years (Pheasant, 1990). Four seating conditions were tested: three compliant seats and the rigid seat. The compliant seats consisted of two rectangular polyurethane blocks placed on the horizontal surface of the rigid seat and secured to the inclined backrest. Three different blocks of foam on the seat pan are designated as: C1 (1.8 kg, 500  500  120 mm), C2 (1.4 kg, 485  485  95 mm), and C3 (1.2 kg, 455  405  105 mm). The block of foam secured to the backrest is designated as B1 (1.0 kg, 380  610  70 mm). The foams for the seat pan were chosen primarily for their differences in apparent stiffness: C3 was the hardest and C1 was slightly softer than C2. The surface of the rigid seat pan and backrest were covered with 1-mm thick neoprene rubber to provide friction with the body. There was no headrest. A rigid footrest was used in all conditions. The height of the footrest was adjusted to provide similar thigh contact in all con- dition (with the upper surface of the upper legs approximately horizontal). A loose lap belt was provided for safety but did not restrain subjects during vibration. The seat was securely mounted to the platform of a hydraulic vibrator capable of 1-m peak-to-peak displacement in the vertical direction.  2.2.  Signal generation and acquisition  The acceleration of the vibrator platform was monitored using single-axis piezo-resistive accelerometers (Entran Model EGCSY-240D-10) attached on the platform. The acceleration of the inclined backrest was measured in the x-axis and the z-axis (i.e., at 30 to the horizontal and 30 of the subject to the ver- tical, respectively), using similar accelerometers. The accelera- tions at the interfaces between the body and the foam were monitored using two tri-axial SIT-pads conforming to ISO 10326-1 (1992). The SIT-pad at the seat pan was positioned 180 mm forward from the centre to the rear edge of foam on the seat pan so subjects could sit with the SIT-pad beneath their ischial tuberosities. The SIT-pad at the backrest was nominally positioned 550 mm from the centre to the top edge of the backrest foam. The position of this SIT-pad was adjusted ac- cording to the height of subjects so that it was in contact with the upper back (around the upper thoracic region between C7 and T3). Vibration stimuli were generated and sampled using HVLab Signal Processing Toolbox in Matlab (version R2010) and output via a digital-to-analogue converter (NI 6211) at 512 samples per sec- ond. Signals from the accelerometers were low-pass Ô¨Åltered at 50 Hz and then sampled at 512 samples per second.

Procedure  The experiment was conducted in four sessions corresponding to four seating conditions (i.e., the rigid seat and the three compliant seats, C1, C2, and C3). Each subject completed all four sessions within two days, with two sessions per day. Each session lasted less than 40 min. The order of sessions was balanced across subjects.

Subjects used the method of magnitude estimation to judge the discomfort produced by test stimuli relative to the discomfort produced by a reference stimulus.

They then practiced judging the discomfort caused by vibrations before commencing the experiment on their Ô¨Årst day. Subjects were able to ask for stimuli to be repeated if they were unsure of their judgement.  Subjects were required to close their eyes during the presenta- tion of the stimuli they were judging so as to avoid seeing the motion of the vibrator and their motion relative to the laboratory. They wore headphones presenting a masking white noise at 65 dB(A). The experimenter and the subjects were provided with separate emergency stop buttons.

Equivalent comfort contours within seating condition: Part 1  In Part 1 of the study, subjects sat in each of the four seating conditions and used the method of magnitude estimation to judge the discomfort produced by 56 test stimuli from an array of 14 frequencies (from 1 to 20 Hz in one-third octave intervals) at four  2 r.m.s.). vibration magnitudes (0.2, 0.4, 0.8 and 1.6 ms In this part of the study, subjects sat on the seat pan with backrest contact (i.e., back leaning comfortably against the back- rest) with their hands resting on their laps. There was no support for the head: to control the posture of the head, subjects were requested to look straight ahead as when driving. Subjects were presented with a reference stimulus followed by a test stimulus and asked to estimate the magnitude of vibration discomfort, j, produced by the test stimulus (of acceleration magnitude, 4) assuming the reference stimulus (8 Hz at 0.4 ms r.m.s.) produced a vibration discomfort of 100.

There were two conditions: (i) subjects sat upright without backrest contact during the presentation of reference and test stimuli, and (ii) subjects sat upright without backrest contact during the presentation of the reference stimulus  and then leant back so that they were sitting with backrest contact (as in Part 1) during the presentation test stimuli. The stimuli were presented when subjects had adjusted to the required posture and were ready. In both conditions, subjects estimated the magnitude of their vibration discomfort, j, produced by each test stimulus (of acceler- ation magnitude, 4) assuming the reference stimulus (8 Hz at 0.4 ms r.m.s.) produced a vibration discomfort of 100. In both conditions, there were four pairs of stimuli (i.e., reference-test separated by a 2-s pause), presented in different randomised order to each subject.

The z-axis trans- missibility of the backrest was calculated from accelerometers at the same locations but inclined 30 to the vertical.  2.4.  Subjects  Using a within-subject experimental design, 12 healthy male subjects participated in all four sessions (i.e., with the four seating conditions). Subjects had a mean age of 26 years (SD: 2.2), a mean stature of 1.76 m (SD: 8.8), and a mean weight of 73.7 kg (SD: 14.9). Subjects were students and staff of the University of Southampton with no history of any serious illness, injury, or disability that might affect their judgement of vibration. The experiment was approved by the Human Experimentation Safety Ethics Committee of the Institute of Sound and Vibration Research at the University of Southampton. All subjects gave their voluntary consent prior to the start of their Ô¨Årst session on each day.  3. Results  3.1.  Subjective measurement  3.1.1.  Rates of growth of discomfort, n  For each frequency of vibration, the magnitude estimates of vibration discomfort, j, and the vibration magnitudes, 4, are assumed to be related by a power law (Stevens, 1975):  j ¬º k4n  2  Individual values for the rate of growth of discomfort, n, and the constant, k, were determined from the slopes and intercepts of linear least squares regressions between log10j and log104 at each frequency:  log10j ¬º n log104 √æ log10 k  3  In each of the four seating conditions, the rate of growth of discomfort, n, was strongly dependent on the frequency of vibra- tion (p < 0.001, Friedman; Fig. 2). The rate of growth of discomfort only differed between seating conditions at 4 and 5 Hz (p < 0.001, Friedman). Six pairwise com- parisons performed between the four seating conditions with an adjusted signiÔ¨Åcant level (p ¬º 0.05/6 ¬º 0.008), showed the rates of growth of discomfort differed between the foam seats and the rigid seat: between the hard foam seat (C3) and the rigid seat at 4 and 5 Hz, between the softer foam seats (C1 and C2) and the rigid seat at 4, 5 and 6.3 Hz (p < 0.008, Wilcoxon).  3.1.2.  Equivalent comfort contours within seating conditions  Individual equivalent comfort contours were calculated at four sensation magnitudes (j ¬º 80, 100, 125 and 160, relative to 100  2 r.m.s. at 8 Hz) using Equation (2) and individual n with 0.40 ms and k values at each frequency (Table 1). Median equivalent com- fort contours were constructed from the medians of the 12 indi- vidual equivalent comfort contours at each of these four sensation magnitudes (Fig. 3). As expected from the dependence of the rate of growth of discomfort, n, on the frequency of vibration and the seating con- ditions, the shapes of the equivalent comfort contours varied with the magnitude of vibration and the seating condition.   2  Fig. 4. Relative discomfort between seating conditions: (a) contours indicate the median vibration acceleration at the vibrator platform required to produce discomfort equivalent to 0.4 ms r.m.s. of 8-Hz vertical vibration at vibrator platform when sitting upright on a rigid seat with no backrest contact; (b) contours indicate the ratio of vibration acceleration at the vibrator platform with each foam seat to that with the  2 r.m.s. of 8-Hz vertical rigid seat required to cause discomfort equivalent to 0.4 ms vibration with the rigid seat.  The transmissibility, H(f), of each of the three compliant seats was calculated from the ratio of the cross-spectral density of the input and output acceleration, Sxy(f), to the power spectral density of the input acceleration, Sxx(f), with a frequency resolution of 0.25 Hz:  H√∞f √û ¬º Sxy√∞f √û Sxx√∞f √û  1  The vertical transmissibility of the seat cushion was calculated from the input acceleration measured by an accelerometer on the vibrator platform and the output acceleration measured by an accelerometer in a SIT-pad on the seat cushion beneath the ischial tuberosities.

This was achieved by two adjust- ments to the equivalent comfort contours obtained within each seating condition. The equivalent comfort contour for each subject was Ô¨Årst rescaled to the sensation magnitude of the ‚Äòcommon reference within each seating condition‚Äô, using individual n and k values for the respective seating conditions as determined in Part 1 of the study. The rescaled equivalent comfort contours were then rescaled again to the sensation magnitude of the ‚Äòcommon refer- ence between seating conditions‚Äô, using individual values of n with the rigid seat as determined in Part 2 of the study e assuming the same vibration acceleration at the interface between the body and a seat will produce similar vibration discomfort with a rigid seat and a compliant seat squab. The medians of these twelve individual ‚Äòrescaled‚Äô equivalent comfort contours were determined for each seating condition to yield the r.m.s. acceleration of the vibrator platform required with each seating condition at each frequency to cause similar discomfort to that caused by the ‚Äòcommon reference between seating conditions‚Äô (Fig. 4a).

Location of discomfort  With all frequencies and magnitudes of vibration and all seating conditions, subjects generally felt discomfort in their backs, shoulders, buttocks, or thighs: the body parts with greatest weight supported by the seat pan and the backrest (Fig. 5). However, the number of subjects reporting discomfort in either their head or neck varied with frequency when sitting in the compliant seats with the greatest magnitudes of vibration, and when sitting in the rigid seat with the middle magnitudes of vibration (p < 0.01, Cochran‚Äôs Q). The number of subjects reporting discomfort in either their head or neck varied between seats at 10, 12.5, 16, and 20 Hz when exposed to the greatest vibration magnitudes, and at 20 Hz when exposed to the middle magnitude (p < 0.01, Cochran‚Äôs Q). With the greatest vibration magnitude, the number of subjects reporting discomfort in either their head or neck differed between the rigid seat and each compliant seat (p < 0.05, McNemar). More subjects reported discomfort in either their head or neck when sitting in the rigid seat but in either their lower legs or feet when sitting in the compliant seats.  3.1.5. Measured discomfort  To quantify the effect of the different types of foam on vibration discomfort at each frequency, the ratios of the vibration accelera- tion required with each compliant seat, …ëcompliant, to the accelera- tion required with a rigid seat, …ërigid, to cause similar discomfort to the ‚Äòcommon reference between seating conditions‚Äô (determined from Part 2 of the study, see Section 3.1.3) were calculated at each frequency (Fig. 4b):  Ratio of accelerations √∞%√û ¬º acompliant  arigid   100%  4  To compare the measured and predicted seating discomfort, these acceleration ratios were inverted to have a similar meaning to a SEAT value, and are referred to as the ‚Äòmeasured seat dynamic discomfort‚Äô, MSDD, in this paper:  Measured seat dynamic discomfort; MSDD √∞%√û  ¬º  1  Ratio of accelerations  5  A measured seat dynamic discomfort, MSDD, of 100% would imply similar discomfort as when sitting on the rigid seat. Per- centages lower or higher than 100% indicate less or more discom- fort than with the rigid seat, respectively. The seat foam had a large effect on vibration discomfort. The MSDD differed between seating conditions at frequencies from 6.3 to 20 Hz (p < 0.001, Friedman: Fig. 6). The MSDD with seats C1 and C2 was less than with the rigid seat at all frequencies from 6.3 to 20 Hz (p < 0.008, Wilcoxon). The MSDD of seat C3 was greater than that of the rigid seat at 4 Hz and 5 Hz (p < 0.008, Wilcoxon) but less than the rigid seat at all frequencies from 8 to 16 Hz (p < 0.008, Wilcoxon). There were no differences in the MSDD between seats C1 and C2 at any frequency (p > 0.05, Wilcoxon). However, the MSDD of seat C1 was less than that of seat C3 at all frequencies greater than 6.3 Hz, and the MSDD of seat C2 was less than that of seat C3 at all frequencies between 5 and 20 Hz (p < 0.008, Wilcoxon).  3.2.

The median resonance frequencies were 3.5, 3.75, and 4.25 Hz with C1, C2 and C3 respectively (Table 2). The transmissibility at resonance also differed between the foams (p < 0.001, Friedman), with the difference between C3 and the other two compliant seats (p < 0.05, Wilcoxon). The median ampliÔ¨Åcation at resonance was 20e23% greater with C1 and C2 than with C3 (Table 2). With seat C3, there was a secondary resonance around 7e8 Hz, and a median transmissibility consistently greater than the other two compliant seats at all frequencies greater than the resonance frequency (Fig. 7a). The backrest condition did not signiÔ¨Åcantly affect the resonance frequency or the transmissibility at resonance in any of the compliant seats (p > 0.05; Friedman; Fig. 8). However, compared to sitting upright with no backrest, the transmissibility was reduced when sitting with the back in contact with the backrest at fre- quencies between 0.75 and 3.5 Hz with all three seats (p < 0.05,  Table 2 Median primary resonance frequency and transmissibility at resonance for Ô¨Çoor to seat, Ô¨Çoor to x-back, and Ô¨Çoor to z-back for seats C1, C2, and C3.

With seat C3, when sitting with the back in contact with the backrest the transmissibility was increased at frequencies between 5 and 8.5 Hz and reduced at frequencies between 11.25 and 20 Hz (p < 0.05, Wilcoxon). Floor to x-back transmissibility differed between the three foam seats at some frequencies, but the trend was similar with the me- dian transmissibility exhibiting two peaks: a primary peak around 4 Hz and a secondary peak in the range 6e8 Hz (Fig. 7b). The me- dian x-back transmissibility of seat C3 was consistently higher at frequencies around resonances, and lower at frequencies greater than about 11 Hz than with the other compliant seats (Fig. 7b): the transmissibility was greater for seat C3 than seat C1 at frequencies between 7 and 9 Hz, and greater than seat C2 at 7.75 Hz (p < 0.017, Wilcoxon, adjusted signiÔ¨Åcance, p ¬º 0.05/3 ¬º 0.017). However, the transmissibility of seat C3 was only signiÔ¨Åcantly less than that of seat C2 at frequencies between 11 and 13.75 Hz (p < 0.017, Wilcoxon). The trends in the Ô¨Çoor to z-back transmissibility were similar with all seats: a slight resonance around 4 Hz, slight attenuation between 6 and 10 Hz, and ampliÔ¨Åcation at frequencies greater than about 10 Hz (Fig. 7c).

In the present study, the subjects were exposed to si- nusoidal vertical vibration at each frequency and so the SEAT value was calculated for each frequency so that it could be compared with subject judgements of vibration discomfort at that frequency. A SEAT value is often calculated for only one part of a seat (e.g., the seat squab) and only one direction of vibration (e.g., vertical). The discomfort of subjects in this study may have been affected by vibration at other locations (i.e., at the seat back and the feet). Although the input vibration was vertical, there was both vertical and fore-and-aft vibration at the backrest. The SEAT value was therefore calculated from ‚Äòoverall ride values‚Äô so as to reÔ¨Çect the differences in vibration at the seat, the back, and the feet between the compliant seat and the rigid seat when sitting with backrest contact. The overall ride values were calculated according to BS 6841 (1987) from the square-root of the sums-of-squares (r.s.s.) of the frequency-weighted root-mean-square accelerations at the seat, the back, and the feet (Table 3):    3.2.2.

The SEAT values (i.e., the predicted discomfort) were dependent on seating condition at all frequencies (p < 0.02, Friedman: Fig. 10). The SEAT values for each of the compliant seats differed from those for the rigid seat at all frequencies except at a cross-over frequency (p < 0.008, Wilcoxon). With seats C1 and C2 the SEAT values were greater than with the rigid seat at all frequencies less than 6.3 Hz but less than with the rigid seat at higher frequencies. With seat C3 the SEAT values were greater than with the rigid seat at all fre- quencies less than 8 Hz but less than with the rigid seat at all fre- quencies greater than 10 Hz. There were no signiÔ¨Åcant differences in the SEAT values between C1 and C2 seat at any frequency except 2.5 Hz and 10 Hz (p < 0.05, Wilcoxon). There were signiÔ¨Åcant dif- ferences between these two compliant seats and seat C3, with the SEAT values of seats C1 and C2 greater at all frequencies less than 4 Hz but less at all frequencies greater than 6.3 Hz (p < 0.008, Wilcoxon).  3.3. Measured and predicted seating discomfort  For each of the three compliant seats, the measured seat dy- namic discomfort (i.e., MSDD) was broadly similar to the predicted seat discomfort (i.e., SEAT value), but there were signiÔ¨Åcant dif- ferences (Fig. 11). With seat C1, the SEAT prediction overestimated discomfort at 1.25 and 3.15 Hz and at all frequencies greater than 5 Hz, except 16 Hz (p < 0.05, Wilcoxon, Fig. 11a). With seat C2, the prediction signiÔ¨Åcantly overestimated discomfort at all frequencies except 1.6, 2.5, 4 and 5 Hz (p < 0.05, Wilcoxon, Fig. 11b). With seat C3, the prediction signiÔ¨Åcantly overestimated discomfort at fre- quencies between 6.3 and 16 Hz (p < 0.05, Wilcoxon, Fig. 11c).  Fig. 7.

This was due to the resonance of the human-seat system when sitting on the foam: the Ô¨Çoor-to-seat vertical transmissibility (Fig. 7a) and the Ô¨Çoor-to- back x-axis transmissibility (Fig. 7b) were greatest around 3.5e 4.5 Hz (Table 2). AmpliÔ¨Åcation of vibration at the seat surface also produced movement in shear between the back and the backrest, as seen by comparing z-axis Ô¨Çoor-to-seat and Ô¨Çoor-to-back trans- missibilities (Fig. 7a and c), causing discomfort in the lower back and the upper back (Fig. 5). In all three foam seats, the least measured discomfort occurred at frequencies greater than 10 Hz (Fig. 6). At these frequencies, for similar discomfort when sitting on the rigid seat about 80% less vibration was required at the Ô¨Çoor than when sitting on seats C1 and C2, and 50% less vibration was required than when sitting on seat C3. The combined dynamic properties of the human body and the foams resulted in vibration isolation at frequencies greater than about 6 Hz with seats C1 and C2 and at frequencies greater than about 8 Hz with seat C3 (Fig. 7a, Table 2). The isolation provided by seat C3 was less than provided by the other two compliant seats: the vibration at the seat surface was 25% or more with seat C3 than with seats C1 and C2 at all frequencies greater than 8 Hz (Fig. 7a). This will have contributed to the greater discomfort experienced with seat C3 than with seats C1 and C2 at these frequencies.  Fig. 8.

B. Basri, M.J. GrifÔ¨Ån / Applied Ergonomics xxx (2014) 1e14  11  can be seen that contact with the backrest tended to increase the vibration transmitted through the seat cushion at frequencies be- tween about 4 and 9 Hz, consistent with Corbridge et al. (1989). In part, this might arise because movement of the upper-body induced by the backrest is transmitted to the lower-body and the seat surface, consistent with a resonance of the upper-body be- tween 4 and 8 Hz in the x-axis of the back (Fig. 7b). Contact with a backrest may also change the dynamic response of the body (e.g., the vertical apparent mass measured at the seat) and the combined dynamic response of the seat-body system (Toward and GrifÔ¨Ån, 2009).  4.3.  The efÔ¨Åciency of  the SEAT prediction model  The usefulness of SEAT values can be examined by comparing them with the measured discomfort at each frequency. The con- tributions to the overall ride value from each component ride value (i.e., the weighted acceleration at the seat, the back, and the feet) were calculated for the three compliant seats and the rigid seat so as to examine possible reasons for differences between the SEAT values and the measured discomfort (Fig. 12). The SEAT values were greater than the measured discomfort at low frequencies (i.e., 1.25e3.15 Hz) with seats C1 and C2, and at high frequencies (i.e., at frequencies greater than about 6.3 Hz) with all three compliant seats. The differences may be understood by simpliÔ¨Åcations in the standardised method of predicting discom- fort (i.e., assuming the weightings are unaffected by the inclination of the backrest and assuming that relative motion between the seat and the feet does not contribute to discomfort; Jang and GrifÔ¨Ån, 2000). With a single frequency of excitation and a single point of contact with vibration on a seat, the SEAT value is the same as the seat transmissibility. The same frequency weighting is applied to the vibration on the seat and the vibration entering the seat. With multiple-frequency vibration, the SEAT value is comprised of more than one frequency component and the frequency weighting in- Ô¨Çuences the overall SEAT value. With multiple-input vibration, the SEAT value is comprised of more than one input and the relative weighting of each input inÔ¨Çuences the overall SEAT value. In the present case, with single-frequency vibration transmitted to the seat, the back, and the feet, if the ratios of the weightings between these inputs are incorrect, the overall SEAT value will also be incorrect. However, the direction of the error in the SEAT value will depend on whether the magnitude of vibration at any point is greater than, or less than, with a rigid seat. If the vibration trans- mitted to any location is greater than with a rigid seat (i.e., the  Fig. 10. Median SEAT values for each seat (%) indicating the ratio of the likely discomfort with each seat to that of with the rigid seat at each frequency (100% in- dicates the likely discomfort is similar to that with the rigid seat; percentages higher or lower than 100% predict more or less vibration discomfort than with the rigid seat).  High frequencies of vibration tend to cause discomfort at lo- cations in the body close to the source of vibration (Whitham and GrifÔ¨Ån, 1978). The greater sensitivity to vertical vibration at the seat and to vertical vibration at the backrest than to vertical vi- bration at the feet (GrifÔ¨Ån et al., 1982) is consistent with more subjects reporting discomfort in the buttocks, thighs, lower back or upper back with the rigid seat than with the three compliant seats. The foam reduced high frequency vibration at the seat and the backrest by more than 50% (Fig. 7a and b), leaving vibration at the feet a more dominant source of discomfort and more subjects reporting discomfort in either their feet of lower legs at high frequencies with the compliant seats than with the rigid seat (Fig. 5).  4.2.

12  B. Basri, M.J. GrifÔ¨Ån / Applied Ergonomics xxx (2014) 1e14  transmissibility is greater than 1.0), the SEAT value will be over- estimated if the weighting is too great. If the vibration trans- mitted to any location is less than with a rigid seat (i.e., the trans- missibility is less than 1.0), the SEAT value will be under-estimated if the weighting is too great. In the present study, the greatest errors in SEAT values will therefore tend to occur at the frequencies where foam increased the transmission of vibration to the body (e.g., around 5 Hz) or where the foam decreased the transmission of vibration to the body (e.g., from 8 to 20 Hz).  4.3.1. Effect of backrest inclination on the frequency weighting for vertical seat vibration  At 3.15 Hz there was no signiÔ¨Åcant difference in the measured discomfort between the three compliant seats (see Section 3.1.3, Fig. 4a). However, the discomfort predicted by the SEAT values was greater than the measured discomfort with seats C1 and C2 but not with seat C3 (Fig. 11). At 3.15 Hz, the Ô¨Çoor-to-seat transmissibilities of seats C2 and C3 were greater than that of seat C3 (Fig. 7a). Ver- tical vibration at the seat (i.e., the z-seat component ride value in  Fig. 12.

B. Basri, M.J. GrifÔ¨Ån / Applied Ergonomics xxx (2014) 1e14  13  Fig. 12a and b) was the main contributor to the increased SEAT value for these two seats. With frequencies around 5 Hz, more vertical seat vibration (approximately 50% more) is required to cause discomfort when a backrest is inclined at 30 than with an upright backrest (Basri and GrifÔ¨Ån, 2012). Use of the standardised weighting (i.e., Wb with k ¬º 1.0) to evaluate vertical vibration on the seat squab with inclined backrests in this study would therefore overestimate discomfort, consistent with the SEAT values being greater than the measured discomfort. With greater seat trans- missibility, the overestimate will be greater, as seen with seats C1 and C2.  4.3.2. Effect of backrest inclination on the frequency weighting for x-axis back vibration  The foam ampliÔ¨Åed x-axis vibration at the back between 4 and 8 Hz but attenuated vibration at frequencies greater than about 8 Hz (Fig. 7b). The ampliÔ¨Åcation of x-axis backrest vibration at some frequencies (i.e., <8 Hz; Fig. 7b) may have contributed to increased discomfort in the range 2.5e8 Hz (Fig. 6), although a greater in- Ô¨Çuence over this frequency range was probably the ampliÔ¨Åcation of z-axis vibration transmitted to the seat (Fig. 7a). Around 4e6.3 Hz, the discomfort caused by x-axis vibration of a backrest reduces by 30e40% when a backrest is reclined from 0 (i.e., vertical) to 30 (Basri and GrifÔ¨Ån, 2011). The Wc weighting for x-axis acceleration of the back therefore overestimates discomfort at these frequencies when there is a 30 inclination of a backrest, as in the present study. With greater acceleration on the backrests of the compliant seats than the rigid seat, the use of the Wc weighting will have over-emphasised fore-and-aft backrest vi- bration and contributed to the greater predicted discomfort (i.e., greater SEAT values) than measured discomfort. At frequencies greater than about 6.3 Hz, there was more discomfort from vibration when sitting in the rigid seat than when sitting in any of the three compliant seats. The attenuation of x-axis backrest vibration at frequencies of high sensitivity to x-axis backrest vibration will have reduced discomfort in the compliant seats compared to the rigid seat. Kato and Hanai (1998) reported the discomfort of x-axis vibration of an inclined backrest would be underestimated by 40e50% when using the Wc weighting at fre- quencies greater than 8 Hz. The x-axis vibration at the interface between the back and the backrest was very much less with the three compliant seats than with the rigid seat (the Ô¨Çoor to x-back transmissibility was around 0.5; Fig. 7b). If the x-axis back vibration was given greater weight (as implied by Kato and Hanai, 1998), it would contribute more to the overall ride value, with a greater increase in the rigid seat than in the compliant seats. This would reduce the SEAT values in the compliant seats so that they were more similar to the measured discomfort.  4.3.3. Vibration of  the feet  As the frequency of vibration increased above about 8 Hz, the vibration of the feet became an increasingly important cause of discomfort in the compliant seats, but not the rigid seat (Fig. 5). This is consistent with the dominant contribution to the SEAT values at high frequencies coming from the vibration at the feet when sitting on the compliant seats but not on rigid seat (Fig. 12). The weighted acceleration at the feet changed little over the range 5e20 Hz, but the vibration of the feet became more important as the weighted acceleration from other inputs reduced as the frequency of the vi- bration increased. Similarly, although the acceleration at the feet was the same for the compliant seats and the rigid seat, the vi- bration at the feet was of greater importance in the compliant seats due to the lower magnitudes of vibration at other locations.  4.3.4. Overview  Seat compliance changes the dynamic response of the seat-body system and the discomfort caused by vertical vibration. Resonance of a seat cushion in the region of 4 Hz increases vibration discomfort, whereas attenuation of vibration at higher frequencies decreases vibration discomfort, with the increases and decreases in discomfort dependent on the compliance of the seat cushion. Attenuation of high frequency vibration at the seat and the backrest leaves vibration at the feet a more dominant source of vibration discomfort. Contact with a compliant vibrating backrest produces vibration of the upper-body that is transmitted to the lower-body and the seat squab. Vertical vibration of a compliant seat squab produces vibration of the lower-body that results in shear motion between the back and the backrest. The application of the results of the study should recognise that other factors, including differences between subjects (e.g., gender and the extremes of age and body size) may inÔ¨Çuence the depen- dence of both vibration discomfort and the compliance of the seating on the frequency of vibration and the location of contact with vibration.  5.  Conclusions  Useful predictions of how the compliance of seats with back- rests inÔ¨Çuence the discomfort caused by vertical vibration are provided by SEAT values determined from overall ride values that take into account the discomfort caused by vibration at the seat, the back, the feet, and any other source. Differences in the present study between SEAT values and subjective judgements of discomfort over the range 1.0e20 Hz can be explained by known assumptions and simpliÔ¨Åcations in currently standardised methods of predicting vibration discomfort. The discrepancies are likely to be partially due to the use of fre- quency weightings for vertical (i.e., z-axis) seat vibration and fore- and-aft (i.e., x-axis) back vibration that do not take into account the inÔ¨Çuence of the inclination of the backrest on the frequency- dependence of vibration discomfort at the seat and the backrest.

s0003687014000477,"  It is commonly accepted that the hospital environment affects patients‚Äô experiences when they are admitted and treated in these spaces (see Dijkstra et al., 2006). Research on healthcare design and planning has highlighted strong relationships between environ- mental characteristics and human health (Monti et al., 2012). Sound is one part of the hospital environment. Ergonomics evaluations commonly consider the sound level of spaces, such as ofÔ¨Åces (Passero and Zannin, 2012) and consider the effect of them in reference to guidelines. Many studies have used this approach for hospitals and documented sound level within acute care hospital spaces (Busch-Vishniac et al., 2005; Okcu et al., 2011; Salandina et al., 2011). Sound levels range from 60 to 70 dB(A) with peaks of around 90 dB(A), equivalent to a busy motorway (Joseph and Ulrich, 2007). These exceed recommendations produced by bodies such as the World Health Organisation (Berglund et al., 2000) or the UK Government (Department of Health, 2008) by around 20e30 dB(A). Consideration is needed however, of how sound contributes to the feeling of the hospital space as ‚Äòquietness‚Äô is a quality indicator which is associated with a lack of annoying noises rather than the  * Corresponding author.

Although there can be negative health consequences of excessive sound within these spaces (Ulrich, 1992), there is potential for positive beneÔ¨Åts in un- derstanding and maintaining the soundscape of the ward; for instance hearing the various occupational sounds, such as tea trolleys, as positive sounds (Mackrill et al., 2013a). A soundscape is deÔ¨Åned as the auditory version of a landscape (Schafer, 1976) and considers the complete sound environment rather than focusing on a single source such as the beep of a monitor. As control of hospital sounds should consider positive aspects and move away from sound level measurement (Dawson, 2005) understanding the soundscape offers a new approach, particularly as the sound quality is not simply determined by level but other factors such as physical space (Hignett and Lu, 2010). Investigating the subjective response to the existing soundscape may create a more feasible way of improving the sound of the spaces, particularly as there is a consistent trend of rising levels since the 1960s (Busch-Vishniac et al., 2005). Therefore, a need to evaluate the effectiveness of interventions aiming to improve the subjective response to a hospital ward soundscape has arisen. Although studies have investigated subjective responses to hospital sounds to a certain degree (Topf, 1985; Akansel and Kaymakci, 2008; Xie and Kang, 2010) none have considered how to create a positive soundscape using interventions which may be of practical beneÔ¨Åt.

2  1.1. Aim  J. Mackrill et al.  / Applied Ergonomics xxx (2014) 1e7  The aim of this study was to use laboratory listening evaluations to test interventions which might create a more positive emotional- cognitive response to hearing the soundscape of a cardiothoracic (CT) ward. This evaluated the effect of soundscape interventions to understand which may be considered appropriate for investigation within the ward setting. This was the third stage in a four part research project aiming at understanding and improving the perception of a hospital ward soundscape (Fig. 1). Part 1 aimed to understand the perception of the soundscape and inform the di- rection of subsequent steps. Part 2 created a framework to measure the response to the soundscape with this being used to understand the effect of soundscape interventions in Part 3, presented here. From this theoretical generalisation Part 4 was carried out in-situ to evaluate the chosen intervention.  2.  Soundscape intervention rationale  The following soundscape interventions were used based on the premise that sound level reduction would not necessary create a more positive soundscape. As a result it was hypothesised that the soundscape would elicit more positive responses when each intervention was applied to the existing sound clips of the CT soundscape.  2.1. Natural sound  Natural sound (NS) was selected due to the agreement from literature (Guastavino, 2006; Pheasant et al., 2010; Yang and Kang, 2005a,b) which advocates that natural sounds of birdsong and water are positive soundscape features. Additionally, Mackrill et al. (2013a) found natural sounds to be a positive aspect of the CT ward soundscape when heard through windows overlooking a green space.  2.2.  Steady state sound  Steady state sound (SSS) was chosen as an intervention as masking sounds are a way in which negative sound can be controlled (Bowman, 1974). DeÔ¨Åned as the presence of one sound that renders another sound undetectable (Plack, 2005), this has been tested to improve hospital soundscape perception (see Stanchina et al., 2005). When white noise was added to the sounds of an intensive care unit, despite an increase in sound level, sub- jectively sleep was consolidated and arousal was less frequent (Stanchina et al., 2005). Despite a small sample and a non- signiÔ¨Åcant effect, this shows a change in perception.  Table 1 Sound clips and broad content classiÔ¨Åcation for the 12 soundscape clip stimuli.

Sound source information  Written information detailing the various sound sources of the soundscape was chosen as hospital wards produce a sensory over- load of unfamiliar stimuli which bombard patients with experiences they are unaccustomed to (Akansel and Kaymakci, 2008). Under- standing hospital sounds however, enables patients to habituate and accept sound (Mackrill et al., 2013a). As complex environmental sounds are processed as meaningful events, providing information about interactions with environment (Guastavino et al., 2005), it may be necessary for patients to understand the sounds of the ward in order to feel comfortable within it. Furthermore, Topf (2000) suggests that personal control is the capacity to regulate stress caused by a negative event. This may be a cognitive approach by having information about the stressor (Topf, 2000). As such, it was proposed that providing information detailing what can be heard in the soundscape may improve the feeling that the soundscape elicits. This is called sound source information (SSI).  3. Method  3.1.

J. Mackrill et al.  / Applied Ergonomics xxx (2014) 1e7  3  was chosen to scope the potential of these interventions. This provided the means to facilitate the investigation of the inventions in an easily repeatable and controlled setting. Evaluations were held in a Sound Room laboratory. This con- sisted of a 16 speaker system (using KEF iQ70 and HTS3001SE speakers) operated via a PC computer using Nuendo 4 sound editing software. The system played back hospital soundscape re- cordings through all 16 speakers. Twelve twenty second soundscape excerpts were presented to participants. These were selected from a database of 32 recordings taken within the CT ward using a Bruel and Kjaer binaural SonoScout recording device. The most salient clips were selected for presentation informed by the analysis of all 32 recordings using the coding procedure developed by Poxon et al. (2009) (Table 1). For interventions of NS and SSS, the associated sounds were incorporated into all clips. NS was obtained from the website www. freesoundproject.org [accessed 3rd March 2011] and contained the sound of a blackbird singing and a babbling stream. SSS was ob- tained from using a short one second recording of a steriliser ma- chine sound present within the CT ward providing a steady non- descript sound. The sound level of these interventions was set so they formed a congruent background feature rather than a domi- nant foreground sound. These sounds were only played through the ceiling speakers to help achieve this with the researcher judging the sound level at which they were set. SSI was presented on a response sheet (Table 2). This informa- tion was designed from the sound sources within the 12 sound- scape clips. The information was the same for each soundscape clip rather than specifying details of the individual sources within each of the 12 clips. This was to assess if SSI would work in a generic manner. Further, as the hospital soundscape is constantly varying an in-situ SSI intervention would have to be generic in nature to accommodate the majority of features rather than focusing on speciÔ¨Åc nuances.  3.2.  Experimental procedure  Each soundscape clip lasted around 20 s presented sequentially with a 10 s inter stimulus period to discriminate between clips. Participants completed each of the four conditions on separate occasions. Interventions were applied to the 12 soundscape clips during each condition. Evaluations were conducted a minimum of two day apart to avoid demand effects, however this varied ac- cording to participant availability. To avoid order effects, partici- pants were split into four groups with the condition sequence order randomised using a Latin square counterbalancing method. In addition, each group started the evaluation on a different sound- scape clip, either 1, 2, 3 or 4, to further control for bias. Responses were recorded on a paper questionnaire using four seven point semantic differential scales. These rating scales were derived from the emotional-cognitive dimensions which the au- thors established in study 2 (see Mackrill et al., 2013b). The perceptual dimensions were labelled ‚ÄòRelaxation‚Äô and ‚ÄòInterest and Understanding‚Äô. ‚ÄòRelaxation‚Äô was measured using the bipolar semantic scales ‚Äòrelaxed-stressed‚Äô and ‚Äòcomfortable-uncomfortable‚Äô. ‚ÄòInterest and Understanding‚Äô used the scales ‚Äòcurious-uninterested‚Äô and ‚Äòintrigued-bored‚Äô. At the end of the questionnaire, basic de- mographic questions and open questions were asked to provide descriptive data beyond numerical quantiÔ¨Åcation and included:   Were there any sounds that particularly affected you?  How did you feel overall when listening to the recordings?  How does having information on the soundscape make you feel?  Table 2 SSI as an intervention used to detail the soundscape clip.  What you may hear  Blood pressure monitors beeping for observations.  Nurses talking to patients about how they feel.  Trolleys moving equipment around the ward.  Cleaning machines to keep the ward tidy.  General bustling of the ward, patients going for treatments, phones ringing etc. Sound of trolleys bringing in food.  Patients talking and moving around. Jingling of cups.  Other staff talking.     Associated activities  Patient Observations.  Cleaning.  Bed Changing.  Chatting.  Washing.    Lunch.  3.3. Analysis  The reliability of the scales measuring each dimension was tested across conditions to ensure that the results could be justi- Ô¨Åably compared. This was carried out using a Cronbach‚Äôs a test. The main effect was analysed using a repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) and was performed using statistical software SPSS 19 once the normality of the data had been established.  3.4.  Sample  Sample size was calculated using GPower3 software (Faul et al., 2007). Setting a power level of 0.80 with an effect size (eta2) of 0.25 (small) for a repeated measure ANOVA with four conditions and one group, sample size was calculated to be n ¬º 24 (a level set 0.05 resulting in a test power of 0.81, CI 95%). The 24 participants had a mean age of 32 years (S.D. 10.13 yrs), with 13 male and 11 female. The sample included a range of non-expert demographics from within and outside the University community. Recruitment took place using a convenience sampling strategy. Although a sample demographic was obtained that was removed from those speciÔ¨Åc to the CT ward, the soundscape of a CT ward was chosen due to the variety of sound representative of general hospital spaces. There- fore the sample demographic may experience such soundscapes which supported this strategy. Further this study was used to inform theoretical rather than empirical generalisation: generation of theoretical concepts deemed to be of wider application (Ritchie and Lewis, 2003). The exploration of empirical generalisation was carried out in stage 4 of the research project.  4. Results1  4.1.  Scale reliability  The ‚ÄòRelaxation‚Äô dimension recorded high reliability, Cronbach‚Äôs a ¬º 0.921 across all conditions. Likewise ‚ÄòInterest and Under- standing‚Äô recorded Cronbach‚Äôs a ¬º 0.895, suggesting that the scales were consistent in measuring the emotional-cognitive response and thus allowing a valid comparison between conditions.  4.2.

Pairwise comparisons, with a Bonferroni correction to account for the increase in pairwise comparisons, showed a signiÔ¨Åcant difference between the control and all interventions (Table 3).

Subjective comments  Although the manner of each intervention was not divulged to participants, subjective response to the conditions showed trends in response to positive and negative sounds. Negative sounds included patient and staff conversation, particularly when private. Sounds of monitor alarms were also described as annoying:  Table 3 Difference and change in emotional-cognitive response caused by each condition.   Private conversation between patients and nurses I don‚Äôt feel  The crying lady [sound clip 6, a patient with dementia crying should be listening to these.

It can also be suggested that although a masking beneÔ¨Åt may be had, it possible creates a feeling of tedium reÔ¨Çected in the larger change in ‚ÄòInterest and Understanding‚Äô.

It was hypothesised that the soundscape would elicit more positive responses when each intervention was applied to soundscape clips. This was supported on the ‚ÄòRelaxation‚Äô dimension with a less clear result was apparent on the ‚ÄòInterest and Understanding‚Äô dimension. However, only a small effect size that was reported (partial h2 ¬º 0.05) across the main effect. Encourag- ingly, the scales reported good reliability (Cronbach‚Äôs a ¬º 0.895) across conditions and the measured emotional-cognitive response was reasonably robust. As it is necessary for sound within hospital environments to be considered beyond that of sound level (Blomkvist et al., 2005) discussion can be formed as to the potential of these soundscape interventions at a theoretical level. NS had a signiÔ¨Åcant 10.1% effect on perception of the sound- scape (p ¬º <0.001). This was unsurprising given the comparable Ô¨Åndings urban soundscape work has produced reporting on pref- erence to natural sounds (Guastavino, 2006; Yang and Kang, 2005a,b). Additionally, this was the only intervention to produce a consistent positive effect, shown by positive movement within the perceptual space towards the positive end of the ‚ÄòRelaxation‚Äô axis (see Fig. 2). Tsuchiya et al. (2003), who used especially designed natural sounds played to patients undergoing a general anaesthetic, can be used to support this further. The authors found this had a signiÔ¨Å- cant calming effect and also improved the perceived acceptability of the anaesthesia experience compared to patients experiencing normal sounds. This goes someway to support the use of natural sounds within the hospital environment due to their relaxing beneÔ¨Åt. During stage 1 of this research project, it was found that patients who were located near windows overlooking green space, and could hear birdsong, has a more positive perception of the sound- scape (see Mackrill et al., 2013a). This is not surprising since human interactions with nature have a positive impact on health and wellbeing (Grinde and Patil, 2009). Further to this, NS could be effective in a hospital soundscape as auditory perception is drawn to the sound of temporal variation which lowers the attention to other sounds (De Consel et al., 2011) for example negative beeping or rustling. Caution is needed however. Comments both presented here and in stage 1 of the project show that such sounds could be too much if ‚Äúpiped in‚Äù. Therefore, it remains to be ascertained as to the true effect additional birdsong may have in these settings. Indeed, auditory visual congruence is an important concept for the acceptance of sounds (Pheasant et al., 2010) and so the correct visual surrounding would be needed that may be difÔ¨Åcult to provide. (p ¬º 0.008) on the SSS produced a smaller signiÔ¨Åcant effect ‚ÄòRelaxation‚Äô dimension; a 3.3% change. However, some clips also showed a negative movement on the ‚ÄòRelaxation‚Äô dimension. Limited comments speciÔ¨Åcally mentioning this additional sound suggests that it did not evoke a strong conscious appraisal unlike NS and therefore the beneÔ¨Åt is more questionable. As discussed, Stanchina et al. (2005) found positive effects for a similar inter- vention. In consolidating sleep this may be positive, however, for the ‚Äòday‚Äô environment the sound may be appraised as simply an additional occupational sound rather a sound. This is somewhat reÔ¨Çected in the comments by participants. A participant did comment regarding a perceived level of privacy that the intervention brought. It is difÔ¨Åcult to draw conclusions from this as it should be noted that improvements in patient privacy come from factors including and beyond sound. For example, van de Glind et al. (2007) report patients perceived signiÔ¨Åcantly less auditory and visual privacy in treatment areas with curtains, compared with a room with solid walls. As a result SSS may be complex to intro- duce into the soundscape.  positive  Reuter (2011) reported on a case study within a medical ofÔ¨Åce building where due to the close proximity of workstations, waiting and checkout areas verbal privacy was poor. However, when considering masking to improve the situation the level required to achieve this would be detrimental to user comfort. Therefore, SSS  might be perceived negatively: ‚ÄúI can imagine after an hour like this I may be extremely bored which is bad (P8).  affect  feeling  ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt  The most novel intervention was SSI. SSI was used to act as in- formation about the stressor (Topf, 2000), the soundscape, with the view that this would aid understanding and thus a more positive response. Emotional focused coping (Folkman and Lazarus, 1988) like this can help generate a reappraisal of a person-environment encounter to be more positive. This intervention proved to have a signiÔ¨Åcant overall effect on the ‚ÄòRelaxation‚Äô element of the sound- scape and caused a 4.7% positive change in perception. Considering this, some participants suggested they did not sense the beneÔ¨Åt of having information: (P24)‚Äù. The effect of SSI may not be obvious to the individual as it is not perceptually tangible, unlike an additional sound, but may actually inÔ¨Çuence response nevertheless. The non-signiÔ¨Åcant effect seen on the ‚ÄòInterest and Understanding‚Äô dimension was unex- pected as it was thought that SSI would facilitate understanding based on the initial rationale for the intervention. Nonetheless, this provides an interesting concept to explore as patient naturally experience a certain degree of habituation to hospital sounds when exposed over longer periods as discussed in Mackrill et al. (2013a). Therefore, SSI provides an opportunity to positively inÔ¨Çuence the perception of sound in hospital environments because mental processes such as previous knowledge greatly impact auditory perception (Snyder et al., 2012). As such SSI may offer potential to paediatric patients to become familiar and comfortable with the soundscape of their hospital surroundings. Simply explaining the origin, occurrence, and ways to mitigate certain everyday sounds could reduce the frustration they cause children (Dellve et al., 2013). SSI requires a comprehensive assessment within the ward space as perception will be inÔ¨Çuenced during exposure to the context of the hospital ward environment the mediating factors of the soundscape (e.g. physical factors, patient interaction, behaviour) (Mackrill et al., 2013a). More development is now needed and has been initially explored as a direct result of the presented experi- mental Ô¨Åndings (see Mackrill et al., 2013c) showing supportive results.  5.1.  Limitations  Perhaps the greatest limitation was that the sample selected was not representative of a patient demographic within a CT ward e normally elderly patients. Using healthcare spaces for such work does present pragmatic problems in terms of installing equipment and impacting upon the daily duties within these spaces. Further to this, it can be difÔ¨Åcult to recruit participants along with ethical questions raised about exposing patients to experimental in- terventions such as these that have not had a degree of testing. As a result, members of the public were recruited for the presented study. Being a patient in hospital is a stressful experience, coupled with medication and pain. These are factors that may inÔ¨Çuence the subjective appraisal of the ward soundscape. As the listening evaluation participants were healthy this mediating factor cannot be accounted for in the results. As a consequence, the Ô¨Åndings might not be truly representative. However, from a philosophical view, everyone has the chance to become a patient so individuals‚Äô views on the soundscape are important. Indeed the UK Department of Health (2009) comment when promoting patient and public  Please cite this article in press as: Mackrill, J., et al., Exploring positive hospital ward soundscape interventions, Applied Ergonomics (2014), http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2014.04.005

Despite the fact the size and direction of effects from healthcare environment alterations is highly dependent on the patient popu- lation (Dijkstra et al., 2006) this does not stop such work being of value and contributing to the Ô¨Åeld in an effort to create positive hospital environments. Capturing the emotional-cognitive response on semantic scales poses problems. Questions can be raised as to how individuals govern their judgements about soundscape perception and how these can be measured when individual differences vary so greatly (Hall et al., 2011). Here this may be more apparent when trying to quantify a complex psychological process such as an emotional- cognitive response and relate it to theory. As a result the use of statistics is arguably questionable for inferring effects. Neverthe- less, the method provides a barometer as to positive changes to the soundscape which could be developed in practice. Visual cues were not provided to ensure that responses were made solely to the soundscape clips. One participant commented that visual recognition of the sounds would inÔ¨Çuence feeling. Indeed, this may be the case as context is important in soundscape perception (Brown et al., 2011) and as such this is acknowledged as a limitation. Music has been advocated to create healing spaces within hos- pitals (Dijkstra et al., 2006). For example, Thorgaard et al. (2005) performed a multicentre study in Ô¨Åve post anaesthesia care units in Denmark. The questionnaire study investigated patient (n ¬º 325) and staff (n ¬º 91) opinion of a specially designed music environ- ment through ceiling mounted speakers. Eighty three per cent of patients found the environment pleasant or very pleasing, 6% un- pleasant and 11% had no opinion. However, musical tastes differ among patients, staff, and elderly patients along with sounds such as the radio (Liu and Tan, 2000; Mackrill et al., 2013a). Due to this subjectivity music was not considered here.  5.2.  Future work  As sound is somewhat ‚Äòintangible‚Äô in comparison to say colour or physical shape, it is possible it can be overlooked in the design of hospital spaces, certainly in the sense of ‚Äòdesigning‚Äô sound for the user. The authors suggest that a more formal evaluation of the soundscape within a hospital ward should now be considered utilising the measurement scales here and appraising the inÔ¨Çuence of the mediating factors of the soundscape. This would allow a systems type (Wilson, 2013) appraisal looking at how a soundscape intervention interacts with staff and patients, their subjective re- sponses, sound levels, broader environmental characteristics and work practices. It is only when individuals are exposed to the whole ‚Äòintegrated‚Äô environment (Parsons, 2000) with all elements (sound, light, temperature etc.) interacting that an environment can be adequately appraised. The authors have begun to explore this (see, Mackrill et al., 2013c) by testing SSI in-situ within a CT ward to start to a certain the empirical generalisation (Ritchie and Lewis, 2003) of the research. Building upon this, research now needs to fully investigate if SSI is a positive addition to the hospital environment: improving the experience of the hospital soundscape for patients. Furthermore, understanding which patient groups (e.g. paediatrics, geriatrics) may beneÔ¨Åt most from such an intervention should also be considered.  6.  Conclusions  It was found that natural sound and written sound source in- formation were the most effective intervention at altering the  emotional-cognitive response to individuals hearing soundscape clips of a CT ward. Potentially, these interventions could improve the perception of the soundscape and the feeling of being in the hospital space. It is SSI that offers an interesting and simple way to enable individuals to potentially understand the soundscape of a hospital ward. Future work can now be done to look at this in-situ to assess if this simple intervention can be of beneÔ¨Åt to patients within hospital environments. It is hoped that the discussion here may bring the concept of the soundscape to the ergonomics arena, which may be integrated into holistic environmental evaluations.

Increased cardiovascular strain result- ing from hyperthermia reduces maximal cardiac output (Cheuvront et al., 2010; Gonzalez-Alonso et al., 2008; Hargreaves, 2008), mean arterial pressure (Gonzalez-Alonso and Calbet, 2003; Hargreaves, 2008), oxygen delivery (Fink et al., 1975; Gonzalez-Alonso et al., 2008), overall oxygen uptake (Cheuvront et al., 2010; Fink et al., 1975; Gonzalez-Alonso and Calbet, 2003; Periard et al., 2011) and central neuromuscular drive (Cheung and Sleivert, 2004). There- fore, optimizing tolerance in the heat through attenuating heat stress by balancing metabolic heat gain with heat loss becomes a central focus in maintaining performance and safety (Cheuvront et al., 2010). One distinct method utilized in an attempt to miti- gate heat stress and improve heat tolerance is the employment of clothing with properties that positively augment heat dissipation  * Corresponding author.

The design and fabric are principal factors that inÔ¨Çuence a gar- ment‚Äôs insulation and air permeability properties, which subse- quently affect heat transfer (Woodcock, 1962). The use of clothing provides a layer of insulation and a barrier between the skin and the environment (Gavin, 2003). Wool and cotton garments have high sorption properties, causing the fabric to hold sweat, which may lead to decreased comfort and impaired heat dissipation as a result of decreased evaporation of sweat (Dai et al., 2008). Conversely, synthetic polyester garments have been suggested to improve sweat evaporation, due to increased fabric permeability, possibly leading to a lower core temperature (Gavin et al., 2001; Woodcock, 1962).

However, whether these synthetic polyester garments have a signiÔ¨Åcant effect on the physiological and perceptual responses during exercise in the heat still remains unclear and current research has demonstrated inconclusive evidence. A study by Gavin et al. (2001) revealed no alterations in physi- ological or perceptual responses during exercise of eight highly trained athletes in a warm environment with clothing conditions consisting of a short sleeved cotton and synthetic polyester shirt.

As a result, the exercise intensity and duration may have failed to adequately stress the participants‚Äô thermoregulatory systems, negating any impact of clothing. In a follow-up study utilizing similar environmental and clothing con- ditions, Brazaitis et al. (2010) found that higher exercise intensities revealed better sweat evaporation and reduced sweat sorption in participants wearing the polyester garments. However, no differ- ences in the two garments for any thermo-physiological or sub- jective comfort responses were observed. While Gavin et al. (2001) reported that their study may have been limited by an exercise intensity and duration that was too low in relation to the training level of their participants, Brazaitis et al. (2010) did not measure the aerobic capacity of their participants. This would make it difÔ¨Åcult to assess whether the assigned absolute workload was an intense level of physical activity for all eight participants. Therefore the absolute treadmill workload of 5 mph at 1% grade may have fell short of their desired intensity range. Even with each participant performing three 20-min bouts of exercise with Ô¨Åve minutes of rest, the physiological stress of the exercise intensity would be different for each participant and highly dependent on their aerobic capacity. This would make it prob- lematic to elucidate clothing‚Äôs impact on thermoregulation at a speciÔ¨Åc intensity of exercise. For this reason, quantifying the stress relative to an individual‚Äôs physiological system would better establish equivalent exercise intensities among participants (McArdle et al., 2007). Therefore, the aim of the present is to investigated the effects that a form Ô¨Åtted, moisture-wicking fabric shirt, promoted to have improved evaporative and ventilation properties, has on the physiological and perceptual responses during moderate intensity exercise in the heat. To the best of our knowledge, no study has explored this in recreationally active participants using a pro- longed, continuous exercise protocol that establishes exercise in- tensity as a percent of their current aerobic capacity.  2. Material and methods  2.1.  Participants  Ten recreationally active male participants (Age: 24.5  3.5 yrs, Height: 179.8  0.1 cm, VO2peak: 42.4  6 mL kg  1 min  1, Body Weight: 90.8  13.1 kg, Body Mass Index: 27.9  3.8 kg m  2, Body Fat: 15.4  6.0%) participated in this study. All participants were healthy, free of disease and medication use, not obese (Body Mass  2), and non-smokers. The study was approved Index < 30.0 kg m by the Human Participants Institutional Review Board at Western Michigan University. All participants read and signed the informed consent prior to participation in the study.  2.2.  Research design  Each participant visited the human performance research lab- oratory on three separate occasions. During the Ô¨Årst visit, anthro- pometric measurements were obtained and each participant performed a maximal graded exercise test on a cycle ergometer. On the second and third visits, a heat stress test was performed. One heat stress test was conducted with the participant wearing a non- form Ô¨Åtted, 100% cotton, short sleeved t-shirt (COT) and the other heat stress test was conducted with the participant wearing a short sleeved, form Ô¨Åtted, commercially available, synthetic shirt (81% polyester and 19% elastane) (SYN). The SYN shirt was promoted by the manufacturer to be moisture wicking and have enhanced air permeability due to a ventilated mesh back. The COT and SYN shirts were Ô¨Åtted to cover the same skin surface area and each participant  wore the same athletic shoes, ankle socks and knee length shorts (top of the patella) during both heat stress tests. The order of the heat stress tests was counter-balanced and each participant Ô¨Ånished the study in a four week time period. Prior to each visit, participants were instructed to refrain from alcohol, caffeine, and physical activity the day before and the day of the visits to the laboratory.  2.2.1. Anthropometric assessment and graded exercise test  Upon arrival to the laboratory on the Ô¨Årst day, all research procedures were explained to the participants and informed con- sent was obtained. Each participant then completed a health his- tory questionnaire in order to conÔ¨Årm that they were healthy, free of disease and medication use, and classiÔ¨Åed as ‚Äúlow-risk‚Äù ac- cording to the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) guidelines (2010). Each participant then had their anthropometric measurements assessed. Weight and height were measured via a digital scale (Totalcomp, Fair Lawn, NJ) and stadiometer (Seca Instruments Ltd, Hamburg, Germany), respectively. Skinfold thickness was measured at seven sites (triceps, abdomen, thigh, calf, suprailiac, chest, subscapular) using skinfold calipers (Lange, Beta Technology Inc. Cambridge, MD). Each site was measured three times with the mean of the three measurements used as the skinfold thickness. The Jackson & Pollock 7-site equation was used to calculate body density from the skinfold assessment and the Brozek equation was used to calculate percent body fat from body density (Brozek et al., 1963; Jackson and Pollock, 1985). Upon completion of the anthropometric assessment, the participant completed a graded exercise test on a cycle ergometer (Corival, Lode B.V., Groningen, Netherlands) to determine VO2peak. Prior to all tests, the metabolic cart was calibrated using a 3-L sy- ringe and gases of known concentration. Each participant was then Ô¨Åtted with a nose clip and a mouthpiece for the collection of expired respiratory gases using the metabolic measurement cart (TrueOne 2400, ParvoMedics, Sandy, UT) and a telemetry heart rate (HR) monitor (Polar USA, Lake Success, Long Island, NY). Lastly, each participant was instructed on using the Borg Ratings of Perceived Exertion (RPE) chart (Morgan and Borg, 1976). Once instrumentation of the participant was complete, the ex- ercise test began. The graded exercise test started at 60 Watts for 2 min and then exercise intensity was increased 20 W every minute until volitional fatigue. VO2peak was deÔ¨Åned as the greatest 30-sec average during the test.  2.2.2. Heat stress tests  During the second and third visits to the laboratory, each participant completed a heat stress test (COT or SYN). To ensure hydration, each participant was instructed to consume w6e8 mL of water per kilogram of body weight 2 h prior to testing. Upon arrival to the laboratory, each participant was instructed to void and nude body weight was measured. Each participant was then instructed to insert a rectal temperature probe (Physitemp Instruments Inc., Clifton, NJ) 13 cm past the anal sphincter. After insertion of the rectal probe, skin thermocouples (Physitemp In- struments Inc., Clifton, NJ) were attached to the right side of the body at the chest, triceps, thigh and calf with waterproof tape (Hy- tape, Hytape International Inc., Patterson, NY) for determination of mean skin temperature (MTsk) (Ramanathan, 1964). It is important to note that the chest and triceps skin thermocouples were covered by the shirt in both conditions. Rectal and skin thermocouples were interfaced to a data acquisition system (Thermes USB, Physitemp Instruments Inc., Clifton, NJ), which was linked to a PC computer. For the determination of sweat volumes an automated resistance hygrometry system (QSweat, WR Medical Electronics Co.,  Please cite this article in press as: De Sousa, J., et al., The effects of a moisture-wicking fabric shirt on the physiological and perceptual responses during acute exercise in the heat, Applied Ergonomics (2014), http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2014.04.006  
J. De Sousa et al.  / Applied Ergonomics xxx (2014) 1e7  3  Stillwater, MN) was utilized (Bullard, 1962). Ventilated capsules (0.787 sq cm) were secured with rubber straps to the upper chest, back, thigh, and forearm and then interfaced to a PC for the continuous collection of sweat volume. A telemetry HR monitor was strapped around the participant‚Äôs chest for the measurement of HR. Lastly, the participant‚Äôs shirt was weighed (LC101, Omega Engineering Inc., Stamford, CT) and then placed on the individual before they were seated on a lounge chair in a semi-recumbent position. Once instrumentation of the participant was completed, the participant sat quietly for 20 min in a thermo-neutral environment (24  C, 60% RH) (24 CBASE), followed by 30 min of seated rest in a heated environment (33 C, 60% RH) (33CBASE). Rectal tempera- ture (Tre), skin temperatures and sweat rate (SR) were measured continuously. Thermal sensation (Gagge et al., 1967), sweating sensation (Gavin et al., 2001), RPE and HR were assessed during the last minute of 24CBASE and 33 CBASE. After completion of 33CBASE, the participant was transported to the electronically braked cycle ergometer and began the exercise portion of the trial. Exercise consisted of cycling for 45 min at 50% VO2peak in 33 C air and 60% RH (33 CEX). Expired respiratory gases were assessed during 0e15 min, 25e30 min and 40e45 min of exercise. During minutes 5e7 of exercise, if the participant was not within 5% of the desired 50% VO2peak, workload adjustments were made to elicit the desired exercise intensity. This workload was then replicated during the participant‚Äôs second trial. Rectal tem- perature, skin temperatures and SR were measured continuously during exercise. HR, RPE, thermal sensation, and sweat sensation were recorded every 5 min. Water intake was monitored and measured. Each participant was permitted to consume water ad libitum during the Ô¨Årst heat stress test. To control for hydration status between the two heat stress test Ô¨Çuid consumption during session two mimicked the initial heat stress test. At the completion of each heat test, the participant‚Äôs garment was immediately placed in the same freezer bag, sealed and weighed. All probes and capsules were removed and the partici- pant was instructed to towel off and weigh them self nude.  2.3.  Calculations  2.3.1. Mean skin temperature  MTsk was calculated using the weighting formula: MTsk ( C) ¬º (0.28 * Tchest) √æ (0.08 * Ttricep) √æ (0.28 √æ Tthigh) √æ (0.22 * Tcalf) √æ (0.14 * Tforearm) (Toner et al., 1986).  2.3.2.  Sweat volumes, whole body sweat loss and shirt weight  Cumulative sweat volume was calculated as the sum of sweat 24CBASE, 33CBASE and 33 CEX. produced in mL cm2 during Whole body sweat loss was calculated as the difference between pre and post body weight, plus the amount of Ô¨Çuid consumed during the trial. Shirt weight difference was calculated as the dif- ference between shirt weight pre and post exercise.  2.4.  Statistical analysis  To analyze the differences between the COT and SYN apparel shirts for temperature, sweat volume and rate, HR and perceptual data, a two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with repeated measures was utilized. The factors in the analysis were clothing (COT vs. SYN) and time with both being repeated measures. In the case of a signiÔ¨Åcant main effect for time or interaction, post-hoc tests were performed using a simple effects analysis with the Bonferroni adjustment.  To analyze the difference between the COT and SYN apparel shirts for shirt weight and whole-body sweat volume and rate, a paired samples t-test was used. The level of statistical signiÔ¨Åcance was established a priori as P < 0.05. The SPSS statistical package (v17.0) was used for data (M)  standard deviations analysis. Data is presented as means (SD).  3. Results  3.1.  Physiological variables  3.1.1.  Exercise intensity  There was no signiÔ¨Åcant difference in workload between the clothing conditions (P ¬º 0.989).

Discussion  This study aimed to investigate the effects that a form Ô¨Åtted, moisture-wicking fabric shirt, promoted to have improved evapo- rative and ventilation properties, has on the thermoregulatory, physiological and perceptual responses during moderate intensity exercise in the heat. An exercise protocol of 50% VO2peak for 45 min in environmental conditions of 33 C/60% RH was selected in order to impose a heat load signiÔ¨Åcant enough to stress the ther- moregulatory system of the recreationally active participants and to simulate conditions often imposed on an individual while aerobically training in the summer. Furthermore, the protocol was utilized to produce a sufÔ¨Åcient heat load where the moisture- wicking fabric shirt may prove beneÔ¨Åcial in the maintenance of body temperature and performance without providing a metabolic load so severe that fatigue sets in too early, not stressing the thermoregulatory system adequately (Gavin et al., 2001). The most interesting Ô¨Ånding in the present study is that during the last 15 min of exercise Tre was signiÔ¨Åcantly lower in SYN compared to COT. This is inconsistent with previous research investigating garment effects on Tre during exercise in similar en- vironments (Brazaitis et al., 2010; Gavin et al., 2001). Gavin et al. (2001) reported no signiÔ¨Åcant difference in Tre when examining the difference between polyester and cotton garments (short- sleeved t-shirts, shorts and socks) on thermoregulation during  Fig. 5.

The intermittent nature of the exercise combined with moisture regain properties of the fabric may be credited for the differences in sweat rate observed in the previously mentioned studies and the present one. Cotton fabrics have high sorption properties (Dai et al., 2008); therefore during periods of rest, the increased wetness of the cotton fabric may have cooled the skin and decreased overall sweat rate. Thermal conductivity has been shown to increase in clothes with high regain properties. This would result in a decrease in the temperature within the clothing microclimate and possible chilling of the participant (Satsumoto et al., 2009). Brazaitis et al. (2010) found that during post-exercise recovery MTsk tended to decline to lower than pre-exercise levels in participants wearing cotton shirts compared to polyester ones, revealing the ability of clothing with high regain properties to cool the skin in a rested state. The use of a continuous protocol in the present study would have assuaged the conductive heat loss from a cool and saturated garment on the skin, possibly increasing reliance on the evapora- tion of sweat for heat dissipation. Furthermore, Ha et al. (1999) postulated that a lower sweat rate may be due to the combined effects of moisture regain and air permeability, which may be acceptable, since the present study reveals that these properties have no effect on sweat rate independent of each other. The cotton shirt retained a signiÔ¨Åcantly greater amount of sweat than the SYN shirt. This exhibits the high sorption property of the cotton fabric and increased ability of the SYN to promote greater evaporation of sweat. These Ô¨Åndings agree with other studies uti- lizing similar protocols and environmental conditions (Gavin et al., 2001; Brazaitis et al., 2010). Gavin et al. (2001) and Brazaitis et al. (2010) both demonstrated properties of less sweat sorption in the polyester condition with no impact on temperature regulation during exercise in the heat. The increased moisture-wicking ability of the SYN condition did not subsequently alter body weight loss as no signiÔ¨Åcant difference was observed, further reinforcing the notion that the reduced weight of the SYN shirt was due to its greater evaporative characteristics. An increase in exercise duration may prove beneÔ¨Åcial to future research. In the present study, as exercise duration progressed there was a main effect between COT and SYN with respect to Tre. It is possible that the evaporative fabric plays a larger role in the maintenance of core temperature during prolonged exercise in the heat (>45 min). The relationship between increasing core temperature and decreasing exercise capacity has been demonstrated in previous research (Galloway and Maughton, 1997). If the observed trend continued past 45 min of exercise, the SYN garment may prove beneÔ¨Åcial in reducing the possibility of heat related illness and in the maintenance of aerobic performance during prolonged exercise in the heat. The ability of the SYN to retain less moisture and evaporate sweat more efÔ¨Åciently may reduce the overall heat load on the body by being less of a barrier and allowing for greater heat dissipation to the environment. It should also be noted that rectal temperature has been shown to lag behind core temperature (Sparling et al., 1993). Therefore, simi- larities in Tre between conditions may have resulted, if exercise progressed beyond 45 min. In both conditions HR quickly increased within the Ô¨Årst Ô¨Åve minutes of exercise before leveling off with gradual increases until the cessation of exercise. Overall, there was no signiÔ¨Åcant differ- ence between clothing conditions, possibly due to the equivalent amount of participant Ô¨Çuid loss and comparable exercise intensity. Therefore, despite a difference in garment fabric and properties a uniform cardiovascular stress was observed between trials. These Ô¨Åndings are similar to Gavin et al. (2001), who found no signiÔ¨Åcant difference in HR between cotton and polyester garments during exercise in the heat. Conversely, Ha et al. (1995) found that  Fig. 7.

In the present study, a mesh back in the SYN condition, but not in the COT condition, may have resulted in greater ventilation due to higher air permeability, contributing to the observed differences in Tre. The polyester garments in both the Brazaitis et al. (2010) and Gavin (2003) studies were not reported to have a ventilated mesh back, possibly explaining why no difference in Tre was found. Zhang et al. (2002) demonstrated that clothing with high air permeability resulted in signiÔ¨Åcantly lower Tre during exercise in the heat with wind, but not without wind. Likewise, Brownlie et al. (1987) found that clothing with limited vapor permeability caused a signiÔ¨Åcant increase in Tre during exercise in the heat with wind. In the present study wind was not utilized, although it can be inferred that the use of wind would further reduce Tre in the SYN condition because of its superior permeability properties. Clothing with increased air permeability will increase heat loss via convection as the wind carries away warm air sur- rounding the body (Zhang et al., 2002; Bouskill et al., 2002). In- creases in air movement by wind or the movement of the body will facilitate heat dissipation in both conditions, but an even greater affect would result in the SYN condition due to its superior permeability. The COT fabric‚Äôs higher absorption and reduced permeability creates a thicker ‚Äòstill air barrier‚Äô between the skin and the environment (Woodcock, 1962). This could lead to decreases in dry heat transfer and a possible rationale for an increase in Tre. There was no signiÔ¨Åcant difference in cumulative sweat volume at the chest, back, forearm and thigh, suggesting that clothing of different fabric and characteristics may not affect sweat loss. This is in contrast to Ha et al. (1999), who found that fabrics with high air permeability and moisture regain had lower sweat rates during intermittent exercise (30% VO2peak) at 27  C. Similarly, Kwon et al. (1998) reported greater sweat rates in participants wearing a  Please cite this article in press as: De Sousa, J., et al., The effects of a moisture-wicking fabric shirt on the physiological and perceptual responses during acute exercise in the heat, Applied Ergonomics (2014), http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2014.04.006  
J. De Sousa et al.  / Applied Ergonomics xxx (2014) 1e7  7  participants wearing polyester garments had a higher HR than those wearing cotton garments during intermittent exercise (30% VO2peak) at 27 C. The researchers cited reduced thermal insulation due to absorption of moisture by the cotton fabric as the cause for accelerated heat loss and lower HR. However, the increase in moisture absorption because of high regain properties in the cotton garment would allow for delayed evaporative cooling during the recovery phase. This was not observed in the Gavin et al. (2001) and present studies, which employed continuous exercise. Interest- ingly, and contrary to Ha et al. (1995), Brazaitis et al. (2010) did not observe any difference in HR between conditions during intermit- tent exercise or during 60 min of seated recovery. Exercise in the heat at a constant intensity is associated with an increase in RPE as duration progresses (Gonzalez-Alonso et al., 1999). Both the COT and SYN conditions followed similar trends of steadily increasing with exercise duration. However, no signiÔ¨Å- cant difference in RPE was attributed to the type of garment worn. Similarly, perception of skin wetness and thermal comfort did not differ with respect to both conditions. Even though the COT fabric absorbed more moisture and weighed more than the SYN, it did not alter the participant‚Äôs perception to thermal comfort, sweat sensation or perceived exertion. This agrees with Gavin et al. (2001) and Brazaitis et al. (2010), who found no differences in thermal comfort and sweat sensation between exercise ensembles at any time point, despite the cotton shirt absorbing signiÔ¨Åcantly more sweat from pre to post exercise. It appears that the sorption properties and type of garment fabric plays no role in the percep- tion of thermal comfort, sweat sensation and exertion during ex- ercise in the heat. In conclusion, the form Ô¨Åtted, moisture-wicking fabric shirt, promoted to have improved evaporative and ventilation properties produced a signiÔ¨Åcantly lower Tre during the last 15 min of exercise when compared to a cotton garment. The synthetic polyester shirt exhibited superior evaporative characteristics and lower regain qualities. Moreover, as exercise duration increases, the SYN shirt may prove beneÔ¨Åcial in the preservation of body temperature, thus reducing the likelihood of heat related illness and maintaining exercise performance in the heat.

s0003687014000490,"  Clothing is commonly made of fabric and covers over the three- dimensional (3-D) human body. Due to the speciÔ¨Åc geometry of human body shape and unique fabric properties, the space devel- oped between these two surfaces and the overall contour formed along the body represents the garment Ô¨Åt. As the garment Ô¨Åt de- pends on many factors, such as individual perceptions, clothing fashion style, function, it is hard to deÔ¨Åne it (Ashdown et al., 2004; Song and Ashdown, 2010). Garment Ô¨Åt is crucial for the perfor- mance of protective clothing. In thermal protective clothing, the air gap thickness between clothing layers and the body affected the thermal damage to the skin (Song and Lu, 2013). Garment style and Ô¨Åt inÔ¨Çuenced thermal protection, as the inappropriate Ô¨Åt of the clothing style reduced its protection (Mah and Song, 2010b). In the effort to improve the protective performance of protective clothing, various garment design approaches were employed. The overall modiÔ¨Åcation of protection was associated with the air gap  * Corresponding author. Tel.: √æ1 780 492 0706; fax: √æ1 780 492 4821.

Protective clothing often required a stringent confor- mity to body dimensions, as garments that were out of proportion to the wearer might result in accidents or impair efÔ¨Åciency and safe work performance (Robinette, 1986; Hsiao et al., 2002; Wang et al., 2011). For example, a crotch length that was too long might prevent a worker from moving quickly or might tear and leave him vulnerable to hazardous materials (Keeble et al., 1992). The garment Ô¨Åt had great inÔ¨Çuence on the air gap size and distribution (Kim et al., 2002; Song, 2007), which greatly affected the heat and mass transfer in the microclimate under clothing and range of mobility (Huck et al., 1997; Kim et al., 2002; Mah and Song, 2010b). To design well-Ô¨Åtted protective clothing and provide guidelines on the selection of protective clothing, Ô¨Åt analysis of protective clothing is necessary. Current methods of analyzing garment Ô¨Åt calculated the dif- ference between linear garment measurements and linear body measurements. Although these were useful for evaluating simple garment Ô¨Åt issues, they were not adequate to investigate the multifaceted relationship between the body and clothing. The 3-D body scanner captured three dimensional nature of human body and provided valuable information to analyze the garment Ô¨Åt (DesMarteau, 2000). Kim et al. (2001) investigated wearing ease,  Please cite this article in press as: Lu, Y., et al., A novel approach for Ô¨Åt analysis of thermal protective clothing using three-dimensional body scanning, Applied Ergonomics (2014), http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2014.04.007

There were a great number of smaller air gaps over the mannequin than larger ones. The principle of air gap measurement was the same with previous study of Kim et al., i.e. the magnitude difference of two vectors with the same direction originated from the centroid of nude body scan. Due to the irregular proÔ¨Åle of human body, this principle might cause signiÔ¨Åcant error in concave or convex area such as chest and pelvis regions. Recently, Psikuta et al. (2012) measured the air gap size and distribution, and the contact area of daily wear clothing by Geomagic software. However, the method used in air gap deter- mination was not provided. The purpose of this study was to conduct systematic exploration on Ô¨Åt analysis of thermal protective clothing using 3-D body scanning technology. It was also the intention of this study to develop a new approach to characterize the 3-D Ô¨Åt relationship between protective clothing and human body. In this study, a proposed approach using 3-D body scanning to characterize Ô¨Åt of selected clothing was developed. The air gap size and distribution for these clothing were statistically analyzed. The air volume was employed as an index to depict the spatial relationship between the clothing and human body. The effects of garment design features including fabric properties and garment size on Ô¨Åt were also investigated.  2. "

In nine male subjects, a vest with water soaked cooling pads and a vest with water perfused tubes were compared to a control condition. Subjects performed 30 min walking and 10 min recovery in hot conditions, while physiological and perceptual parameters were measured. No differ- ences were observed in heart rate and rectal temperature, but scapular skin temperature and Ô¨Çuid loss were lower using the perfused vest. Thermal sensation was cooler for the perfused vest than for the other conditions, while the cool pad vest felt initially cooler than control. However, comfort and RPE scores were similar. We conclude that the cooling effect of both tested systems, mainly providing a (temporally) cooler thermal sensation, was limited and did not meet the expectations. √ì 2014 Elsevier Ltd and The Ergonomics Society.

In combination with heavy physical exercise and protective equipment, this may lead to heat strain (Barr et al., 2010; Cheung et al., 2010). The concomitant reduction in cognitive and physical capacity compromises opera- tional capability, endurance and safety (Galloway and Maughan, 1997; Hancock and Vasmatzidis, 2003; Hunter et al., 2002; MacDougall et al., 1974; Nielsen et al., 2001; Nybo, 2007). External cooling mechanisms could attenuate heat strain and counteract these adverse consequences. Most research has been performed on rapid cooling of the Ô¨ÅreÔ¨Åghter after his work or during short breaks (e.g. Barr et al., 2011; Carter et al., 1999; House et al., 1997; Selkirk et al., 2004; Zhang et al., 2009). However, only a few studies investigated direct active cooling during work (e.g. House et al., 2013), which may be the most effective way of reducing heat strain. For Ô¨Åremen this implies the use of a portable cooling system worn under the personal protective clothing. Available cooling systems generally use cooling by air, liquid or phase change materials (PCM). In exercising athletes (Teunissen et al., 2013) as well as in pilots (Reffeltrath, 2006) and military forces (Barwood et al., 2009b), air  * Corresponding author.

However, Ô¨Åremen often work in contaminated environments, while sufÔ¨Åcient air Ô¨Åltering is difÔ¨Åcult. An attempt to feed the exhaust gases from the breathing apparatus back into the suit to enhance evaporative cooling, was not effective (Williams et al., 2011). Possibly, the air layer between clothing and skin is rapidly saturated, limiting the effect of (ambient) air cooling. Cooled air systems may be more effective, but are usually rather complex and heavy. A PCM cooling vest contains a solid substance which absorbs heat while changing to a liquid state. Ice vests are a well-known example. In practice, PCM is often the most usable cooling tech- nique because of its simple mechanism and unpowered nature. Its use under protective clothing can decrease heat strain (Bennett et al., 1995; Cadarette et al., 2002; Chou et al., 2008; House et al., 2003) and increase time to exhaustion (Kenny et al., 2011). Nevertheless, not all studies found positive effects (Carter et al., 2007). It is possible that a PCM vest impairs sweat evaporation from the body and does not provide a positive contribution to the heat balance (Gao et al., 2011). From the perspective of maximum heat removal, liquid cooling by tubed garments is probably the most effective cooling technique. In general, a tubed vest Ô¨Ålled with circulating cold water or glycol provides direct conductive cooling, extracting up to 170 W under optimal conditions (Frim et al., 1996). However, the system requires  Please cite this article in press as: Teunissen, L.P.J., et al., Evaluation of two cooling systems under a Ô¨ÅreÔ¨Åghter coverall, Applied Ergonomics (2014), http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2014.04.008

Cool pad system  The cool pad system consisted of a light-weight vest (polyester mesh in side and body area, and PU-laminated polyester fabric in pocket area) and four nonwoven pads (350  115  7 mm in size) Ô¨Ålled with superabsorbent polymer (acrylic resin), weighing about one kilogram in total with soaked pads. The pads were soaked in water till saturation and kept in a refrigerator (4  C) for at least 24 h. Just before the start of the walking test, the pads were taken out of the refrigerator and inserted into the vest pockets: two at the back side and two at the front side (Fig. 1).  2.3.2. Water perfusion system  The water perfusion system consisted of a tubed vest, connected to a backpack with two frozen bottles in a sealed inner bag that was Ô¨Ålled with cold tap water to the line, and a pump (Fig. 2). In total, the system weighed about four kilograms. Half an hour before the start of exercise, the frozen bottles (500 ml) were put in the inner bag to precool the water. Just before the start of the walking test, the vest and backpack were put on, connected, and the pump was activated. After the test, the bottles were taken out, the water was pulled off, and the tubes were emptied. Before the measurement session, participants inserted a rectal probe themselves and were weighed in underpants to determine In addition, shoes √æ socks, T-shirt √æ heart rate nude body mass. strap, and coverall were weighed separately. Then the heart rate and skin temperature sensors were attached and subjects put on the under- and outer layer garment, before entering the climatic chamber. The protocol in the climatic chamber started with 30 min of habituation to the hot conditions and Ô¨ÅreÔ¨Åghter suit. During this period subjects sat quietly on a chair.

It is possible that the signiÔ¨Åcant bulk, weight, and power dependence of these systems restrict its mobility and offset its beneÔ¨Åts (McLellan et al., 2013). It is still a challenge to develop optimal cooling systems for use during operational tasks. Previous studies on this topic have mostly focused on physiological measures and performance. Perceptual measures like thermal sensation and thermal comfort have been described less frequently, but may affect the initial selection of exercise intensity (Schlader et al., 2011b) and control thermoreg- ulatory behavior (Schlader et al., 2011a). Perception is not always in line with performance. Daanen et al. (2013) recently showed that people feel fatigued after sleep deprivation but this has no impact on performance. In contrast, work in the heat showed a decrement in performance while people assessed that they can do the job easily. A discrepancy between perception and performance may lead to overestimation or underestimation of the risks and thus to injury. Therefore, the inclusion of perceptual measures is important for gaining knowledge on the interaction of perceptual, physio- logical and performance measures, as well as for the successful implementation of a cooling system. The current study investigated two chest cooling systems for use under Ô¨Åre protective garments. The Ô¨Årst newly developed cooling vest uses pads which have been soaked in cold water, providing conductive cooling without the need for ice, pump or power. This resulted in a very light-weight mobile vest, which may slightly limit evaporative efÔ¨Åciency (Gao et al., 2011). The second cooling vest is a more traditional tubed liquid cooling system with cold perfusing water, using ice bottles in a small backpack for heat exchange. The compact conÔ¨Åguration limits the weight and power requirements, but the aforementioned disadvantages regarding vasoconstriction and evaporative impairment still remain. Both systems were worn under a Ô¨ÅreÔ¨Åghting coverall and compared to a control condition during 30 min treadmill walking and 10 min recovery in hot con- ditions. Both physiological and perceptual parameters were investigated.  2. "
s0003687014000519,"  The level of effort required to carry an additional mass at different locations on the body is important in ergonomics, military applications, obesity and in the design of prosthetics and powered exoskeleton devices. Biomechanical parameters such as ground reaction forces (Birrell et al., 2007; Birrell and Haslam, 2010; Castro et al., 2013), joint kinematics (Attwells et al., 2006; Birrell and Haslam, 2009, 2010; Majumdar et al., 2010; Simpson et al., 2012) and muscle activation using electromyography (Grenier et al., 2012; Knapik et al., 1997) have been used to study load carrying. For example when comparing different methods for carrying the same load, the method that yields lower ground reactions and EMG will be considered better. While biomechanical parameters can be used for assessing changes in walking, typically the level of effort is considered  * Corresponding author. Tel.: √æ972 8 647 232; fax: √æ972 8 647 958.

Nevertheless, the most common physiological effort is quantiÔ¨Åed using the metabolic rate which is the amount of energy required by the body to perform an activity (Margaria, 1938). An understanding of how the metabolic rate changes as a function of the additional mass at different walking speeds and body locations is important in designing body armor and protective gear (such as for Ô¨Åremen) since the increase in user effort can limit the use of the gear it- self. Furthermore, in the case of assistive technology such as orthopedic braces and active orthosis, the devices, which are performing work during gait cycle, assist the user in restoring locomotion capability. In addition it is preferable that the reduction of the metabolic rate due to the assistance of a particular device be greater than the additional metabolic rate due to the device mass (Collins and Kuo, 2010; Donelan et al., 2008; Sawicki and Ferris 2008). Previous studies in load carrying have found that the main factor that produces changes in metabolic rate are the speed of locomotion (Bastien et al., 2005; Browning et al., 2007; Soule and  Please cite this article in press as: Schertzer, E., Riemer, R., Metabolic rate of carrying added mass: A function of walking speed, carried mass and mass location, Applied Ergonomics (2014), http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2014.04.009  
2  E. Schertzer, R. Riemer / Applied Ergonomics xxx (2014) 1e11  Goldman, 1969) and the magnitude and location (center of mass) of the additional mass relative to body segments (Browning et al., 2007; Soule and Goldman, 1969; StuempÔ¨Çe et al., 2004). Meta- bolic rate is also referred to in the literature as metabolic cost. However, since we are actually measuring metabolic power [w/ s], we prefer the use of the term ‚Äúrate‚Äù. It was also found that for loading on the lower extremity, the change in the mass distri- bution (i.e., the moment of inertia) also affects the metabolic rate (Royer and Martin, 2005). It was suggested that metabolic rate increases linearly with mass increase (Bastien et al., 2005; Browning et al., 2007) and speed (Keren et al., 1981). Yet other studies indicate a nonlinear relation between the increase in speed and the metabolic rate (GrifÔ¨Ån et al., 2003; Bastien et al., 2005). Abe et al. (2004) and Bastien et al. (2005) studied the cost of carrying a load on the back and depicted nonlinear re- lations between the metabolic rates for a given mass as a func- tion of the walking speed. This suggests that there is an optimal walking speed for carrying the load. Pandolf et al. (1977) developed prediction equations for the metabolic rates of walking speed and added mass. Their equa- tions take into consideration body weight, added mass (on the back, hands and ankles), walking speed, surface grade and terrain. Their work was groundbreaking since they were the Ô¨Årst to examine the combined effect of all these factors. But their study has two weaknesses: (1) it is not clear how they developed their Ô¨Åtted equation, and (2) they did not specify its prediction error. The metabolic rate of carrying loads at the knee has not been studied. Yet, the metabolic rate of carrying additional mass at the knee is important for knee braces, prosthetics (Kaufman et al., 2012; Pratt et al., 2004), and for usage as an energy harvester for the knee (Donelan et al., 2008; Riemer et al., 2010). In these devices the additional metabolic rate due to the mass can determine the device‚Äôs usefulness. Another important aspect of adding mass at different body locations is the relative metabolic rate of carrying the load. Previously, it was shown that carrying a mass at more distal locations results in higher metabolic rates (Browning et al ., 2007; Soule and Goldman, 1969). For example, the net meta- bolic rate (gross - standing) increases by 8% while walking at 1.25 m/s and carrying 4 kg on the shank compared to carrying the same load on the waist (Browning et al., 2007). The ratio between the metabolic rate of carrying a load on the ankle divided by the metabolic rate of carrying a load on the waist was calculated at a Ô¨Åxed walking speed and added mass. However, it is also important to investigate how the ratio of metabolic rate varies with changes in factors such as speed and mass. In addition it was shown that for mass carried on the back, the effect of the load is similar to an increase in body mass (e.g., Bastien et al., 2005; Goldman and Iampietro , 1962; Legg and Mahanty, 1985). However, it is not known if adding mass at either the ankle or the knee (Browning et al., 2007; Soule and Goldman, 1969) will have a similar effect (such as an increase in body mass). In our study we investigated the metabolic rate of carrying an added mass as a function of the walking speed, the magnitude of the added mass and its location. We then analyzed the meta- bolic rates of subjects walking with masses placed on the ankles, knees and backs. Using the results derived from our experi- ments, we developed an equation to predict the metabolic rate of carrying mass at ankle, knee and back . To the best of our knowledge , an analysis of the metabolic rates of masses placed on the knee has never been carried out before . Then we compared our equations to existing prediction equations (e.g., ACSM, 2000; Pandolf et al., 1977). In addition to determining the  error bound in our predictions, we also investigated the differ- ences in the metabolic rate of carrying a mass at distal vs. proximal locations and how the cost is affected by the walking speed and mass magnitude. Finally, we examined whether adding mass at either the ankle or the knee affects the metabolic rate in a way similar to what would happen if there were an increase in body mass.  2. Method  2.1.  Subjects  74.88  9.23 kg, Eight healthy male students (body mass: height: 178  6.21 cm, age: 26.77  2.65 y; mean  SD) from Ben- Gurion University participated in this experiment. All test sub- jects engaged 2e3 times a week in recreational sport; all were instructed to sleep for at least six hours on the night prior to the experiment. They were also instructed not to engage in strenuous physical activity for at least 12 hours prior to the experiment. Nor were they to eat two hours prior to the experiment (Hall et al., 2004). The study was approved by Ben-Gurion University‚Äôs Hu- man Research Institutional Review Board and all subjects signed an informed consent form.  2.2.  Experimental procedure  To investigate the effects of walking speed and load place- ment on metabolic rate , subjects walked with an additional mass on one location: the ankle, knee or back (the ankle and knee loading are bilateral). For each location of added mass, subjects walked at 4 , 5 and 6 km/h with either no added mass (no-load), or different magnitudes of mass for each speed. Table 1 summarizes all the trial conditions that each subject experienced (the total number of trial conditions is 37). All trials were performed on a treadmill (T2100 treadmill, General Elec- tric Healthcare , USA) with a zero gradient. The metabolic rate was measured using an indirect calorimetry system (Quark cpet, COSMED, Milano, Italy) and calculated using standard equations (Brockway, 1987). To become accustomed to walking on a treadmill while wearing a gas collection mask, each subject performed a pre- liminary trial at a speed of 6 km/h for 7 min. Then, after at least 5 min of rest, subjects performed a randomly ordered set of trials with different added masses. A set consisted of a speciÔ¨Åc load condition (e.g., 1 kg on the knee) performed at the different walking speeds (4, 5 or 6 km/h). All trials lasted 7 min to allow for the metabolic rate measurements to reach a steady state. Since for all trials, subjects reached a steady state in less than 4 min, the last 3 min of collected data from each trial were used for analysis. To avoid fatigue, subjects rested for at least 5 min between trials (Abe et al., 2004; Bastien et al., 2005; Browning et al.,  Table 1 Loading conditions used in the experiment.

At the ankle and knee, the mass refers to the added mass for each leg. Consequently, 0.5 kg at the ankle means that a person carries 0.5 kg on each leg resulting in a total of 1 kg added mass on the body.

E. Schertzer, R. Riemer / Applied Ergonomics xxx (2014) 1e11  3  2007), and the experiment was divided into 3 sessions of approximately three hours on different days. At each session, the subjects carried the added mass at a different location (i.e., Ô¨Årst session, ankle; second session, knee; third session, back), The order of the locations between the subjects was random. Subjects were allowed to drink water during rest periods and eat one small energy bar (70e100 kcal) per session (Browning et al., 2007). The limitation of one bar per session was chosen because a bar is approximately equal to the total metabolic rate a subject expended per session.  2.3.  Leg and back loading  The load magnitudes for each location were chosen based on relevant applications of added mass to legs such as powered exo- skeletons (Sawicki and Ferris, 2008) and biomechanical energy harvesters (Donelan et al., 2008) and a Robo Knee (Pratt et al., 2004). Since these devices range in mass from 0.75 kg to 2 kg, we chose 0.5e2 kg as representative masses. For the back, the maximum load was chosen so that the mass would not be more than 33% of the subject‚Äôs body mass. The loads were attached to the body using several methods, depending on the location. On the ankle, the added mass was connected with an ankles strap weight (Energy Gym, Delaware, USA) (Fig. 1A). On the knees, the mass was attached above the kneecap on a knee brace with a mass of 500 g (Trainer, Ossur, Reykjavik, Iceland) (Fig. 1B). This arrangement prevented the mass from slipping during walking. One subject could not Ô¨Åt his knee into brace because he had a large shank and therefore, we did not measure his knee trials. On the back, the mass was placed inside a backpack with a waist strap (Fig. 1C). The back load was constructed from packages of Ô¨Çour (1 kg each) with the backpack being packed from the bottom. The backpack straps were tight- ened to prevent the packages from moving inside the backpack during walking.  2.4. Data analysis  2.4.1. Metabolic rate  After measuring metabolic rate, the speciÔ¨Åc power of the subject mass was calculated by dividing the metabolic rate (MetR) during the trial by the subject body mass (MetR/BM). The prediction equations were developed using this parameter. To further study the effect of the mass location during each  experiment condition, a subject‚Äôs average metabolic rate was divided by the average total of the body mass and the load mass (BM √æ LM). It was thought that if the increase in metabolic rate is linearly related to the increase in mass, then, when normalizing to total mass (BM √æ LM), the experimental results as a function of speed would collide to one line and remain unaffected by the increase in the load.  2.4.2.  Prediction model at each location  Based on the experimental data, our aim was to develop a statistical model to predict the metabolic rate for carrying a mass at different body locations (ankle, knee and back). Since different people with various physical traits performed the experiment, we expected intra-subject variability (variances of the subject‚Äôs measures) and inter-subject variability (variances between sub- ject‚Äôs measurements). Therefore, a model that would take into account intra-subject and inter-subject variation was needed. Consequently, we chose to use the linear mixed model (LMM) statistical method, which enables us to calculate both types of variability. The LMM model assumes a linear relationship between the dependent variable and the independent variables and that the i.e., Œµ w N (0, s2). However, our error (Œµ) is normally distributed, preliminary analysis for metabolic rate as a function of speed and added mass showed that this assumption does not hold true. Therefore, a log transformation was used to make the relation linear and suitable for the LMM. After the transformation, the mathematical representation of our model is:  f √∞yij √û ¬º b0 √æ b1  speedij √æ b2  massij √æ b3  massij  speedij √æ gj √æ Œµij  (1)  is  yij  f(yij)  where the function that represents the log trans- formation; is the metabolic rate of the ith measurement condition of the jth subject; and b0 is the theoretical metabolic rate while standing. However, since our prediction equations were developed based on walking speeds of 4e6 km/h, these equations might not accurately predict the metabolic rate at lower walking speeds or when standing (b0). Therefore, b1, 2, 3 are the model coefÔ¨Åcients; g is the random effect of the subject; and Œµ is the random error of the ith measurement within the jth subject. The speed variable has units of km/h; the mass is in kg; and all the metabolic rate (yij) values are in W/kg. The metabolic rate is  jth  Fig. 1. Loading at different locations: (A) ankle loading with a strap weight (0.5, 1, 2 kg); and (B) knee loading using a knee brace and a strap; (C) back loading using a backpack (2, 7.1, 10.1, 16.1, 22.1 kg).

4  E. Schertzer, R. Riemer / Applied Ergonomics xxx (2014) 1e11  normalized to the subject‚Äôs body mass to reduce differences be- tween test subjects due to the variations in their weights. The above method was used to develop a model to predict the meta- bolic rate of carrying mass on the ankle, knee and back as a function of added mass and speed of walking.  2.4.3. Relation between the metabolic rate and the body location of the added mass  To study the relative effect of the location of the carried mass, we examined the metabolic rate ratios of walking while carrying loads. This ratio was calculated by dividing the meta- bolic rate predictions (obtained from Section 2 .4.2) of two different body locations. This division provided an equation that predicts the metabolic rate ratio between the locations as a function of the mass and speed of walking. Since we have three different body locations, three different ratios were derived: ankle-knee, ankle-back and knee-back. The equations for the knee and ankle were based on the added mass per leg; for the back , the mass refers to total mass carried on the back . Consequently, an adjustment was needed to compare the same mass magnitudes. Therefore , we multiplied the mass of the back by two to even both equations (e.g., 0.5 kg on the leg equals 1 kg on the back).  2.4.4.  ConÔ¨Ådence intervals of  the predictions  When developing prediction equations based on an experi- mental Ô¨Åt, it is important to determine the conÔ¨Ådence level since this indicates the magnitude of the possible error for each in- dividual‚Äôs prediction value. The following equation allows us to estimate the range of possible values at a chosen conÔ¨Ådence level (Eq. (2)):  (2)  confidence level : X0  where X0 is a vector of our factor‚Äôs values (speed and mass); b b is a vector of the model coefÔ¨Åcients; Z1 a/2 is the number of standard deviations of the normal standard distribution; and V0 is the model variance. V0 is composed of three different sub-variances that cause noise in the model: subjects (within intra-subject variability), error measures (between inter-subject variability) and estimated coefÔ¨Å- cient errors. Calculation of the possible error is achieved with the following equation:  b  b  Z1 a=2   p  Ô¨ÉÔ¨ÉÔ¨ÉÔ¨ÉÔ¨ÉÔ¨É  V0  error ¬º Z1 a=2   p Ô¨ÉÔ¨ÉÔ¨ÉÔ¨ÉÔ¨ÉÔ¨É  V0  (3)  (4)  V0 ¬º V √∞between√û √æ V √∞within√û √æ V √∞coefficients√û  V(between) is the variance between subjects, which is the noise due to different subjects with different physical traits. V(within) is the variance within subjects, which is the noise due to different measurements. V(coefÔ¨Åcients) is the variance of coefÔ¨Åcient estimation.  2.4.5. Comparing our prediction equations to previous prediction equations  To evaluate the accuracy of our prediction equation as compared to previously published prediction equations, all the predictions were compared to published results from other studies (Abe et al. , 20 04; Browning et al ., 2007; Duggan and Haisman, 1992; Legg et al., 1992; Soule and Goldman, 1969) . To create uniformity, all metabolic rates measurement reported in these studies were converted to W/kg . To evaluate our new prediction equations, we considered three existing equations and compared their no-load (i.e. , walking without load)  predictive capabilities to our equations (ACSM, 20 00; Pandolf et al., 1977; van der Walt and Wyndham, 1973). Note that Pandolf ‚Äôs equation was used with no-load on the back and a zero grade and terrain factor for a treadmill experiment. We compared our prediction accuracy of load carrying on the ankle and the back to Pandolf‚Äôs prediction accuracy where each experimental data record contains the walking speed, measured metabolic rate and the added mass. The mean square error (RMSE) was then calculated for each prediction equation. The lower the RMSE , the more accurate the prediction was considered to be.  3. Results  3.1.  Equations for prediction of  the metabolic rate  The relation between the metabolic rate and speed and added mass (Eq. (5)) has the following form:  Metabolic cost ¬º Exp√∞b0 √æ b1  speed √æ b2  weight √æ b3  weight  speed√û  (5)  where b0 theoretically represents the cost of standing with no load; b1 is the coefÔ¨Åcient of speed; b2 is the coefÔ¨Åcient of weight; and b3 is the coefÔ¨Åcient of the effect due to interactions between speed and weight. In all the three load conditions, the interaction be- tween weight and speed after log transformation was insigniÔ¨Åcant (p > 0.05), and the prediction equation for metabolic rate (Eq. (6)) takes the following form:  Metabolic cost ¬º Exp√∞b0 √æ b1  speed √æ b2  weight√û  (6)  The Ô¨Åtted equations, using the log transformation method, for each body location resulted in a signiÔ¨Åcant R2 value of 0.78, 0.83, 0.85 for the ankle, knee and back, respectively (P-value <0.05). The variability among the subjects was similar in magnitude to the variability within subjects (Table 2). Although after log transformation the interactions between the independent variables (speed and weight) were not statistically signiÔ¨Åcant in all three equations (ankle, knee and back), it should be noted that in the prediction equation (Table 2), there is still a multiplication connection between the independent variables (speed and weight). Therefore, there is still an interaction between mass and speed in determining the metabolic rate. Finally, the constant for standing with no load (b0) is similar but unequal for all 3 locations. The metabolic rate during walking increased with load magnitude and speed (Figs. 2A and B; 3A and B; 4A and B). In addition, the visual representation of the equation and experi- mental data show a good Ô¨Åt. For the ‚ÄúBack‚Äù, the metabolic rate divided by total mass (body and load mass) is only affected by the walking speed (Fig. 2C and D) and not by the load. For the ‚ÄúKnee‚Äù and ‚ÄúAnkle‚Äù, dividing the metabolic rate by total mass reduces the difference between the load conditions, but there is still an increase in the metabolic rate divided by total mass (Figs. 3 and 4C and D).  3.2.  ConÔ¨Ådence intervals of  the prediction equations  The conÔ¨Ådence intervals were calculated for all three equations. The interval size changes as walking speed increases and mass is added. However, the size of the conÔ¨Ådence intervals relative to the values of the prediction equations remains similar.

Metabolic rate ratio between the locations  After determining the metabolic rate of carrying a load at each of the three locations, we investigated the relative effort between the three locations by dividing the prediction equation for one location by the equation for a different location (e.g., knee by back). All three ratios resulted in an exponential equation (Table 5). Our Ô¨Åndings show that metabolic rate is higher when masses are located more distally and that the ratio between the meta- bolic rates for carrying loads at different locations changes  Please cite this article in press as: Schertzer, E., Riemer, R., Metabolic rate of carrying added mass: A function of walking speed, carried mass and mass location, Applied Ergonomics (2014), http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2014.04.009

for walking with no-load (Fig. 6, Table 6) and for load conditions on the ankle and back (Table 6). In all cases, our prediction equations resulted in a smaller RMSE for both no-load and load conditions (Table 6).  4. Discussion  In our study, we investigated the metabolic rate of carrying a mass at three different locations (ankle, knee, and back) as a function of walking speed and added mass magnitudes. An un- derstanding of the metabolic rate is important in designing body armor and protective gear (such as for Ô¨Åremen). Using our re- sults, designers can model the changes in metabolic rate as a function of the mass and their location. They can then use this information to formulate a design criterion (e.g., the addition of metabolic rate should not exceed 15% of a no-load condition). The new prediction equations that we developed for walking with no-load and walking with a load on the back and ankle were more accurate than previously developed equations, as shown by a relative reduction in RMSE of w7% for the no-load condition (i.e. , Pandolf‚Äôs equations vs. ours). While the equations of both Pandolf et al. (1977) and van der Walt and Wyndham (1973) demonstrate similar behavior to our predictions and to the data from published literature, the ACSM (2000) prediction equation is a linear curve that does not follow well the published data particularly for velocities above 5.5 km/h . For the ankle and back, the proposed prediction equations are more accurate than Pandolf‚Äôs with a lower RMSE of 69% for the ankle and 31% for the back.  Prediction equations that are based on an experimental Ô¨Åt are typically best applied only in the range for which the experimental data was obtained. However, the metabolic rate prediction model that was developed in this study obtained better results even for other data in which the conditions were outside the range of values used in our experiments (walking speed range of 4e6 km/h), for  Table 4 Ankle and knee loading metabolic predictions and at an interval size of 95% conÔ¨Å- dence level, at 9 different points that represent the data.

This suggests that, the developed model might be a better representation of the physiological process of load carrying. However, this must be tested in future experiments with lower and higher walking velocities. Previous studies have shown that when carrying a mass close to the trunk, the metabolic rate increases linearly with the load (Bastien et al., 2005; Goldman and Iampietro, 1962; Legg and Mahanty, 1985). This is similar to an increase in metabolic rate due to an increase in body mass (Bastien et al., 2005; Goldman and Iampietro, 1962; Legg and Mahanty, 1985). These results are similar to our Ô¨Åndings and support the methods that approximate the metabolic rate of human locomotion based on motion of the center of mass and total body mass (e.g., Alexander, 1995). Furthermore, carrying a mass at a more distal body location results in a higher metabolic rate relative to a more proximal location (Browning et al., 2007; Soule and Goldman, 1969). However, no previous study has investigated how this ratio changes as a function of walking speed and added mass. Our Ô¨Åndings show that as opposed to adding mass close to the trunk, the addition of the mass on the ankle and knee caused a nonlinear increase in the metabolic rate relative to the total mass (BM √æ LM). Moreover, results show that metabolic rate ratio is larger when the distal location is divided by the proximal location for low walking speeds with large amounts of carried  Table 6 Comparison of the different prediction methods and experimental results from the literature presented as the RMSE.

However, added mass. We believe this effect might be explained by changes in the work being carried out by the body‚Äôs joints and the ratio of net negative work to net positive work performed at the joints. With a model (Margaria, 1968) that describes the inÔ¨Çuence of muscle work on the metabolic energy cost of movement:  metabolic energy¬ΩJ ¬ä ¬º positive work¬ΩJ ¬ä  h√æ  √æ negative work¬ΩJ ¬ä  h   (7)  √æ     where the metabolic energy is in joules; h is the muscle efÔ¨Åciency during positive work; and h is the muscle efÔ¨Åciency during negative work. Using the above model and data published on the total me- chanical work done at the leg joint when walking at different velocities (Farris and Sawicki, 2012) it can be shown that in some cases changes in the ratio of the positive and negative mechan- ical work performed at the joint level could cause an effect similar to that observed when a load is being carried at distal locations (Fig. 5), e.g., a reduction in the carrying metabolic ratio between the ankle divided by back as the walking speed in- creases. Moreover, we believe that most of the changes in the joint work will occur during the swing phase since it was shown using sensitivity analysis that an error in estimating the leg segment mass changes the calculation of the torques of the joints mostly during the swing phase (Riemer et al., 2008). This effect is the same as the changes in the joint torques due to attaching the mass to the leg. However, in this study, we did not collect kinetic or kinematic data due to the limitations of our laboratory equipment and therefore, future work is required to investigate this topic. The limitations of this study are that the equations were deve loped using results from walking at approximately 2-h periods. However, some studies have shown that a load car- ried at constant speed for more than two hours results in an increase in metabolic rate (Epstein et al ., 1988; Patton et al ., 1991) . Other studies have shown that there was no increase (VO2 max ¬º 65 ml kg  1 min  1) walking un- for Ô¨Åt individuals der similar load conditions for four hours using a back load that is supported both by shoulder and waist straps (Sagiv et al., 1994) . Another issue is that our predictions were based on walking on a treadmill and there is a degree of uncertainty regarding the prediction validity for level walking for locations other than a treadmill. Previous studies pre- sented conÔ¨Çicting results when comparing walking on a treadmill with walking on a level ground track: Hall et al. (2004) found no differences while Pearce et al . (1983) found statistically signiÔ¨Åcant differences. However, in the latter study, the differences were smaller than 7%. Since we found that the prediction error for a given individual can be as high as 20%, the difference between the ground and the treadmill metabolic rate might not actually be so important as it is in the prediction error of the equations. Therefore , our equations may be useful in predicting ground level walking outside the lab. Future work should examine whether there is a difference between walking on a treadmill and walking on leve l ground and develop similar prediction equations for inclined and declined walking . Lastly, we think that in addition to providing information for able-bodied subjects, our prediction equations could have an impact in the Ô¨Åeld of rehabilitation for the design of orthotics and other wearable assistive devices. However, people with gait disorders have different gait mechanics (kinematics, kinetics) and metabolic rates than the normal population. Therefore, there  Please cite this article in press as: Schertzer, E., Riemer, R., Metabolic rate of carrying added mass: A function of walking speed, carried mass and mass location, Applied Ergonomics (2014), http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2014.04.009        
10  E. Schertzer, R. Riemer / Applied Ergonomics xxx (2014) 1e11  is a question of whether the results can be extended to pop- ulations with gait disorders. We believe that in the cases where the assistive device restores the gait mechanics to close to normal, the changes in the metabolic rate due to the addition of the mass will be similar to that of able-bodied subjects. However this requires more investigation of the gait disorder pollution, since what might be true for some disorders may not be true for others. In regard to improving the prediction equations of the metabolic rate, in this study we aimed for a model that would be as gener- alized as possible. Consequently, our prediction results were R2 in the range 0.78e0.85. These predictions might be improved by considering individual characteristic such as a self-selected walking  Calculating the possible error in our prediction equations (with a conÔ¨Ådence level of 95%) for any given combinations of mass and speed:  Appendix  error ¬º Z1 a=2   p  Ô¨ÉÔ¨ÉÔ¨ÉÔ¨ÉÔ¨ÉÔ¨É  V0  V0 ¬º V √∞between√û √æ V √∞within√û √æ V √∞coefficients√û  where V(between) √æ V(within) and their values are presented in Table 2 For all body locations.

Conclusions  This study investigated the metabolic rate of human subjects as a function of speed and load when walking and carrying different loads on the ankle, knee and back. We used a linear mixed model (LMM) with a log transformation to formulate our prediction equations. (This is the Ô¨Årst time in the literature that a prediction equation has been presented for the knee,). Comparison between our new equations to the best previously reported method (Pandolf et al., 1977) show improvement in accuracy. Further results show that contrary to mass carried on the back, mass attached to the leg cannot be modeled as an increase in body mass. Anther Ô¨Ånding is that the ratio for metabolic rate required for carrying a mass at different location (e.g. back vs. ankle) changes as a function of walking speed and mass and should not be treated as a Ô¨Åxed number. In brief, this study contributes to our understanding of load carrying and has implications in the design of devices that attach to the human body, such as shoes, orthopedic braces, pow- ered exoskeletons and body armor.

s0003687014000660,"  Cognitive Work Analysis (CWA; Rasmussen et al., 1994; Vicente, 1999) is an Ergonomics method that is used to describe and eval- uate complex sociotechnical systems. CWA has been applied in various complex sociotechnical systems such as defence (Burns et al., 2004), aviation (Ahlstrom, 2005), road transport (Cornelissen et al., 2013), and process control (Vicente, 1999). CWA is one of few formative methods within the discipline of Ergonomics. Formative methods aim to describe potential ways in which a system can operate, rather than describing how a system should operate (normative methods) or actually operates (descriptive methods) (Vicente, 1999). Formative methods are an important category of methods, as they are used to assist the design of adaptive and Ô¨Çexible systems and tools that can cope with non- routine situations. Non-routine situations, driven by emergence,  * Corresponding author. Tel.: √æ61 7 3735 5276. E-mail addresses: m.cornelissen@grifÔ¨Åth.edu.au (M. Cornelissen), Rod.Mcclure@ monash.edu (R.

Such systems exist in a highly changeable and demanding environment, in which adaptive capacity is essential (Vicente, 1999; Woods, 1988). Contemporary safety related concepts such as resilience (cf. Hollnagel, 2006) and performance variability (cf. Hollnagel, 2002, 2004) further underline the importance of methods to take adaptability of complex sociotechnical systems into account. Despite the popularity of CWA, reliability and validity analyses of formative methods remain largely absent from the Ergonomics literature. One of the few efforts to establish validity of CWA was conducted by Burns et al. (2004). They conducted a qualitative post hoc comparison of two independently conducted Work Domain Analyses (WDA), the Ô¨Årst phase of CWA, on similar defence sys- tems. More formal validation studies, including validation of latter phases of the CWA framework, are currently lacking. A recurring criticism aimed at the Ergonomics discipline is that some of the methods are only used by their developers and that methods are often chosen by practitioners based on familiarity and ease of use rather than based on reliability and validity evidence (Stanton et al., 2013). Many practitioners are unaware of whether the methods are reliable and valid (Stanton and Young, 1998).

Validation studies can beneÔ¨Åt Ergonomics methods by providing clear evaluation and empirical evidence of their performance and value (Stanton and Young, 1999, 2003). Further, a key requisite of ergonomics methods is that they are usable by non-experts and that they achieve acceptable levels of performance when used by other analysts (Stanton and Young, 1999, 2003). Without this, up- take of the method by ergonomics practitioners, designers and engineers may be limited. The aim of the study reported in this article was to provide a more formal reliability and validity analysis of CWA. This study was conducted using non-expert analysts to provide an evaluation of CWA‚Äôs level of performance when used by other analysts and ensure uptake of the method by ergonomics practitioners.  1.1.  Cognitive Work Analysis  The CWA framework comprises Ô¨Åve phases (Vicente, 1999). Each phase models a different set of constraints. First, WDA models the system constraints by describing what the system is trying to achieve and how and with what it achieves its purpose. Second, Control Task Analysis models situational constraints and decision- making requirements. Third, Strategies Analysis models ways in which activities within the system can be carried out. Fourth, social organisation and cooperation analysis models communication and coordination demands imposed by organisational constraints. Fifth, worker competencies analysis describes skills, rules and knowledge required for the activities possible within the system. To date, applications have focussed on the development and application of the Ô¨Årst two phases: WDA and Control Task Analysis. The third phase, Strategies Analysis, is useful for providing insight into the different response options that enable a systems adaptive capacity. This phase has traditionally not been as well developed  and neither applied as often as the earlier phases. Recently, the Strategies Analysis has regained attention (Cornelissen et al., 2012, 2013; Hassall and Sanderson, 2012; Hilliard et al., 2008). In particular, Cornelissen et al. (2013) developed and applied a structured method, the Strategies Analysis Diagram (SAD) to model strategies available in complex sociotechnical systems. Initial evaluations of this method have gathered evidence of the methods effectiveness to identify strategies possible (Cornelissen et al., 2012, 2013.); however, the method would beneÔ¨Åt from more formal evaluations. This paper is a response to this requirement.  1.1.1.  Strategies Analysis Diagram  The SAD method models how activities can potentially be executed within a system‚Äôs constraints. It also models criteria for when or why work will be executed in a certain way. SAD builds upon the Ô¨Årst phase of the CWA framework by adding verbs and criteria to the constraints identiÔ¨Åed. This allows further speciÔ¨Åca- tion of courses of action possible within the system‚Äôs constraints as well as criteria inÔ¨Çuencing the employment of courses of action. The SAD, see Fig. 1, is a networked hierarchical diagram using means ends links to represent ‚Äòhow‚Äô and ‚Äòwhy‚Äô relationships be- tween the different levels of the diagram. Links upwards explain why a certain object or function is there, whereas links downwards explain how a system works to achieve its purpose or execute its functions. The levels transferred from the WDA are illustrated in light grey and the SAD speciÔ¨Åc levels are dark grey. The lower half of the SAD models how activities can potentially be executed. The diagram describes, bottom up, verbs that describe potential interactions with or manipulations of objects in the sys- tem (e.g. follow), physical objects present in the system (e.g. lane markings), object related processes afforded by the physical objects (e.g. display information) and purpose related functions describing  Please cite this article in press as: Cornelissen, M., et al., Validating the Strategies Analysis Diagram: Assessing the reliability and validity of a formative method, Applied Ergonomics (2014), http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2014.04.010  
M. Cornelissen et al.  / Applied Ergonomics xxx (2014) 1e11  3  activities that need to be carried out for the system to achieve its purpose (e.g. determine path). The top half of the diagram describes why certain ways of work, or courses of action, are seen within the system. The top of the diagram describes top-down the functional purpose, this is the reason why the system exists (e.g. support negotiation of right hand turn by road users), values and priority measures evaluating the effectiveness of a system and driving behaviour (e.g. safety) and criteria, describing when certain courses of action at the lower end of the diagram are valid or likely to be chosen (e.g. high trafÔ¨Åc volume). Together, nodes from the different levels provide analysts with syntax for strategy deÔ¨Ånition. For example bottom up a strategy could be deÔ¨Åned as ‚Äòassess‚Äô ‚Äòroad users‚Äô ‚Äòshow behaviour‚Äô when ‚Äòavoiding conÔ¨Çict with other road users‚Äô. Assess whether the ‚Äòroad user is unfriendly‚Äô, for ‚Äòsafety‚Äô purposes and to ‚Äòsupport negotiation of right hand turns by road users‚Äô.  1.2.  Evaluating the Strategies Analysis Diagram  Based on initial evaluations of the SAD method (Cornelissen et al., 2012; Cornelissen et al., 2013) the evidence suggests that, when used by its developers, it can effectively identify a compre- hensive range of strategies available to humans performing activity within a particular system. Following this, the next critical step is to more formally evaluate the methods usefulness and ensure that the SAD can be applied by other practitioners. The methods‚Äô reliability and validity when used by novices in the SAD method should be established. The aim of the study reported in this article was to evaluate the performance of the SAD method when used by analysts not already skilled in the CWA framework. SpeciÔ¨Åcally, the study aimed to evaluate SAD in terms of its reliability and validity, when used by novice analysts to identify the range of strategies available to different road user groups at intersections. This allows for a more ample validation and reliability evaluation of formative methods.  1.2.1.  Reliability and validity analysis  Evaluating the methods criterion-referenced validity entails ensuring that the method allows analysts to come up with a SAD that contains accurate, and not too much irrelevant, content. Evaluating its test-retest reliability comprises ensuring that the method produces a similar model when used by the same analyst for the same system more than once.  1.2.1.1. Assessing  validity. Studies  assessing the validity of Ergo- nomics methods have been reported in the literature (Baber and Stanton, 1996; Stanton et al., 2009; Stanton and Young, 2003). Many of those have focussed on human reliability and error pre- diction methods (Baysari et al., 2011; Kirwan et al., 1997; Stanton and Young, 2003). In those studies, the validity of methods was assessed by comparing a method‚Äôs results (e.g. errors predicted) against actual observations (e.g. errors observed). Since the CWA framework is formative and models behaviour possible and include behaviour beyond that currently prescribed or actually seen within a system, a comparison of the methods results with actual obser- vations would not provide sufÔ¨Åcient conclusive evidence about the validity of the method. Alternatively, CWA results could be compared to results using a similar but validated method. However, CWA is unique in that it is a constraints-based approach and is one of few formative methods and substantial validation studies of such methods remain absent from the literature to date. Therefore, no method is available that could be used for SAD‚Äôs validation. Expert models are used when other validated standards are not available (Gordon et al., 2005). Expert models in the context of  CWA are models developed by expert analysts who are highly experienced in applying the methods from the CWA framework. It is worth noting that expert CWA models are not normative models representing the expert‚Äôs knowledge of a system, but rather well developed formative CWA analyses conducted by expert analysts. The assumption is that the expert model is most accurate and highly valuable in circumstances in which uncer- tainty exists and behaviour has yet to occur, is noisy or complex (Bolger and Wright, 1992). In absence of other objective standards, a model developed by expert analysts with no time constraints, is likely to be the best standard against which to compare other analysts‚Äô CWA results. Once the standard against which the novice analyst‚Äôs results will be assessed is established, measures to assess the quality of the novice results have to be determined. Quantitative methods to compare a expert results versus novices results (or predicted versus actual outcomes) are often based on the use of signal detection theory to calculate the sensitivity of the method under analysis (Baber and Stanton, 1994; Stanton et al., 2009; Stanton and Young, 2003). The signal detection theory sorts the method‚Äôs outputs into hits, misses, false alarms and correct rejections. Hits represent items identiÔ¨Åed by novice analysts that were also identiÔ¨Åed by expert analysts. Misses represent items that were identiÔ¨Åed by expert analysts but not by novice analysts. False alarms refer to those items identiÔ¨Åed by novice analysts and not the expert ana- lysts. Correct rejections are those items neither identiÔ¨Åed by the expert or novice analysts. The signal detection theory metrics are commonly used to assess the reliability and validity of ergonomics methods such as human error prediction (Stanton et al., 2009); however, not all of the metrics may usefully apply to formative methods. Since formative methods describe things that could be possible within a particular system, it is complicated to use the correct re- jections category because they are unknown and possibly inÔ¨Ånite. That is, theoretically the total number of items that could be included is anything in the world as we know it, as formative methods are not restrained by what is currently happening or should be happening. Therefore using an artiÔ¨Åcial number for the number of items representing the world would be inÔ¨Ånite and it is hard to know what items were actively rejected from this large pool of items by expert and novice analysts. While others (Stanton and Baber, 2002; Stanton and Stevenage, 1998) have been able to argue for a theoretical maximum based on a set number of tasks and error categories provided by a taxonomy, such theoretical maximum would be artiÔ¨Åcially inÔ¨Çated when used for formative methods. Therefore, it is argued that measures using correct re- jections are not suitable for assessing the validity of the SAD method. Measures involving hits, misses or false alarms can be used for the evaluation of CWA. Such measures include hit rate (hits divided by hits and misses), which allows comparison of items identiÔ¨Åed by novice analysts versus items identiÔ¨Åed by expert analysts. The false alarm rate cannot be used here as that includes using correct re- jections. To still account for the number of false alarms a novice analyst identiÔ¨Åes, a measure often used in clinical studies or recall studies can be used: positive predictive value (Descatha et al., 2009; Lindeg√•rd Andersson and Ekman, 2008). Predictive value (hits divided by hits and false alarms) reÔ¨Çects the amount of items identiÔ¨Åed by novice analysts that were also identiÔ¨Åed by expert analysts compared to the total number of items identiÔ¨Åed by novice analysts.  1.2.1.2. Assessing reliability. Reliability of Ergonomics methods is often assessed using a test-retest paradigm (Baysari et al., 2011). Measures include percentage agreement (Baber and Stanton, 1996;  Please cite this article in press as: Cornelissen, M., et al., Validating the Strategies Analysis Diagram: Assessing the reliability and validity of a formative method, Applied Ergonomics (2014), http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2014.04.010

Baysari et al., 2011) and Pearson‚Äôs correlation (Harris et al., 2005; Stanton and Young, 2003). As discussed above, the formative na- ture of CWA provides some challenges to traditional Ergonomics reliability and validity measures. To avoid unwarranted over- complicating of analysis, percentage agreement was applied here to evaluate the test-retest reliability. The reliability measure compares novice analyst‚Äôs items identiÔ¨Åed at two different times.  1.2.2. Multi analyst approach  CWA is a resource intensive method. The formative nature of the method requires participants to go beyond what they currently know which is a challenging activity. Further, the analysis concerns a complex system of which analysts may understand a part of the system in great detail while missing the lack of knowledge on other parts. A multi-analyst approach, using more than one analyst to conduct the analysis, is therefore practicable for a method such as CWA to decrease resources required and compensate for shortfalls of individual analysts (Stanton et al., 2009). Other validation studies have pooled individual results (Harris et al., 2005) or proposed multiple analyst approaches (Stanton et al., 2009). These approaches are suggested to increase the val- idity and comprehensiveness of the methods‚Äô results. Unfortunately, one of the main weaknesses of a multi-analyst approach is the increase in false alarm rate (e.g. items identiÔ¨Åed that are not accurate) (Stanton et al., 2009). To ensure that the beneÔ¨Åts of a multi-analyst approach outweigh the cost of intro- ducing false alarms, it is worth exploring strategies to reduce the false alarms and ensure the quality of the output. For example, it is assumed that if a method is accurate, relevant content should be identiÔ¨Åed more consistently than irrelevant content. A practical solution for a multi-analyst approach to CWA would be to only include items if more than one novice analyst generated that item or multiple analysts agreed on the relevance of that item in a group  discussion. Therefore, the present validity analysis includes both an unadjusted multi-analyst model (collating all individual items) and an adjusted pooled multi-analyst model (collating all individual items into one model, but eliminating all items that have only been identiÔ¨Åed by one novice analysts) to evaluate the value of a multi- analyst approach to SAD. Fig. 2 summarises the approach taken to evaluate the SAD method. Validity was measured by quantifying hit rate and pre- dictive value of participant‚Äôs results. Reliability was be measured by using a test-retest paradigm. Results were analysed for individual analysts as well as for a pooled multi-analyst approach. There were a number of hypotheses. It is expected that if the SAD method is valid, novice analysts‚Äô models will be similar to the expert analyst model. It is expected, however, that novice analyst‚Äôs models will fail to produce complete coverage of the expert ana- lyst‚Äôs model within the constraints of the study. Reasons for this include the use of novice analysts, time constraints of a reliability and validity study and the semi-structured formative approach of SAD. It is expected that by using a multi-analyst approach, and especially an adjusted multi-analyst model, results will improve and resemble the expert analyst‚Äôs model better. If SAD can be used reliably to conduct a SAD and elicit strategies, novice analysts‚Äô models over time are expected to be similar.  2. Method  2.1.  Participants  17 transportation safety professionals aged between 27 and 61 (M 38, SD 11) took part in the study, see Tables 1 and 2. While the participants were all professionals with an interest in Human Fac- tors, only 4 of them had applied CWA once or twice before but never in full (i.e. using all Ô¨Åve phases). None of the participants had  Please cite this article in press as: Cornelissen, M., et al., Validating the Strategies Analysis Diagram: Assessing the reliability and validity of a formative method, Applied Ergonomics (2014), http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2014.04.010

Therefore, all participants were considered to be novices in using the SAD method. Participants were recruited through professional association and university newsletters and were compensated for their time and expenses. Prior to commencing the study, ethics approval was formally granted by the Monash Human Ethics Committee. Participants were divided into two groups based on their availability for the workshops. The two groups however, were the same in regards to the process taken and the time constraints imposed on all activities.  2.2.  SAD analysis task  The study focused on drivers and cyclists turning right at urban signalised intersections in Melbourne, Australia. In Australia, road users travel on the left hand side of the road. A right hand turn per- formed on the main road involves crossing the intersection and continuing on the intersecting road. Cyclists can also travel on the footpath, which involves travelling across the intersection using the pedestrian crossings available to the far right corner as viewed from their approach, see Fig. 3. Right hand turns at urban signalised in- tersections were chosen, as it is a relatively complex task with ample opportunities for performance variability and therefore ideal to eval- uate the SAD. At the same time it also deÔ¨Ånes a reasonable boundary for the system under analysis as suggested by Naikar (2005).  2.3. Materials  Training material comprised descriptions and Ô¨Çowcharts of how to conduct an analysis using the WDA and SAD methods. Back- ground information, available throughout the entire exercise, consisted of de-identiÔ¨Åed quotes obtained from drivers and cyclists. These quotes described verbalised thought processes obtained while making right hand turns and post hoc explanation of cognitive processes underlying their decision making at the time; a more detailed description can be found in Cornelissen et al. (2012, 2013). Participants were furthermore provided with a WDA of the intersection ‚Äòsystem‚Äô. An extract of the WDA is provided in Fig. 2.  2.3.1.  Building the Strategies Analysis Diagram  Exercise material for building the SAD consisted of matrices in which participants could Ô¨Årst write possible verbs and criteria identiÔ¨Åed in columns on the left hand side and subsequently link them to for example physical objects, which were already provided in the top row. Participants used matrices rather than drawing a SAD by hand to make it easier for participants to keep track of their process and for the analysts to analyse the diagrams afterwards.  2.3.2.  Eliciting strategies from the Strategies Analysis Diagram  After participants built their own SAD they were provided with a SAD prepared for them, see Fig. 4, from which to elicit strategies. This was done to ensure that all participants elicited strategies from the same diagram and that elicitation was not inÔ¨Çuenced by how participants performed in building the SAD. Participants used SAD  Table 1 Participant background.

These Ô¨Çowcharts contained empty nodes from each level of the SAD for participants to Ô¨Åll out. From left to right the Ô¨Çowcharts contained nodes for verbs, physical objects, object related processes, criteria and values and priority measures.  2.4. Design  All participants underwent the same training and exercises. Workshop one (T1) was used to assess the validity of participant‚Äôs results using the SAD against the expert analyst results. In a second workshop (T2), a month after the Ô¨Årst workshop, participants completed the exercise again. The participant‚Äôs results at T1 were compared to their results at T2 to assess the test-retest reliability.  2.5.  Procedure  Participants each attended two workshops.  2.5.1. Workshop 1: data for criterion-referenced validity and test- retest reliability  In workshop one, upon completion of a demographic ques- tionnaire and informed consent form, participants received training in CWA, and speciÔ¨Åcally the SAD. The training consisted of an introduction to the method as well as a walkthrough of the method using road transport examples. Once familiar with the method, participants were given a training exercise in which they applied the method to a relatively simple system, the Apple iPod. In the training exercise participants could ask questions to ensure they fully understood the method before starting the main exercise. In the training exercise, partici- pants were given an hour to identify verbs and criteria and link them to the neighbouring levels in the SAD. They were then given 45 min to elicit strategies from the SAD. Following a break, participants started the main exercise. The exercise was explained to the participants and a step-by-step walkthrough of the materials provided was conducted.  Fig. 3.

Participants were once more prompted to the formative nature of the method and urged to identify possible verbs and criteria not only those currently seen in our intersection system. Participants were given an hour and 45 min to build a SAD. After a short break, participants were provided with a SAD prepared for them and were asked to elicit strategies from this diagram. Participants elicited strategies for a simple and complex scenario see Table 3. Participants were given 30 min to elicit stra- tegies for the simple scenario and an hour for the complex scenario.  2.5.2. Workshop 2: data for test-retest reliability  A month after the Ô¨Årst workshop participants returned for a second workshop. In workshop two, participants received a refresher training familiarising them again with the method. After the refresher training, participants started with the main exercise. This was the same exercise as in workshop one. Once Ô¨Ånished with the exercise participants Ô¨Ålled out a feedback form and were thanked for their participants and reimbursed for their expenses.  2.6. Data analysis  The expert model was developed by one analyst, and reviewed by two analysts, all with extensive experience in the CWA frame- work and SAD method. The validity of SAD was assessed by comparing the verbs, criteria and strategies in the participants‚Äô model (novice analyst) with those in the expert model (expert analyst). Measures of validity included hit rate and predictive value. The analysis is depicted in Fig. 5. The validity of the method using a multi-analyst approach was analysed by pooling individual participant‚Äôs analyses into a group model. That is, the raw data was combined into one group model and the verbs, criteria and strategies identiÔ¨Åed in this group model were compared to the expert analyst‚Äôs model. In addition, an adjusted multi-analyst model was tested to evaluate whether a practical solution could be found to counter the increase of false alarms in a multi-analyst approach. In the adjusted multi-analyst model, items were elimi- nated from the group model if only one novice analyst from the  overall group of 17 analysts generated it. The output of this approach is referred to in the text as the adjusted pooled model. The reliability of SAD was assessed by comparing participants‚Äô results at two different times, using a test retest paradigm. The verbs, criteria and strategies identiÔ¨Åed by participants at T1 were compared with the verbs, criteria and strategies identiÔ¨Åed at T2. To assess the reliability of a multi-analyst approach, items identiÔ¨Åed by all 17 novice analysts were combined into one group model and compared to the items identiÔ¨Åed by all 17 novice analysts at T2. In the adjusted multi-analyst model, items that were only identiÔ¨Åed by one of the 17 novice analysts were eliminated from the group model.  3. Results  3.1.  Criterion-referenced validity  3.1.1.

Participants were better at identifying relevant values and priority measures than criteria for both scenarios, see Fig. 8. This Ô¨Ånding is not surprising as the elicitation of values and priority measures was much more con- strained (6 values and priority measures versus 44 criteria) and therefore the chances of poor accuracy was lower. There were large differences between participants, with some identifying as little as 0e5% of the relevant criteria and others 40e50%.  3.1.2.5. Multi-analyst approach. Pooling of  the individual partici- pant‚Äôs criteria and values and priority measures into a group model was not conducted for this part of the analysis as participants identiÔ¨Åed different courses of actions and therefore the criteria and values and priority measures relate to different courses of action and cannot be pooled.  3.2.1.3.

Discussion  The aim of this article was to evaluate the criterion-referenced validity and test-retest reliability of the SAD method. The study represents a Ô¨Årst of a kind evaluation of reliability and validity of the SAD and one of the Ô¨Årst to conduct such evaluations for formative methods. Therefore the study adds to the knowledge base surrounding the reliability and validity of Ergonomics methods work (Stanton and Young, 1999, 2003). The analysis showed that individual results, within the con- straints of the current exercise, proved to be only moderate. This is especially true when compared to other reliability and validity studies, see Table 4. Group models, produced by pooling individual analyst output into one model, were more valuable than the indi- vidual models on its own. This suggests that the SAD method‚Äôs reliability and validity can be optimised through the use of a structured process whereby individual analysts Ô¨Årst conduct an analysis, following which the individual outputs are pooled by an independent analysts or the individual analysts are brought  Please cite this article in press as: Cornelissen, M., et al., Validating the Strategies Analysis Diagram: Assessing the reliability and validity of a formative method, Applied Ergonomics (2014), http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2014.04.010  
M. Cornelissen et al.  / Applied Ergonomics xxx (2014) 1e11  9  Engineers generated more content and relatively more false alarms, whereas Human Factors professionals generated less content but the content generated was more accurate. These differences were not statistically signiÔ¨Åcant but might explain some of the variation observed between individuals. The performance when using Er- gonomics methods of analysts with different discipline skill sets is therefore proposed as a pertinent line of further research. Table 4 summarises the reliability and validity scores of other Ergonomics methods that have been tested and reported on within the published peer reviewed literature. While these studies were conducted using structured human error prediction methods with limited number of categories for participants to chose from, it al- lows for relative evaluation of the scores obtained in the study presented in this article. The human error prediction studies did not report predictive value scores and therefore only hit rates are compared. This conÔ¨Årms that the individual novice analyst‚Äôs scores using the SAD are below average when compared with results obtained in other validation studies. This is not surprising, however, when one delves deeper into the structure of formal error predic- tion methods. For example, the Systematic Human Error Reduction and Prediction Approach (SHERPA, Embrey, 1986) bounds the analysis. Only a certain number of error modes can be selected for each task step depending on its behavioural classiÔ¨Åcation (e.g. as an Action or a Checking behaviour). This limits the extent to which analysts can achieve poor accuracy scores. SAD, on the other hand,  Fig. 7.

This Ô¨Ånding is not surprising since the CWA framework has typically been applied as a group process involving teams of ana- lysts (Birrell et al., 2011) or analyses being reviewed and adapted using other experts (Jenkins et al., 2008); however, it is an impor- tant Ô¨Ånding as it highlights the requirement for the SAD to be applied in a similar group manner. When combined with other positive pooled analyst study Ô¨Åndings (Stanton et al., 2009), it adds further weight to the notion that the Ergonomics design and evaluation process should follow a group process involving multi- ple analysts, regardless of the methods used. Further, based on the evidence from other reliability and validity studies it is likely that such approaches will prove beneÔ¨Åcial for applications of Ergo- nomics methods generally, including task analysis, error prediction and analysis, and accident analysis methods. The results demonstrated variability between participants. Whether such differences could be explained by experience in CWA, academic or industry background, Ô¨Åeld of study (e.g. whether Human Factors and Engineers performed differently), differences between groups, age or years of experience was investigated, however, no valid explanation could be found. An observation made during the workshops, however, was that Human Factors professionals and Engineering professionals did approach the ex- ercise differently. Human Factors professionals attempted to un- derstand the method and experienced blocks in generating verbs, criteria and strategies. Engineering professionals appeared to trust the method and started generating verbs, criteria and strategies with less scrutiny on what was generated. It was found that  Fig. 8.

10  M. Cornelissen et al.  / Applied Ergonomics xxx (2014) 1e11  validity scores of SAD, when using a multi-analyst approach, are promising. However, lessons were identiÔ¨Åed where the method can be improved. There are a number of reasons why the SAD method performed poorly when individual analyst outputs were examined. Partici- pants provided feedback that they found it hard to work with someone else‚Äôs output. Participants were provided a Ô¨Ånished WDA when building the SAD, and a Ô¨Ånished SAD when eliciting strate- gies. It is apparent that not being involved in development of the WDA and the SAD made it difÔ¨Åcult for participants to understand the language used and subsequently deÔ¨Åne the correct terms. Involvement of analysts throughout the model development pro- cess, spending considerable time to explain what each term means, and providing clearer guidance on how to deÔ¨Åne verbs and criteria all seem logical approaches that could be beneÔ¨Åcial and produce better outcomes. The language issue might explain why there was variety in the items identiÔ¨Åed over time. Participants reported that they were impressed by the expert model. Participants therefore might have remembered the items that they did not identify themselves (misses) better than the ones that they did identify themselves (hits) and ensured that they would come up with these additional verbs and criteria, for example, in the second workshop. Also, while most Human Factors task analysis methods have a structured process to start at the same step every time (e.g. Hier- archical Task Analysis (Stanton, 2006)) participants were free to start at any point in the SAD, and were even encouraged to use strategies to formatively identify new verbs and criteria. While this is beneÔ¨Åcial for innovation it is perhaps not inducing high levels of consistency. The evaluation of participant‚Äôs results and sorting them into categories of hits, misses and false alarms was conducted in a strict manner. If items were worded very differently (e.g. verb ‚Äòaccelerate‚Äô referring to actual interaction of ‚Äòpress‚Äô (pedal) or ‚Äòslow‚Äô versus ‚Äòrelease‚Äô pedal), or an incorrect level of detail was provided in describing the items identiÔ¨Åed (e.g. criteria ‚Äòweather conditions‚Äô versus ‚Äòwet conditions‚Äô), such items were counted as false alarms or misses. However, while such evaluation is appropriate for a reli- ability or validity study, a real world application of pooling results would Ô¨Ålter such false alarms out or reword them to Ô¨Åt the purpose of the application. The use of novices and the strict assessment protocol therefore provides a worst case scenario. Stanton and Stevenage (1998) for example used novices to apply human error identiÔ¨Åcation methods, in which the theoretical maximum of options was much more constrained than the current method, and found reliability scores between .4 and .6. They regarded those positive and attributed them to lack of experience of their participants since other papers using the same methods reported much higher performance when using experts for the same methods. Therefore reliability and val- idity results of SAD are expected to improve when more experi- enced analysts use the method. Stanton and Young (2003) also point out that the scope of analysis inÔ¨Çuences the results and that with a wider scope it is harder to get favourable reliability and validity statistics. It has been argued that novices perform better when using a simple system under analysis (Stanton and Stevenage, 1998; Stanton and Young, 2003) and for a complex system, experts outperform novices (Baber and Stanton, 1996; Stanton and Young, 2003). SAD analysis was performed on a complex system and the formative nature of the method provides for a wide scope of analysis. The current study presented a Ô¨Årst of a kind evaluation of the reliability and validity of a formative method, the SAD. While the measures used were found to be the most appropriate measures available in the literature to date, further research should address  Fig. 9.

The hit rates for the multi-analyst approach are a little lower than hit rates reported in human error studies. Reliability scores were considerably lower than those of human error predi- cation methods. Given the difference in nature of the methods, the  Table 4 Outcomes other validity scores.

Moreover, establishing the reliability and validity of Ergonomics methods is a key endeavour for all within the discipline, particularly to support increased involvement of Ergonomics methods and practitioners in the design and evaluation of safety critical systems. Continued discussion and investigation in this area is therefore encouraged. Future directions should focus on providing more detailed guidance on the SAD process and how to deÔ¨Åne verbs, criteria and strategies, similar to directions provided on conducting a WDA by Naikar et al. (2005). While in the current study the pooling exercise was conducted by a separate analyst, future directions include exploring the difference with such an approach and allowing the individuals who build their own models to pool their models into a group model through a structured group process.

s0003687013001270,"  Evidence suggests that back pain is frequent among children and adolescents (Harreby et al., 1999; Hakala et al., 2002; Watson et al., 2002; Jones et al., 2003; Murphy et al., 2007). According to the literature, the occurrence of back pain in children and adoles- cents has varied between 7% and 74% (Balagu√© et al., 1995; Jeffries et al., 2007). Similarly, neck or shoulder complaints are also fairly common among schoolchildren (Ehrmann-Feldman et al., 2002; Hakala et al., 2002; Auvinen et al., 2009). There is evidence that musculoskeletal pain in childhood and adolescence is a signiÔ¨Åcant risk factor for experiencing such symptoms in adulthood (Hakala et al., 2002; Siivola et al., 2004; Hestbaek et al., 2006). Therefore, to prevent musculoskeletal pain, we need to improve our under- standing of the risk factors associated with such complaints among children and adolescents (Trevelyan and Legg, 2006).  addresses:  * Corresponding author.

E-mail  1  Loads carried by schoolchildren and their role in the develop- ment of musculoskeletal pain among this age group has been the subject of recent attention (Grimmer and Williams, 2000; Negrini and Carabalona, 2002; Sheir-Neiss et al., 2003; Mackie et al., 2005; Murphy et al., 2007; Javadivala et al., 2012). There is evidence that schoolbags may be a factor contributing to musculoskeletal complaints in schoolchildren. Several studies have reported an association between carrying heavily loaded schoolbags and musculoskeletal pain or discomfort (Grimmer and Williams, 2000; Negrini and Carabalona, 2002; Sheir-Neiss et al., 2003; Dianat et al., 2013). As a consequence, a weight limit of 10%e15% of body weight (BW) has been recommended recently as a maximum load for schoolchildren based on epidemiologic, physiologic, and biome- chanical approaches (Brackley and Stevenson, 2004; Devroey et al., 2007; Bauer and Freivalds, 2009). However, there are still in- adequacies in the recommended schoolbag weight limit due to limited research in this area. To the authors‚Äô knowledge, there are several key issues that are still unresolved, making the applicability of this generic weight limit questionable. One is that the recom- mendations are mostly based on studies conducted in the devel- oped countries, and therefore giving no evidence that the results are generalizable to less developed countries.

Furthermore, most previous research has focused on low back pain, whereas much less attention has been given to the effects of load carriage on the other body regions such as neck and shoulders, areas which might also be affected by carrying schoolbags. Thus, understanding the epidemiology of this phenomenon is a valuable tool to develop guidelines and recommendations with regard to safe load carriage for schoolchildren around the world. This cross-sectional study was therefore conducted to investi- gate the occurrence of neck, shoulder and low back complaints in relation to the use of schoolbags and other potential risk factors among Iranian schoolchildren. One of the aims of the study was to evaluate whether or not the recommended weight limit for car- rying schoolbags should be gender-speciÔ¨Åc. In addition, as the literature is somewhat limited and the Ô¨Åndings are varied, this study adds more evidence to the debate and identiÔ¨Åes broader is- sues (e.g. different educational philosophies, sociocultural contexts, etc.) and also widens the discussion to more countries. It is also of particular interest as it considers the effect of schoolbag carriage on several body regions.  2. Materials and methods  This cross-sectional study was performed between February and June 2011, in the city of Tabriz (population about 1.58 million), the fourth largest city in Iran and the capital of East Azerbaijan province in Northwest Iran. A sample of 586 students aged 12e14 years (who were in grades six through eight) participated in the study. A three stage sampling procedure was used to obtain a representative sample of schoolchildren in the study area. In the Ô¨Årst stage, Ô¨Åve educational districts were chosen (as strata), and then in the second stage, a total of 20 schools were selected randomly from the dis- tricts (including two boy‚Äôs schools and two girl‚Äôs schools from each district). Finally, the study participants were chosen randomly from each school. Permission to approach schools in the study area was obtained from the Tabriz Department of Education and the school authorities involved. The study protocol was approved by the ethical review committee of Tabriz University of Medical Sciences. The students were given a letter asking for parental consent for them to take part in the study. The data were collected by two trained investigators (authors of this paper). The weights (body weight and schoolbag weight including any additional items carried separately) and standing height were measured using a digital electronic scale (accurate to 0.01 kg) and portable stadiometer, respectively. The data were collected on an unannounced day so that children could not alter their schoolbag weight. The scale was calibrated over a range of known weights prior to data collection. Body mass index (BMI as weight/height2) was derived from measurements of height and weight. The questionnaire used in the study was developed based on data in the literature. The Ô¨Årst item on the questionnaire was to record demographic details (including age, gender and grade level) of each student. The occurrence of neck, shoulder and low back complaints during the preceding month was recorded according to a modiÔ¨Åcation of the standardised Nordic Musculoskeletal Disorders Questionnaire (Kuorinka et al., 1987). The validity and reliability of the Nordic questionnaire have been established previously (Kuorinka et al., 1987; Dickinson et al., 1992). The English version of Nordic questionnaire has already been translated and revised into Persian language (Ghaffari et al., 2006). The questions about neck, shoulder and low back pain were as follows: ‚ÄúHave you, at any time during the past month, had trouble (such as ache, pain, discomfort or numbness) in the following areas of your body?‚Äù 1) Neck, 2) shoulders, and 3) low back area. The location of these anatomic areas was demonstrated by a drawing in the questionnaire. The response  alternatives were ‚Äúno‚Äù and ‚Äúyes‚Äù. The questions regarding the use of schoolbags were based on the relevant literature (Grimmer and Williams, 2000; Goodgold et al., 2002; Negrini and Carabalona, 2002; van Gent et al., 2003; Dianat et al., 2013) and included infor- mation about the type of schoolbag, time spent carrying a schoolbag to and from school each day, preferred method of carrying a schoolbag and mode of transportation to and from the school. The amount of time spent on sport and physical activities, watching television and using a computer was also recorded. The question- naire was evaluated in a pilot study on a sample of 50 school stu- dents and minor revisions related to clarity and wording were made based on the pilot testing feedback. Also, the test-retest reliability (stability) of the items of the questionnaire was acceptable (phi coefÔ¨Åcients ranged from 0.72 to 0.91). The whole questionnaire, administered by interviewing the children, took approximately 10 min to complete. Statistical analysis of the data was performed with SPSS soft- ware version 11.5 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Statistical analyses were performed for the whole sample and for the subgroups of students (e.g. by gender and educational grade level). Two-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) was used for evaluation of the main effects of gender and grade level on the schoolbag weight (both absolute weight and % BW) and time spent carrying a schoolbag. This analysis was followed by Tukey‚Äôs post hoc tests for pairwise comparisons. Similarly, multinomial logistic regression was applied to evaluate the effects of gender and grade level on the method of carrying and type of schoolbag as well as the mode of transportation to and from the school. The relationship between prevalence rates and study variables was assessed using binary logistic regression analysis. In addition, multiple logistic regression analysis was carried out using backward stepwise procedure to estimate the association between independent variables and self- reported neck, shoulder and low back pain in the multivariate context. The odds ratios (ORs) and 95% conÔ¨Ådence intervals (CIs) were calculated from the relevant multiple logistic regression models. The assumptions of the model (including the presence of outliers and collinearity) were checked and were not in violation. There was no sign of collinearity (e.g. the conÔ¨Ådence intervals were not wide). The Ô¨Åt of the logistic regression models was conÔ¨Årmed by the HosmereLemeshow goodness-of-Ô¨Åt test. P values < 0.05 were considered statistically signiÔ¨Åcant.  3. Results  The questionnaire was completed by all 586 schoolchildren (257 boys and 329 girls; age, 12.8  1.27 years; weight, 50.7  14.3 kg; height, 155.6  8.93 cm; body mass index, 20.7  4.6 kg/m2). The mean schoolbag weight (absolute weight) for all of the children was 2.8  0.94 kg (range, 0.86e6.5 kg), and the percent this represented 7.1  2.81% BW (range, 1.6e18.4% BW). The ANOVA revealed sig- of student body weight (% BW) for the whole sample was niÔ¨Åcant differences in the amounts of loads carried by the children (in terms of both absolute mean schoolbag weight and % BW) by grade level, but not by gender. Post hoc tests showed that Grade 8 schoolbags (2.9  0.94 kg, students carried signiÔ¨Åcantly heavier p < 0.01) than Grade 6 (2.5  0.91 kg) students. In contrast, Grade 6 students (7.2  2.47% BW, p < 0.01) carried a signiÔ¨Åcantly greater proportion of body weight than Grade 8 (6.1  1.73% BW) students (Table 1). The majority of children used a backpack to transport items to and from school (72.6% overall, 68.3% boys, 75.1% girls). The remainder of children carried a brief case (13.9%) or satchel (13.5%). The most popular method of carrying a schoolbag was on both shoulders (46.1% overall, 49.7% boys, 43.4% girls), followed by on one shoulder (39.3%) and by hands (14.6%). The mean carrying time  
was 21.5  18.7 min/day (range, 5e120 min). The results of multi- nomial logistic regression showed no statistically signiÔ¨Åcant dif- ferences between boys and girls and between different grade levels in terms of the method of carrying or type of schoolbag. Twice as many children walked to or from school (50.8%) as were driven by car (25.6%) or bus (23.1%). There was also no statistically signiÔ¨Åcant difference in the time spent carrying a schoolbag and mode of transportation to and from the school by gender or grade level. Approximately 97% of children participated in sport activities, with an average of 3.2 h per week. About 58% of children reported that they used a computer for an average of 4.1 h per week. None of the children had access to school lockers. A total of 59.6% of the children reported neck, shoulder or low back complaints during the preceding month. About 55% of the children who reported complaints indicated one location of pain; the remainder (45%) reported more than one location of pain. Neck and shoulder complaints were reported by 35.3% and 26.1% of the students, respectively. Approximately 33% of children reported low back complaints.  The occurrence of neck, shoulder and low back complaints during the preceding month is presented in Table 2. Girls experi- enced neck (OR ¬º 1.94, 95% CI ¬º 1.29e2.91, p < 0.001), shoulder (OR ¬º 1.53, 95% CI ¬º 1.08e2.38, p < 0.05) and low back (OR ¬º 2.16, 95% CI ¬º 1.42e3.29, p < 0.001) complaints more frequently than boys (Table 2). Other demographic factors including age and BMI were not associated with reported complaints. Time spent on sport activities, watching television or using a computer were also not associated with the occurrence of complaints. Table 3 shows the associations between schoolbag carriage variables and the occurrence of complaints in the univariate ana- lyses. The schoolbag weight (expressed as % BW) was associated with the occurrence of neck (OR ¬º 2.10, 95% CI ¬º 1.39e5.30, p < 0.01) and shoulder complaints (OR ¬º 1.69, 95% CI ¬º 1.23e3.41, p < 0.05). Neck complaints were also associated with the time spent carrying a schoolbag each day and method of travelling to or from school (p < 0.05) (Table 2). The type of schoolbag was found to be associated with the occurrence of low back complaints (e.g. children using brief case/satchel had a lower prevalence of back  Table 2 Neck, shoulder and low back complaints according to demographic and individual factors.

(OR ¬º 0.68, complaints than those wearing a backpack) 95% CI ¬º 0.42e0.89, p < 0.05). No other signiÔ¨Åcant differences were found between schoolbag variables and reported complaints. The results of multiple logistic regression analyses are shown in Table 4 in the multivariate context. Gender was found to be a sig- niÔ¨Åcant demographic factor for neck, shoulder and low back com- plaints. The schoolbag weight expressed as % BW was signiÔ¨Åcantly associated with the occurrence of neck and shoulder complaints. SigniÔ¨Åcant association was also found between the time spent carrying a schoolbag each day and neck complaints. The type of schoolbag was the only signiÔ¨Åcant schoolbag variable associated with low back complaints in the multiple regression models.  4. Discussion  Most available data on the occurrence and characteristics of neck, shoulder or back pain in schoolchildren is related to developed and industrialised countries (Jeffries et al., 2007), while there is little information about these issues in developing and low-income countries. The results of the present study add to the understand- ing of the use of schoolbags and musculoskeletal pain in school- children. The main Ô¨Ånding of the study was that the occurrence of low back, neck and shoulder complaints was relatively high in the study population, with girls being more likely to complaint from symptoms in the neck, shoulders and low back than boys. The  schoolbag carriage variables including the mean schoolbag weight expressed as % BW, type of schoolbag, method of carrying a schoolbag and time spent carrying a schoolbag each day were also found to be associated with the occurrence of complaints. It is interesting to note that the mean schoolbag weight in the present study was 2.8 kg that is much lower than weights reported in earlier studies (e.g. ranging from 3.4 kg to 9.4 kg) (Grimmer and Williams, 2000; Negrini and Carabalona, 2002; Jones et al., 2003; Sheir-Neiss et al., 2003; van Gent et al., 2003; Korovessis et al., 2005; WhittÔ¨Åeld et al., 2005; Murphy et al., 2007; Skoffer, 2007). This possibly can be explained by the differences in school curric- ulum, type of books required, school provision of storage, or behavioural and cultural differences between countries. As a consequence, the weight of schoolbags in this study represented 7.1% of the student‚Äôs body weight, which is also lower than those reported in above mentioned studies (range, 10e22% BW). The results of the current study indicated that gender was an independent factor predicting musculoskeletal symptoms in schoolchildren. Among demographic factors, gender was found to be a signiÔ¨Åcant factor for neck, shoulder and low back complaints, so that girls experienced such complaints more frequently than boys. This is similar to the Ô¨Åndings reported by most previous studies which have shown a higher prevalence in girls than in boys (Hakala et al., 2002; van Gent et al., 2003; Siivola et al., 2004; Diepenmaat et al., 2006; Auvinen et al., 2009). The higher preva- lence rate in girls has been attributed to earlier female puberty and its accompanying hormonal changes (Leboeuf-Yde and Kyvik, 1998; Wedderkopp et al., 2005). On the other hand, boys may tend to underreport (Balagu√© et al., 1995) or worry less about their symp- toms (Salminen et al., 1992). In contrast, we found no association between neck, shoulder or low back complaints and other de- mographic factors such as age and BMI. Several studies have shown that the prevalence of neck or shoulder complaints (Hakala et al., 2002; Siivola et al., 2004) and back pain increases with age (Watson et al., 2002; Sato et al., 2008). However, data from the literature on the effect of BMI on neck or shoulder complaints in children and adolescents are limited, and there is some controversy regarding the correlation between back pain and BMI. Some in- vestigators have shown a positive correlation between BMI and back pain (Harreby et al., 1999; Sheir-Neiss et al., 2003; Korovessis et al., 2005), while others have found no association between BMI and back complaints (Grimmer and Williams, 2000; Jones et al., 2003; Masiero et al., 2008).

I. Dianat et al.  / Applied Ergonomics 45 (2014) 437e442  441  As noted earlier, it is not yet clear from the recommended weight limit for carrying schoolbags (e.g. 10%e15% of body weight) whether or not the limit should be set the same for both boys and girls. In this study, there was no signiÔ¨Åcant difference in the amount of loads carried between boys and girls, nor was there a clear difference between genders for the other schoolbag carriage variables. However, the Ô¨Åndings of the present study indicated that girls experienced more neck, shoulder and low back com- plaints than boys. Taken together, these Ô¨Åndings could mean that the recommended weight limit for schoolbag carriage may need to differ between boys and girls. In other words, a single weight limit may not be appropriate for both genders and it may need to be lower for girls than for boys. An alternative approach to developing gender-speciÔ¨Åc guidelines is to consider a more traditional ergo- nomics approach of accommodating a high percentage of the population. For instance, it may be advisable to recommend weight limits based on the lower percentile of the population for the entire population. However, it has been acknowledged that a ‚Äòsafe limit‚Äô for load carriage could not be determined without consideration of individual differences (e.g. variability in body dimensions, physical capabilities, etc.) as well as handling methods (Kroemer, 1997). Moreover, the heterogeneity of the population (in terms of gender) is an important issue that needs to be addressed when using percentiles. Based on the Ô¨Åndings of the present study, it seems therefore more appropriate to develop gender-speciÔ¨Åc guidelines for carrying schoolbags, rather than using a single weight limit. It is also of interest to note that the mean schoolbag weight (expressed as % BW) included in the multiple logistic regression models was found to be associated with the occurrence of neck and shoulder complaints (e.g. those children carried loads greater than 10% of their body weight reported more complaints). This result differs from the Ô¨Åndings reported by van Gent et al. (2003) who found no association between neck/shoulder complaints and the weight of schoolbags. However, the lack of association between low back pain and schoolbag weight in the present study is in accor- dance with most previous studies (Negrini and Carabalona, 2002; van Gent et al., 2003; Korovessis et al., 2005 Skoffer, 2007). Nevertheless, some studies have reported an association between back pain and the weight of schoolbags (Grimmer and Williams, 2000; Sheir-Neiss et al., 2003). The Ô¨Åndings from the current study indicated that longer pe- riods of time spent carrying a schoolbag each day contributed to a greater number of reports of neck complaints. Although some previous studies have shown a positive relationship between time spent carrying schoolbags and reported low back pain (Grimmer and Williams, 2000; Negrini and Carabalona, 2002), we did not Ô¨Ånd such an association. The method of carrying a schoolbag did not contribute to an increased risk for neck, shoulder or low back complaints. However, it seems that carrying a backpack on both shoulders is the optimum method of carrying a schoolbag, as it has been shown that carrying a backpack on one shoulder is likely to be associated with increased risk of back pain (Korovessis et al., 2005; Skoffer, 2007), increased lateral spinal bending and shoulder elevation (Pascoe et al. 1997) and increased electromyographic (EMG) activity of the back muscles (Motmans et al. 2006). More- over, carrying a schoolbag in one hand may be a less efÔ¨Åcient method in terms of energy expenditure as compared with carrying it on both shoulders (Malhotra and Sen Gupta, 1965). Additionally, the type of schoolbag was a signiÔ¨Åcant factor for low back com- plaints (e.g. backpacks were associated with more complaints). Given the limited literature in this area, these Ô¨Åndings provide additional evidence that the relative load (expressed as % BW) may not alone adequately represent the demands on the musculoskel- etal systems of schoolchildren, and therefore other schoolbag  in developing guide-  variables should also be taken into account lines for load carriage by schoolchildren. This study has an advantage that the observer error was controlled by using two trained interviewers in comparison with studies in which there were separate observer for each case (e.g. self-reported or parental-assisted reporting). However, this study was cross-sectional in design, which prevented an evaluation of the relationship between cause and effect, and therefore further lon- gitudinal studies are recommended. In addition, more complex models taking into account other variables (e.g. physical and psy- chological factors) are recommended for the future.  5.  Conclusions  In conclusion, the main Ô¨Ånding of this study was that neck, shoulder and low back pain are frequent in schoolchildren, which is in line with Ô¨Åndings from developed countries. It was shown that gender was an independent factor of musculoskeletal symptoms in schoolchildren. Girls were more likely than boys to suffer from such complaints. The schoolbag weight (expressed as % BW) was found to be associated with the occurrence of neck and shoulder com- plaints. Also, adolescents with neck pain were more likely to carry their schoolbags for a longer period of time each day. The only schoolbag carriage variable associated with low back complaints was the type of schoolbag. These Ô¨Åndings provide further evidence that the mean schoolbag weight expressed as % BW may not be the only determinant of musculoskeletal pain in schoolchildren and recommendations regarding a weight limit for schoolbag carriage should take into account other factors related to the use of schoolbags. The results also suggest that gender differences need to be considered when setting weight limits for schoolchildren.

s0003687013001336,"  Previous work has shown that distal lower extremity joint dysfunction can inÔ¨Çuence peak low-back loading during lifting (Beach et al., 2013). Despite being a logical response to the elimi- nation of biomechanical degrees-of-freedom in a closed kinetic chain task, this Ô¨Ånding provides empirical support for the notion that a general whole-body movement screen could expose personal movement qualities that promote potentially injurious low-back loading patterns at work.

It is therefore conceivable that a tool devised to appraise whole-body movements could be used to project the low-back loading response to lifting. Screen√î (FMS) The Functional Movement is a popular tool proposed to reveal a host of undesirable personal movement attributes (e.g., joint mobility restrictions, bilateral asymmetries, postural control deÔ¨Åcits, and pain-producing movement patterns) (Cook et al., 2006a, b; Cook et al., 2010). Using standardized verbal instructions, testing apparatus, and grading criteria, the ability to move freely, symmetrically, and without pain is appraised via visual inspection of whole-body movement behavior during FMS task performance.

Although FMS scores have not been consistently linked with musculoskeletal injury reporting (Schneiders et al., 2011), there may be beneÔ¨Åt in including the FMS as part of a comprehensive injury prevention and management program for Ô¨ÅreÔ¨Åghters (Butler et al., 2013; Peate et al., 2007). Peate et al. (2007) found that full duty Ô¨ÅreÔ¨Åghters with a musculoskeletal injury history were 1.68 times more likely to ‚Äúfail‚Äù the FMS than were Ô¨ÅreÔ¨Åghters without an injury history; ‚Äúfailing‚Äù was operationally deÔ¨Åned as achieving a composite FMS score of 16 or less (out of 21). This value is higher than the statistically derived cut-point (FMS  14) reported origi- nally based on data from a professional American football team (Kiesel et al., 2007). In support of the statistically-derived cut-point, Butler et al. (2013) found that the probability of missing training time (due to musculoskeletal pain) was greater in Ô¨ÅreÔ¨Åghter re- cruits with FMS < 14 than in those with FMS  14. Scoring 14 or less on the FMS has also been linked with pain and injuries in collegiate athletes (Chorba et al., 2010) and military service personnel (Lisman et al., 2013; O‚ÄôConnor et al., 2011). Given that personal movement constraints can inÔ¨Çuence joint loading throughout the kinetic chain (Beach et al., 2013), a tool such as the FMS may help to identify Ô¨ÅreÔ¨Åghters who are at greater risk of (re-)injuring their low-backs when lifting, a common and costly problem in the Ô¨Åre service (Walton et al., 2003). This study was designed to compare the low-back loading response to lifting between two groups of height- and weight- matched career Ô¨ÅreÔ¨Åghters. FireÔ¨Åghters who scored greater than 14 on the FMS were allocated to the Ô¨Årst group, and size-matched counterparts who scored less than 14 were assigned to the second group. Based on the reasoning outlined above, it was hypothesized that the peak low-back loading response would differ between the high- and low-scorers. In an exploratory analysis performed a posteriori, the data were re-analyzed to examine if performance on individual FMS tasks was related to low-back loading during lifting. It was hypothesized that, with respect to the study purpose, per- formance on individual tasks may be better suited to reveal un- desirable movement attributes than would others.  2. "

In the Ô¨Årst sample (n ¬º 130) analysis revealed no relationship (p ¬º 0.74) between workplace satisfaction and LCEs but lower rates of LCEs were reported by employees In the second sample (n ¬º 112), (IRR 0.52, 95%CI 0.31e0.86) compared to self-employed participants. workplace satisfaction was weakly related to LCEs (IRR 1.04, 95%CI 1.00, to 1.09) with participants who found their job more psychologically demanding more likely to have had an LCE (IRR 1.14, 95%CI 1.05 e1.23). Exploring the role of psychological demands on safety behaviour with respect to quad bike use, may help to address this important safety issue. √ì 2013 Elsevier Ltd and The Ergonomics Society.

Quad bikes are used extensively on New Zealand (NZ) farms for stock work, transport, and towing farm implements (Milosavljevic et al., 2010; Moore, 2007) with an estimated 70 000 to 80 000 in current operation (Carman et al., 2010; Moore, 2007). Use of these vehicles, however, carries some risk of injury. Among NZ rural workers, quad bike incidents cause more than 850 injuries per year and claim an average of Ô¨Åve lives (Department-of-Labour, 2010). The cost to the individual, their family, society and the economy as a whole is considerable. In 2009 NZ‚Äôs nationalised no fault accident insurance scheme, the Accident Compensation Corporation (ACC), outlaid more than NZ$7 million on medical, rehabilitation and workers compensation claims related to quad bike incidents (ACC, 2009). Despite workplace educational interventions from national agencies (Farmsafe, ACC and Department of Labour) the number of reported quad bike injuries and fatalities on NZ farms has not reduced. Recent research identiÔ¨Åed a considerable number of farm quad bike incidents in NZ are unreported (Milosavljevic et al., 2011)  * Corresponding author.

E-mail addresses:  and the true working lifetime prevalence ratesare in excess of 60% (Carman et al., 2010; Milosavljevic et al., 2010). Risk factors asso- ciated with quad bike fatality and injury in NZ include vehicle design (Milosavljevic et al., 2010; Moore, 2007), environmental conditions (Basham et al., 2006; Milosavljevic et al., 2010) and personal factors (Milosavljevic et al., 2011; Shulruf and Balemi, 2010). Risk factors fall into two categories; non-modiÔ¨Åable factors such as farm terrain, weather conditions, the rider‚Äôs height and weight, and modiÔ¨Åable factors such as speed and route. Quad bikes are inherently unstable with a narrow wheel base and a high centre of gravity. There are on-going debates between farmers and man- ufacturers as to the ideal vehicle design with no progress to date. Safe use of quad bikes on farms, therefore, continues to rely to a large extent on rider behaviour. Neal and GrifÔ¨Ån (2004) con- ceptualised workplace safety performance behaviours as being determined by safety knowledge and the motivation to adopt such behaviours, both of which were derived, in part, by an individual‚Äôs attributes (attitude, personality etc). Farmer‚Äôs workplace safety attitudes and behaviours are often posited as a cause of quad bike incidents (Basham et al., 2006; Cryer et al., 2009; Lovelock et al., 2008; Palmer et al., 2009) Organisations responsible for NZ farm health and safety have also hypothesised that personality and social traits in this population make it difÔ¨Åcult to change safety behav- iours (Lovelock et al., 2008; Research NZ, 2007). Research suggests workplace satisfaction can be an antecedent to safety motivation and knowledge (Probst and Brubaker, 2001).

Workplace satisfaction is the ‚Äúoverall affective orientation on the part of individuals work roles which they are presently occu- pying‚Äù (Kalleberg, 1977 p. 126). It is a complex construct that ap- pears to be the composite of psychosocial aspects, speciÔ¨Åc job characteristics and an individual‚Äôs personal factors that form a general like or dislike of the job (Cranny et al., 1992; Kalleberg, 1977; Locke, 1969; Warr, 2007). Global job satisfaction is related to occupational accidents and injury (Dembe et al., 2004; Harkness et al., 2004; Krause et al., 1998; Zontek et al., 2009). More specif- ically, a negative mood, high perceived physical demand, high perceived psychological demand and low co-worker support are associated with occupational accidents (Day et al., 2009; De Jonge et al., 2000; Harkness et al., 2004; Holmberg et al., 2004; Kaplan et al., 2009; Kirkcaldy et al., 1997; Krause et al., 1998; Lovelock et al., 2008; Rodgers and Adler, 2001; Swaen et al., 2004; Trimpop et al., 2000). It is psychometrically optimal to assess workplace satisfaction using multi-item questionnaires, which can be treated as a single factor or broken down to measure speciÔ¨Åc components of the job such as perceived physical or psychological demand, decision latitude, social support and task variety. There is limited existing knowledge of the role of workplace satisfaction in quad bike LCEs and broad models of occupational safety require further testing. The primary aim of this study was to use existing data, from two independent samples, to explore the relationship between work- place satisfaction and prevalence of prior quad bike loss of control events (LCEs). It was predicted that farm workers with lower workplace satisfaction would report more LCEs than those with higher workplace satisfaction scores. The secondary aim was to determine the model of best Ô¨Åt, in each study population, to describe this relationship adjusting for confounding variables.  2. "
s0003687013002202,"  There is a considerable body of shiftwork research that exam- ines the relationships between fatigue, work life conÔ¨Çict, control of shifts and shift type (AHR Committee, 2000; Duxbury, 2003; NCEPH, 2003; Winwood et al., 2006). However, many of these studies are cross-sectional and fail to examine these relationships over time resulting in potentially elevated error risks (Huselid and Becker, 2008). There is also very little research that examines the role of team climate in mitigating the negative impact of shift work (Pisarski et al., 2006). The aim of this study is to examine shift- workers fatigue and the longitudinal relationships that impact on fatigue such as team climate, work life conÔ¨Çict, control of shifts and shift type in hospital based nurses. Most shiftwork researchers consider shiftwork to mean a formal work arrangement that involves at least two teams or shifts relieving each other on a regular basis (Akerstedt et al., 1989). Fa- tigue is generally deÔ¨Åned as a decline in physical and/or mental performance as a result of sleep disturbances, disruption to the biological clock and prolonged exertion often related to complex, monotonous work and actual workload (Moore-Ede, 1995; Williamson et al., 2011). Work life conÔ¨Çict is generally deÔ¨Åned in the literature as occurring when the emotional and behavioural  * Corresponding author.

Barbour).  addresses:  E-mail  demands of work/non-work roles are incompatible, such that participation in one role is made more difÔ¨Åcult by virtue of participation in the other (Pisarski and Loudoun, 2007). Team climate is the atmosphere or dynamics that exist within a team and contains elements of trust, cohesiveness and supportiveness (Adams and Galanes, 2000). Harrington identiÔ¨Åed in a 2001 study that shiftwork involves over 20% of the labour force in developed countries and an even greater percentage in less developed countries (Harrington, 2001). This statistic has not changed, for example, in the United States in 2010, 29% of people work shiftwork (NHISeOHS, 2013) and 16% of Australians were shiftworkers (ABS, 2009). The health and safety of shiftworkers is of vital concern because of the high cost to in- dividuals, organisations and society when these concerns are overlooked (Pisarski and Loudoun, 2007). Managing shiftwork re- quires a thorough understanding of what shiftwork involves, the hazards associated with it, how these risks can minimised, and the control mechanisms monitored. Shiftworker fatigue increases the risks of health effects (Pisarski et al., 2006; Williamson et al., 2011) and the risk of accidents and disasters occurring (Folkard and Lombardi, 2006).  1.1.  Fatigue and shiftwork  It has been well noted that many highly publicised disasters such as Chernobyl, Three Mile Island, Bhopal, Exxon Valdez and the Estonia Ferry disasters occurred in the early hours of the morning.  0003-6870/$ e see front matter √ì 2013 Elsevier Ltd and The Ergonomics Society.

774  A. Pisarski,  J.P. Barbour / Applied Ergonomics 45 (2014) 773e779  Investigations of these disasters concluded that one common contributing factor was human fatigue (Folkard and Lombardi, 2006). More recently, in Queensland, Australia, the investigation into the grounding of the Shen Neng 1 on the Great Barrier Reef in 2010 found that fatigue was a major contributor to the accident (Australian Transport Safety Bureau, 2011). Although it should be noted that there is some confusion about how fatigue is identiÔ¨Åed and measured, studies have found that shiftwork and associated fatigue have a negative effect on perfor- mance, alertness and safety (Dorrian et al., 2011; Williamson et al., 2011; Yuan et al., 2011). Fatigue is an industrial issue, occupational health and safety issue and, at times, an environmental issue. In- dividuals and organisations that fail to manage human fatigue sensibly, risk having or creating injury and error risk with a broad range of damaging and enduring consequences (Williamson et al., 2011). Williamson et al., (2011) for example identiÔ¨Åed two major causes of fatigue, sleep homeostasis factors and the nature of the task such as tasks requiring continuous attention or monotonous tasks linked to safety and performance. Williamson et al. (2011) also identiÔ¨Åed that too few studies have been done on circadian inÔ¨Çuences to strongly suggest their impact on fatigue. In healthcare settings, as many as 25% of shiftworkers complain of chronic fatigue (for example, Costa, 2003; Geiger-Brown, 2011; Hossain et al., 2003). Common complaints centre on inadequate sleep and poor quality sleep. Disrupted or deÔ¨Åcient sleep is often associated with tension, psychological depression, anxiety, psycho- somatic symptoms, persistent fatigue and impaired performance (Shen et al., 2006). Barker and Nussbaum (2011) found that longer shift lengths and increased hours worked per week were associated with higher levels of physical and total fatigue, and also acute and chronic fatigue. In an Australian study of 846 nurses, Winwood et al. (2006) found rotating shiftwork, particularly shifts schedules that included night shifts, was strongly associated with the development of ill health as a result of fatigue. Yuan et al. (2011), in a comparison of nurses who worked only day shifts and those who worked rotating shifts that included regular night shifts, found signiÔ¨Åcantly higher levels of fatigue in the night shift workers. Geiger-Brown et al. (2011) in a study of nurses working 12 h shifts, found adverse work schedules combined with high work demands negatively impact sleep quality and duration leading to increased safety risks. In a follow up study Geiger-Brown et al. (2012) concluded that nurses accrue a signiÔ¨Åcant sleep debt resulting in signiÔ¨Åcant attention lapses. Advances in shiftwork research have also led to a growing awareness of the relationship between work and non-work roles and the impact of conÔ¨Çict between these roles on shiftwork tolerance.  1.2. Work life conÔ¨Çict  Multiple roles can result in increased self-esteem, better health and a more structured life. ConÔ¨Çict between these roles, however, can result in increased stress at home or work, a desynchronisation between work and socially valuable time, negative impacts on health, higher staff turnover and absenteeism, lowered job satis- faction and less organisational commitment (Pisarski et al., 2006; Duxbury, 2003; NCEPH, 2003; Wirtz et al., 2011). Duxbury (2003) found that work/non-work conÔ¨Çict affects workers‚Äô ability to enjoy and nurture their family, resulting in lower levels of family well-being and stability. The interplay between home and work factors and their impact on health was investigated in a study of 140 nurses working shiftwork by Peters et al., 2009. This study found that health variables were explained by work and home characteristics. The results showed that job demands contributed signiÔ¨Åcantly to the health problems of nurses, and those re- spondents who experienced more demands at home reported more general fatigue. In contrast, those who reported more autonomy at  home experienced less emotional exhaustion (Peters et al., 2009). Wirtz et al. (2011) found that working on socially valued days such as Sundays resulted in increased risk of occupational accidents and disrupted work life balance especially social wellbeing and the need to consider these factors when designing work schedules. This literature leads to  Hypothesis 1. There will be a signiÔ¨Åcant positive relationship between work life conÔ¨Çict and fatigue.  1.3.  Roster control  One of the key elements in a supportive climate for shiftworkers is control over their work time such as the design of the shift sys- tem, starting times and the capacity to make adjustments to work rosters to accommodate other responsibilities and interests (Bacon et al., 2005). In a two part study of over 2000 shiftworkers, Bacon et al. (2005) found that those who were happier with their shift pattern saw this as compensation for the hard work required dur- ing a major change process. Nabe-Nielsen et al. (2011a,b), in a study of Danish social and health care workers, analysed the impact of working hours and work time inÔ¨Çuence on psychological well be- ing. The data were collected at three points over a two year period and indicated that shiftworkers with high levels of control over their work times had higher levels of vitality and better mental health than those who worked only days. Conversely, the combi- nation of shiftwork and low work time control was associated with worse psychological well being (Nabe-Nielsen et al., 2011b). Brooks (2000) also argues in support of shift control, suggesting that team based, self-rostering processes for nursing staff are important in improving retention and minimising the negative im- pacts of shiftwork. This lack of roster control has been found to exacerbate physical and psychological ill health and increase sick leave and nurse turnover (Prescott and Bowen, 1987; Silvestro and Silvestro, 2000). A large empirical study of nurse retention in 90 patient care units in the U.S.A. (Prescott and Bowen, 1987) showed that staff scheduling problems is the most frequently cited reason for staff nurse resignations. Silvestro and Silvestro (2000) examined the efÔ¨Åcacy of departmental, team and self-rostering practices in 50 wards in NHS hospitals in the United Kingdom. Their Ô¨Åndings suggest that the choice of rostering system should be contingent upon ward size and rostering system complexity. The implication of this con- tingency approach to rostering is that, as wards grow in size, self- rostering and team rostering become more difÔ¨Åcult, yet a move to departmental rostering can be perceived as retrograde, with staff relinquishing control (Silvestro and Silvestro, 2000). Bailyn et al. (2007) found that control over rosters can have positive results for nurses and beneÔ¨Åt the nurse manager, providing nurses see this as not an individual entitlement but rather as a balance between indi- vidual and unit beneÔ¨Åt. Nabe-Nielsen et al. (2011c) investigated the impact of Ô¨Çexibility, variability, regularity and predictability of working hours on shift workers in aged care settings. They found that workers inÔ¨Çuence over their shift schedules buffered the adverse effects of shift work and assisted individuals to have more control. Interestingly, however, this increased control over their individual shifts by staff decreased continuity of care for their aged patients and co-operation with colleagues (Nabe-Nielsen et al., 2011c). Control over rosters is a complex issue, and while it appears that control may alleviate fatigue, reduce sick leave and turnover, for individual shiftworkers its implementation may be problematic for continuity of care for patients and potentially create issues at the team level. This leads to  Hypothesis 2. There will be a signiÔ¨Åcant negative relationship between roster control and fatigue.  
A. Pisarski,  J.P. Barbour / Applied Ergonomics 45 (2014) 773e779  775  1.4.  Team climate  What the self-rostering research suggests is that in order for control over rosters to be effective, nurses need to take a team view where everyone beneÔ¨Åts, rather than an individual view. This process, of course, requires an understanding of the impact of team climate on nurses‚Äô fatigue, wellbeing and patient outcomes. For effective nursing, nurses need an ability to work as members of a team in a positive work climate (CiofÔ¨Å and Ferguson, 2009; Pisarski et al., 2006). In a recent cross-sectional study, for example, nurses who perceived that they had high levels of supervisor support were found to appraise their work team climate more positively (Pisarski et al., 2006). Creating a positive team climate and giving shift- workers more control over their work environment reduced time- based work life conÔ¨Çict and physical symptoms (Pisarski et al., 2006). CiofÔ¨Å and Ferguson (2009) found team based nursing had positive patient outcomes and increased staff mentoring but a better understanding of gaining team satisfaction is needed. This leads to the following hypotheses:  Hypothesis 3. There will be a signiÔ¨Åcant negative relationship between a positive team climate and fatigue.  1.5. The impact of shift type on fatigue, roster control, team climate and work life conÔ¨Çict  If we combine scant current knowledge based on the work of researchers such as CiofÔ¨Å and Ferguson (2009); Nabe-Nielsen et al. (2012); Pisarski et al. (2006) it suggests discussions with teams and the quality of those interactions expressed by team climate may play a role in alleviating fatigue and work life conÔ¨Çict and assist in improving work life balance. There is a gap in research evidence about the difference of the team climate experienced by people working three shifts which include night shifts where there may be fewer staff on duty. One study by Felicetti (1990) for example, found that night workers felt a strong sense of social isolation from col- leagues. This sense of isolation may lead to three shift workers having a different perception of their team climate from those on day shifts. If this is the case we might expect night shift workers to experience greater levels of fatigue, work life conÔ¨Çict and desychronisation from a normal social environment. This leads to the following hypotheses:  Hypothesis 4. The negative relationship between positive team climate and fatigue will be moderated by shift type, such that this relationship will be stronger for two-shift workers (day shifts) than shiftwork that includes regular rotating night shifts (three-shift workers).  Hypothesis 5. The negative relationship between roster control and fatigue will be moderated by shift type, such that this rela- tionship will be stronger for shiftwork that includes regular rotating night shifts than those working day shifts.  Hypothesis 6. The positive relationship between work life conÔ¨Çict and fatigue will be moderated by shift type, such that this rela- tionship will be stronger for shiftwork that includes regular rotating night shifts than those that work only day shifts.  2.

An envelope, addressed to a central place in the hospital, was provided for respondents to seal and mail their anonymous and conÔ¨Ådential questionnaires. This time interval was negotiated with the hospital‚Äôs executive nurse manager as being the most suitable for the hospital. All survey measures were collected at both time points. Participants con- structed an identity code used at both time periods. Completed questionnaires were returned by 931 nurses at Time 1 (51% response rate) and 679 nurses at Time 2 (42% response rate). Matching participants across surveys resulted in a Ô¨Ånal matched sample of 166 nurses. Of these 166 nurses, 61 worked two shift rotating rosters (8 h morning and afternoon/evening shifts) and 105 were three shift rotating shiftworkers who worked 8 h day, evening and night shifts. In the Ô¨Ånal sample, 91% were female. The median age was 30e 40 years, with most respondents under 40 years of age (67%). The majority of respondents were in a relationship (63%) and had no dependent children (65%). Almost all were permanent employees of the hospital (96%) and most worked full time hours (62%). The median organisational tenure was 6e10 years, with 76% of re- spondents having worked for the hospital for less than 10 years. By shift type, 37% of respondents worked two-shift rotating day shifts and 63% worked three-shift rotating rosters that included regular night shifts. Comparison to available organisational data indicated that the Ô¨Ånal sample demographics closely matched those of nurses in the sample organisation, and thus the sample was deemed representative. A comparison of the demographic and job characteristics of two- and three-shift workers at Time 1 is presented in Table 1. Chi-  
776  A. Pisarski,  J.P. Barbour / Applied Ergonomics 45 (2014) 773e779  square tests were used to determine whether the demographic and job characteristics of two- and three-shift workers were signiÔ¨Å- cantly different. These tests revealed that two-shift and three-shift workers differed signiÔ¨Åcantly by average age (two-shift workers older), relationship status (more two-shift workers in a relation- ship), organisational tenure (two-shift workers longer tenure), and percent with managerial responsibilities (more two-shift workers managers). These signiÔ¨Åcant demographic and job characteristic differences were included in our analyses as control variables. These control variables were chosen as there is research evidence that suggests these demographics and job characteristics may impact the fatigue, wellbeing, and work life balance of shift work- ing nurses with more negative outcomes for those working three shifts. Two- and three-shift workers in this sample however, did not differ signiÔ¨Åcantly by gender, hours worked, employment sta- tus or dependent children which allowed us to examine the vari- ables of interest free from the potential impact of these potential biases.  2.2. Measures  Team climate was measured by 10 items adapted from the Pisarski et al. (2006) dimensions of team climate scale, and demonstrated good internal consistency across both time points (Time 1 a ¬º .85; Time 2 a ¬º .81). This scale measures perceptions of team characteristics such as giving feedback, trust and collabora- tion within the team, understanding the objectives of the team, and the team‚Äôs impact on individual performance and is measured on a  5-point scale (1 ¬º strongly disagree, 5 ¬º strongly agree).  Control over shift allocations was measured by 2 items adapted from Pisarski and Bohle (2001) measured on a 5-point scale  (1 ¬º strongly disagree, 5 ¬º strongly agree). A sample item is ‚ÄúI have  enough input and control over rosters‚Äù. The scale demonstrated acceptable internal consistency in both surveys (Time 1 a ¬º .87; Time 2 a ¬º .89). Work-life conÔ¨Çict was measured by 6 items devised by Bohle and Tilley (1998). The scale examines conÔ¨Çict between the de- mands of an individual‚Äôs job and the demands of the individual‚Äôs family and friendship networks and is measured on a 5-point scale  (1 ¬º strongly disagree, 5 ¬º strongly agree). This scale achieved a  (Time 1  across both time points  satisfactory Cronbach‚Äôs alpha a ¬º .87; Time 2 a ¬º .87). (1 ¬º almost never, 5 ¬º almost always) from the Standard Shiftwork Fatigue was measured by 2 items measured on a 5-point scale Index (SSI); (Barton et al., 1995). In this study, the fatigue items demonstrated high internal consistency across both surveys (Time 1 a ¬º .83; Time 2 a ¬º .82). The control variables of age, relationships status, organisational tenure and managerial status were included as control variables. Relationship status (0 ¬º single, 1 ¬º in a relationship) and managerial status (0 ¬º not manager, 1 ¬º manager) were both dummy coded. The proposed moderating variable of shift type (dummy coded as  1 ¬º day shift, 1 ¬º night shift) was also included.  2.3. Missing data and analytical strategy  Due to the relatively small number of matched surveys over time, we conducted analyses to determine whether there were any systematic differences between nurses who responded to both surveys (matched respondents) and those who only responded to the Ô¨Årst survey (unmatched respondents). A MANOVA found no signiÔ¨Åcant main effect of survey completion on the main study variables. Chi-square tests found no signiÔ¨Åcant differences between matched and unmatched respondents on shift type, organisational tenure, managerial status, relationship status, or age. This suggests  that systematic differences between our matched and unmatched respondents are unlikely to provide an alternative explanation for our results. We used moderated hierarchical multiple regression to test our hypotheses. Following Aiken and West (1991), we mean centred our independent variables and used these centred variables to create interaction terms with shift type. In line with recommen- dations, shift type was dummy coded as  1 ¬º day shift, 1 ¬º night shift before creating these interaction terms. Independent variables were introduced into the regression equation in three steps. In Step 1, fatigue at Time 1 was entered as a control variable, along with the job and demographic characteristics of manager status (dummy coded as 1 ¬º manager), organisational tenure, age, and relationship (dummy coded as 1 ¬º in a status relationship). The proposed moderating variable, shift type (dummy coded as 1 ¬º night shift), was also entered at the Ô¨Årst step. At Step 2, the centred values of the three hypothesised predictors of team climate, roster control and work life conÔ¨Çict were entered. In the third step, the two-way interaction terms between shift type and the three independent variables were entered. At each step, the change in variance explained and signiÔ¨Åcance of individual beta coefÔ¨Åcients was inspected.  3. Results  3.1. Descriptive statistics  The means, standard deviations and intercorrelations between main study variables are presented in Table 2. All three indepen- dent variables were signiÔ¨Åcantly correlated with reported levels of fatigue 18 months later, and these correlations were all in the ex- pected directions e team climate (r ¬º  .20, p ¬º .01), roster control (r ¬º  .24, p ¬º .001) and work life conÔ¨Çict (r ¬º .27, p < .001).  3.2.  Regression analyses  The results of our regression analysis are presented in Table 3. At Step 1, the variables collectively explained 27.2% of the variance in (6,159) ¬º 9.88, p < .001). Prior fatigue (F levels of fatigue (as measured 18 months earlier) was a signiÔ¨Åcant predictor of current fatigue (b ¬º .43, p < .001). Age also emerged as a signiÔ¨Åcant pre- dictor (b ¬º  .21, p ¬º .01), such that younger nurses reported higher levels of fatigue. However, none of the other demographic and job characteristics, including shift type (b ¬º .02, ns), were signiÔ¨Åcant as predictors of fatigue. Based on previous cross-sectional research Ô¨Åndings, Hypotheses 1, 2 and 3 predicted that team climate, roster control and work life conÔ¨Çict would be signiÔ¨Åcant predictors of fatigue over time. At Step 2, the addition of these three independent variables explained an additional 4.2% of the variance in fatigue (DF (3, 156) ¬º 3.17, p ¬º .03). However, of these three predictors, only roster control was signif- icant as a predictor of fatigue over time (b ¬º  .18, p ¬º .03), such that having less control over roster scheduling predicted signiÔ¨Åcantly higher fatigue 18 months later. Therefore, while Hypothesis 2 was supported, Hypothesis 1 and Hypothesis 3 were not. Hypotheses 4, 5 and 6 predicted that shift type would moderate the relationships between team climate (H4), roster control (H5), work life conÔ¨Çict (H6) and fatigue, such that the relationship be- tween team climate and fatigue would be stronger for nurses working two- shifts, while the relationships between roster control, work life conÔ¨Çict and fatigue would be stronger for nurses working three-shifts which included night shifts. In the third step, the addition of the interaction terms explained an additional 2.3% of the variance in fatigue. While this change was not a statistically signiÔ¨Åcant improvement to the model (DF (3, 153) ¬º 1.74, ns), this is

We therefore inspected the signiÔ¨Åcance of the individual interaction terms. Only the interaction term between shift type and team climate was (b ¬º .16, p ¬º .04). Simple slopes analysis was used to signiÔ¨Åcant probe the signiÔ¨Åcant interaction between team climate and shift type. In support of Hypothesis 4, team climate predicted fatigue for day-shift workers (b ¬º  .36, t ¬º  2.20, p ¬º .03), such that two-shift working nurses who reported a more positive team climate re- ported signiÔ¨Åcantly lower fatigue 18 months later. However, the relationship between team climate and fatigue was not signiÔ¨Åcant for night-shift workers (b ¬º .13, t ¬º .78, p ¬º .44). This interaction is presented in Fig. 1. Neither Hypothesis 5 nor Hypothesis 6 was supported.  4. Discussion and conclusion  The study aimed to examine the longitudinal relationships be- tween fatigue, team climate, work life conÔ¨Çict, control of shifts and shift type. This study found that fatigue, roster control, shift type and team climate are very real but complex issues for shiftworking nurses. Shiftwork has profound effects on the health, well being and safety of workers, and therefore it is critical that these effects are examined using longitudinal designs. In longitudinal analyses, by identifying those observations that are measured on the same individuals, it is possible to focus on changes occurring within in- dividuals and to make sample inferences that are not as sensitive to between subject variations. In this study, we found that only two of the proposed six hy- potheses were supported. For example, contrary to expectations, especially given previous cross-sectional research Ô¨Åndings (Pisarski and Loudoun, 2007), work life conÔ¨Çict was not a signiÔ¨Åcant pre- dictor of fatigue over time. There was no signiÔ¨Åcant positive rela- tionship between work life conÔ¨Çict and fatigue as predicted in Hypothesis 1. The expected positive longitudinal relationship be- tween work life conÔ¨Çict and fatigue was also not moderated by shift type, such that this relationship was not stronger for three-shift workers than two-shift workers as predicted in Hypothesis 6. At both Time 1 and Time 2, however, the strongest correlation was with work life conÔ¨Çict. So, at any point in time, work life conÔ¨Çict was the strongest predictor of concurrent fatigue, but over time it was not. So it could be that similar to age and fatigue, a survivor effect operates, whereby there is a critical point at which an in- dividual‚Äôs tolerance is exceeded and they respond to their high work life conÔ¨Çict and fatigue by changing some aspect of their work or life in order to create a more tolerable situation again. The fact that over just an 18 month period we could only Ô¨Ånd 166 matched participants from a sample of over 670 nurses may be an indicator  of this survivor effect in operation. Unfortunately as surveys were anonymous we can only speculate whether the small matched sample is due to turnover, selection or some other mechanism. There were no major structural, strategy or cultural changes introduced in this hospital over this 18 month period that might provide more insight. Future research would need to consider trajectories of work life conÔ¨Çict and fatigue over time on larger matched samples to more fully investigate this issue. The role that fatigue plays in both nurse and patient safety and, more broadly, in disaster management, makes it imperative that fatigue is examined longitudinally. As previously stated, when workers are fatigued they have difÔ¨Åculty concentrating, they are less alert, and reaction times are slower resulting in increased risk of error, accident or injury (Barker and Nussbaum, 2011; Fransen et al., 2006). This study found a signiÔ¨Åcant negative relationship between roster control and fatigue supporting Hypothesis 2. For these 166 shiftworkers, fatigue increased over time when there was a lack of control over rosters. It supports the work of Pisarski et al. (2006) that found a relationship between control over work envi- ronments (including rosters) and physical health, and extends it to fatigue and a speciÔ¨Åc form of control, namely, control over rosters. The negative relationship between roster control and fatigue was not moderated by shift type (Hypothesis 5), such that this rela- tionship was not stronger for shifts that include regular night shifts (3-shifts) as opposed to those working only day shifts (2-shifts). The lack of signiÔ¨Åcant interaction between roster control and shift type suggests that control over shift scheduling can have signiÔ¨Åcant effects on fatigue for both two-shift and three-shift workers. Although not found in this study the research of Yuan et al. (2011) and Geiger-Brown et al. (2011) suggests rotating three shift workers with a lack of roster control should have greater fatigue than two shift workers and suggests the need for further investigation, especially in relation to the role of team climate. Interestingly, there was also no signiÔ¨Åcant negative relationship between a positive team climate and fatigue over time generally as predicted in Hypothesis 3. However, we did Ô¨Ånd a signiÔ¨Åcant negative relationship between positive team climate and fatigue moderated by shift type, such that this relationship was stronger for two-shift workers than three-shift workers as predicted in Hypothesis 4. This would indicate that a positive team climate re- duces the level of fatigue for nurses working rotating day shifts but does not reduce fatigue for those on rotating shifts that include regular night shifts. Overall, the results suggest that fatigue in nurses can be reduced by having more control over rosters, and that a positive team climate will also further reduce fatigue for two-shift workers but does not mitigate fatigue for those working three shifts. This study, although longitudinal, did not examine effects at the team level, that is a measure of teams longitudinally and these

Given the beneÔ¨Åts of reduced fatigue, but also the issue of self interest interfering with effective self rostering, identiÔ¨Åed by Bailyn et al. (2007), our results indicate the importance of fostering a positive team climate for both two-shift workers and three shift workers. The fact that we did not Ô¨Ånd this relationship for those working three shifts warrants further investigation to ascertain whether working regular night shifts, as in the case with these workers, results in an accumulated sleep debt that cannot be mitigated or whether it is simply more difÔ¨Åcult to build positive team climates and reduce three shift workers feelings of isolation, not just socially but from co-workers as well. Fostering a positive team climate should not detract from a consideration of individual needs and should enhance the will- ingness of staff to consider the needs of the team or ward members. This should, in turn, improve compliance with the underlying assumption of self-rostering that it should beneÔ¨Åt both the indi- vidual nurse as well as the team as can be inferred from the work of CiofÔ¨Å and Ferguson (2009); Nabe-Nielsen et al. (2012) and Pisarski et al. (2006). For shift workers rotating between day and night shifts, control of rosters appears more important than team climate for reducing fatigue but warrants further investigation.  3.5  3.0  2.5  2.0  1.5  1.0  Day shift Night shift  )  2  T  (  e  u g  i  t  a  F  Low  High  Team Climate (T1)  Fig. 1.

This study also demon- strates the beneÔ¨Åts of longitudinal studies; however, one limitation of this research is sample size. Longitudinal research is best suited to large stable populations. The results demonstrate that the par- ticipants at this hospital were not stable over the 18 month period of study with only 166 people completing both the Time 1 and Time 2 surveys out of a possible sample of more than 670 participants, suggesting that nurse turnover, selection or some other mechanism may have been an issue in sampling longitudinally. This has im- plications for data collection, the method of analysis that can be utilised and the suitability of the industry. The recommendations for minimum sample size suggested it was inappropriate to use structural equation modelling for the present analyses (Kline, 2011). However, future research should aim to overcome limita- tions by collecting larger, non-self report, samples from more stable populations, over more time periods to enable theoretical models regarding shift work tolerance to be tested over time using cross- lagged panel designs.  "
s0003687013002706,"  In the near future it will be necessary and expected, as well as possible to better support the driver in driving more safely, envi- ronmentally friendly, efÔ¨Åciently (cost and time) and legally, through new technology such as displays, sensor and connectivity (Davidsson et al., 2009). One of the most important and best available ways of doing this is probably to provide the driver with appropriate information. An additional purpose of driver information is to support emotional aspects (comfort, perceived control, fun etc.) (Davidsson et al., 2009), meaning that some of the functions in the vehicle exist also or just because drivers perceive a need or desire for them. They may Ô¨Ånd that the function is not needed for rational reasons but that it is ‚Äúenjoyable‚Äù or ‚Äúfun‚Äù or perhaps because ‚Äúit used to be there‚Äù. The real ‚Äúneed‚Äù of information may be most easily found in driver models such as the strategic, tactical and operational level of control model by Michon (1985), the SRK taxonomy by Rasmussen (1986) or collected from experts such as human factor experts, crash statisticians, safety analysts, green driving or engine experts. However, if a function is given low priority because it is not really needed from an expert point of view, the design or functionality  * Corresponding author. E-mail address: hosianna1967@gmail.com (S. Davidsson).  may be experienced as poor. Furthermore, a function perceived as un-needed but that, from an expert‚Äôs viewpoint, is important may require more design effort to motivate it. These purposes, technology push and the fact that future cars have access to a huge amount of information gathered by car to car (C2C) or car to infrastructure (C2I) can, if not designed in a careful manner, result in a functional growth that may reach beyond drivers‚Äô capability. Showing all the information simultaneously would probably create distraction and inattention and make driving less safe, less environ- mentally friendly and so on because of visual, manual or cognitive distraction. (For a deÔ¨Ånition, see for instance Regan et al., 2009.) One of the problems with previous and most of the current driver information system hardware is that it is inÔ¨Çexible. However, new display technology has enabled adaptability (and Ô¨Çexibility), and it may therefore be possible to better adapt to drivers‚Äô needs and desires. Alfredson (2007) suggests that ideal system development should include a dynamic adaptation of interfaces to different input factors, such as current vehicle status, situational conditions and contextual prerequisites as well as the individual‚Äôs status, operator performance and historical behavioural data. For instance, a tired driver and an alert driver, a daily trip to work and a holiday trip, a worn car and a new car and drivers with long and short response times may need different information. This dynamic adaptation may either be performed automatically by a dialogue manager with an increased risk for automation induced errors such as mode  0003-6870/$ e see front matter √ì 2014 Elsevier Ltd and The Ergonomics Society.

Alm / Applied Ergonomics 45 (2014) 994e1002  995  confusion and increased mental workload, or manually through interaction with the system with an increased risk for visual and manual distraction (Davidsson, 2009). The scope of this study was therefore to take a Ô¨Årst step towards dynamic adaptation by studying if and how different contexts require different information. For instance, how needed or wanted is a speedometer when the car is parked in a garage? A natural starting point is therefore to study how context can govern driver information functions. Another issue is of course the level of consensus among drivers about what information should be available and when it should be available. The purpose of this study was therefore to investigate:   whether drivers want or have a perceived need for different  what functions in different contexts (Q1), information different drivers perceive to be needed and wanted in different contexts (Q2),  the extent to which there is consensus about each function (Q3)  And to illustrate and make understandable the functions in the different contexts (Q4).  2. Method  2.1. Approach  The study was a combination of an interview and a rating of functions. The purpose of the interview was to try to make the participants think beyond today‚Äôs design of cars and to gather data for an understanding about how people think in different contexts. The numerical data in this study were not used for signiÔ¨Åcance testing but rather for the purpose of analysing the function‚Äôs levels of importance and level of consensus among car drivers. The reason for this approach was that, when working with future functionality, it is necessary to have an understanding of how people think, rather than studying only what functionality they have today or what the functionality currently does. The intention of the numerical data was instead, in conjunction with the interview, to form an answer to the research questions.  2.2.  Participants  Thirty-three Swedish private car drivers, 14 men and 19 women, participated. The participants were on average 42 years old; the minimum age was 20 and maximum age 69. The drivers‚Äô experi- ence spanned between the categories of beginners to experienced drivers (Michon, 1993), and they were recruited in the Gothenburg region of Sweden. The different contexts and functions were decided in a group discussion by Ô¨Åve Safety and Human Machine Interaction (HMI) experts at Volvo Car Corporation and Lule√• University of Technol- ogy. The experts were also used when developing the Context Function Matrix (CFM), heavily inspired by the Context Activity Template (CAT) by Naikar et al. (2005) (see Appendix 1). The CAT is included in the second level in Cognitive Work Analysis (CWA) (see for instance Vicente, 1999), which is called Activity Analysis.  2.3. Driving contexts  The criteria for grouping contexts were threefold. First, the context groups should be easily distinguished from each other. Second, they should cover a whole ‚Äútypical‚Äù trip from door to door. Third, they should offer some kind of information needed in the context to sup- port the purposes mentioned in the objectives (not only safety). The following context groups were established (a context group has different locations but similar road type).   Before/After: Before/going to/entering the car/post driving.  Car parking: When parked, in a car park or in a garage, looking for a parking place.  City crossing: Intersection, trafÔ¨Åc light,  Highway crossings: Intersection, red light, left turn across path, straight crossing path, roundabout. straight crossing path, roundabout.  Straight highway driving: Drifting, tiating a curve.  Queue: Driving in a queue.  lane change merge, nego-  left  turn across path,  2.4. Apparatus  Nine pictures (3  3 matrix) illustrating one context group were displayed on a paperboard. Among the different participants, the pictures were randomly mixed on the board to avoid order effects. The pictures showed different viewing angles such as from inside the car and a bird‚Äôs eye view. See Fig. 1. The contexts ‚Äúqueue‚Äù and ‚Äúbefore/after‚Äù driving were found difÔ¨Åcult to illustrate by pictures. Instead, written text was used.  2.5.  Simulation interview  A simulation interview was conducted, inspired by the Applied Cognitive Task Analysis (ACTA) method (Militello and Hutton, 1998). The simulation interview is a walkthrough, a mental simu- lation, of driving in or through the speciÔ¨Åc context, after which the participants are asked to think of what they do, how they do it, what they Ô¨Ånd difÔ¨Åcult and what they feel. The interview was not biased towards safety or green driving or any other attribute. Most of the participants were interviewed in two contexts but some in only one, due to time constraints. There were ten participants in each of the six contexts, which gave a total of 60 interviews. The duration of each interview was in general between half an hour and 1 h.  2.6.  Representation of  functions  Davidsson et al. (2009) decomposed the functional purpose of driving information by using the Ô¨Årst step in Cognitive Work Analysis (CWA) called Work Domain Analysis (WDA) described in for instance Vicente (1999). This decomposition was used to deÔ¨Åne the functions, and the second lowest level of abstraction, called functions can be found  function, was used.

In addition, a ‚Äúwaste bin‚Äù was provided for functions not applicable, inappropriate or considered dangerous.  2.8.

On the straight highway, the driver again found the information less important (M ¬º 2.7, SD ¬º 1.1, W ¬º 10%). If the driver ended up in a queue, the grading increased somewhat again (M ¬º 3.1, SD ¬º 1.4, W ¬º 10%). From the notes taken, it is understood that the driver wants to solve the queue problem by Ô¨Ånding another route to the destination. At the city (M ¬º 3.8, crossing, drivers again found this information useful SD ¬º 1.2, W ¬º 0%), as in the case of the highway crossing. The grades (M ¬º 3.2, SD ¬º 1.4, W ¬º 28) for all contexts for this particular function reveal nothing more than that it is rather useful for these particular contexts since the contexts are not weighted and all possible contexts are not included in the results. However, if the standard deviation was lower, such as in the case with the function ‚ÄúShow that there are queues on the way to the destina- tion‚Äù (M ¬º 4.0, SD ¬º 1.0, W ¬º 10%), it could be interpreted that the function is useful in more or less all contexts. These are a few examples, but the way of analysing a function may be the same for all.  3.2.1.  Before and after driving  Before driving, functions of a more strategic character are graded high: ‚Äúwarn for slippery road conditions‚Äù, ‚Äúshow outdoor tempera- ture‚Äù, ‚Äúwarn for slippery road conditions on the way to the destination‚Äù, ‚Äúshow fuel level‚Äù, ‚Äúshow distance to empty tank‚Äù, ‚Äúshow alternative roads to the destination‚Äù, ‚Äúshow information about dangerous roads‚Äù, ‚Äúshow estimated time of arrival‚Äù, ‚Äúshow that there are queues on the way to the destination‚Äù, ‚Äúshow recommended speed due to road conditions, visibility‚Äù and ‚Äúshow tire pressure in the different tires‚Äù. However, the consensus is low for many of the functions. For instance, ‚Äúshow recommended speed due to road conditions‚Äù was graded to be important, although three out of ten participants stated that they did not want the function at all (M ¬º 4.2, SD ¬º 0.4, W ¬º 50%). On the other hand, functions such as ‚Äúshow coming trafÔ¨Åc signs‚Äù, ‚Äúshow that you are unintentionally changing lane‚Äù, ‚Äúwarn if the car enters a curve at too high a speed‚Äù, ‚Äúshow if there is a trafÔ¨Åc light soon‚Äù, ‚Äúshow other cars in an intersection‚Äù, ‚Äúshow when it is permitted to take over‚Äù, ‚Äúshow road grip in relation to how much you turn‚Äù are rated very low with a high consensus. These are mainly tactical and operational, which is of course of less use in this context. The open end answers such as ‚Äúbefore long trips‚Äù, ‚Äúwhen planning a trip‚Äù, ‚Äúplan when to Ô¨Åll up the tank‚Äù, ‚Äúplan when to eat‚Äù and ‚Äúbefore you go‚Äù together with the grading reveal that this is information that is used for strategic decisions and long term planning. In some cases, the comments also deal with feedback from the car, for instance ‚Äúcompare how fast you drove at permitted speed‚Äù or ‚Äúgood to have statistics afterwards‚Äù.  3.2.2.  Car parking  In the case of parking, information close to the vehicle is more interesting to the driver. Functions such as ‚Äúshow a top view of the  car and its close proximity‚Äù, ‚Äúshow free parking places‚Äù and ‚Äúshow near view behind the car‚Äù are among the top grades. These func- tions can be considered tactical and/or operational. There is consensus about the Ô¨Årst two functions mentioned above. How- ever, the latter show a lower consensus. Some mentioned that they ‚Äúwanted to see for themselves‚Äù, which may explain why they did not want information from the car. Interestingly, speed came in 26th place, although with a low consensus. ‚ÄúLap time‚Äù, ‚Äúshow cruise control set speed‚Äù, ‚Äúability to watch movie‚Äù, ‚Äúshow when it is permitted to take over‚Äù, ‚Äúshow engine oil temperature‚Äù and ‚Äúshow average speed‚Äù were given the lowest scores but had a high consensus. Open end comments such as ‚Äúimportant to see what the time is‚Äù, ‚Äúplan the trip‚Äù and ‚Äúplan for slippery road conditions‚Äù indicate that the functions should primarily be useful before strategic decisions. Together with the high grades described above, this shows that the most important information is both strategic and operational.  3.2.3. Highway crossing  In a highway intersection, the drivers want and need functions such as ‚Äúshow if there are cars in the blind spot‚Äù, ‚Äúwarn for slippery road conditions‚Äù, ‚Äúimprove night vision‚Äù, ‚Äúwarn if the car enters a curve at too high a speed‚Äù, ‚Äúshow where the roads are heading in the next intersection‚Äù, ‚Äúshow recommended speed due to road conditions, visibility etc.‚Äù, ‚Äúinform that you are driving too close to the vehicle ahead‚Äù, ‚Äúshow what the next intersection looks like‚Äù and ‚Äúshow alternative roads to the destination‚Äù. It seems that the driver needs and wants information on all three levels when approaching an intersection. There was high consensus among the participants about which information is useful and desired. ‚ÄúAbility to surf on the Internet‚Äù, ‚Äúshow free parking places‚Äù, ‚Äúshow engine oil temperature‚Äù, ‚Äúshow engine oil pressure‚Äù, ‚Äúlap time‚Äù, ‚Äúshow start time for parking heater‚Äù and ‚Äúremind that the car needs regular service‚Äù received the lowest grades. As among the top graded functions, there is a consensus that these functions are of less use when driving in intersections. ‚ÄúStressful to Ô¨Ånd the right way‚Äù, ‚ÄúGreat, this is where accidents happen‚Äù and ‚ÄúAffect my speed‚Äù indicate that the information needed is of a more tactical character than for parking and for before and after driving.  3.2.4.  Straight highway driving  The functions are mainly strategic or tactical. ‚ÄúShow speed‚Äù was given the highest grade. Functions such as ‚Äúwarn for slippery road conditions‚Äù, ‚Äúimprove night vision‚Äù, ‚Äúshow fuel level‚Äù, ‚Äúwarn for slippery road conditions on the way to the destination‚Äù, ‚Äúwarn for being distracted (e.g. looking away for a long time)‚Äù, ‚Äúshow alter- native roads to the destination (in the case of queues or accidents)‚Äù and ‚Äúshow recommended speed due to road conditions, visibility etc.‚Äù were also given a high grade. There was high consensus among the drivers that these functions are important.

The dotted line describes the context in which the function may be acceptable to have and the circle the ‚ÄúStandard Deviation bars‚Äù in which context the information is needed or wanted.  The lowest rankings were given to ‚Äúshow engine oil tempera- ture‚Äù, ‚Äúlearn the car‚Äôs different functions and systems‚Äù, ‚Äúshow start time for parking heater‚Äù, ‚Äúshow how fast the car accelerates‚Äù, ‚Äúability to watch movie‚Äù and ‚Äúability to play games‚Äù. The consensus for these functions was also rather high.  3.2.5. Queue  A queue is different from the other contexts. It could perhaps better be described as a situational condition rather than a context. Nevertheless, the most important functions while driving in a queue are: ‚Äúshow alternative roads to the destination‚Äù, ‚Äúshow that there are queues on the way to the destination‚Äù, ‚Äúshow that an accident has occurred on the way to the destination‚Äù, ‚Äúshow a map of where you are‚Äù, ‚Äúshow the current time‚Äù and ‚Äúshow where the roads are heading in the next intersection‚Äù. It seems that the drivers need strategic in- formation and support in order to solve the problem themselves. Interestingly, functions such as ‚Äúability to play game‚Äù, ‚Äúability to surf on the Internet‚Äù or ‚Äúability to watch a movie‚Äù were rated rather high. However, there were high standard deviations, which in- dicates low consensus. The functions that were graded lowest were mainly related to speed, which gives information about something that the driver in fact lacks. These were functions such as ‚Äúwarn if the car enters a curve at too high a speed‚Äù, ‚Äúshow how fast or slow you have to drive to get a green light‚Äù, ‚Äúshow information about speed cameras‚Äù, ‚Äúshow cruise control set speed‚Äù and ‚Äúshow how fast the car accel- erates‚Äù. Speedometer came in 24th place. ‚ÄúSomething to entertain myself with‚Äù, ‚Äúat least something to do‚Äù and ‚Äúsomething to play with‚Äù show that drivers can accept some functions that they normally would not.  3.2.6.  City crossing  Show if there are cars in the blind spot‚Äù, ‚Äúimprove night vision‚Äù, ‚Äúshow alternative roads to the destination‚Äù, ‚Äúshow that an accident has occurred on the way to the destination‚Äù, ‚Äúshow that you are  driving close to a school‚Äù, ‚Äúhelp recognize other nearby vehicles‚Äù and ‚Äúwarn for slippery road conditions‚Äù were functions that received high grades. Similar to the case of highway intersections, the consensus on the functions is high. There was a high consensus about the lowest grades: ‚Äúshow engine coolant temperature‚Äù, ‚Äúshow oil level in engine‚Äù, ‚Äúshow engine oil temperature‚Äù, ‚Äúmeasure time‚Äù, ‚Äúshow travel distance in total‚Äù and ‚Äúshow engine oil pressure‚Äù.  3.2.7. Notes  Notes were taken during the grading. These notes help to explain why the participants gave the grade they did and the preferred source of the information: car, driver, road authority etc. The notes can be acquired from the author upon request. However, a few examples are provided below. Example: Function/Context: ‚ÄúNote‚Äù   Show fuel level/Before and after: ‚ÄúIf you have to leave earlier, for planning‚Äù  Show that you are close to a school/Straight highway driving: ‚ÄúThere are signs about this‚Äù (indicates that the participant pre-  Show information fers a sign instead of in-vehicle information) about dangerous roads/Straight highway driving: ‚ÄúWant to see in reality‚Äù (indicates that the participant prefers to see for him/herself rather than using in-car information)  3.3. A metaphor  When looking into the data the research team recognized a pattern. This pattern resulted in an easily understood metaphor, to be further developed and validated, for how the participants graded the functions and can be seen as a ‚Äúzoom lens‚Äù (See Fig. 3). Before, when planning the trip, the driver zooms out to make strategic decisions about the trip. In the parking area, the driver zooms into the closest

What is going on next to the car is not important. When the driver approaches an intersection, the tactical positioning is more important and the driver zooms in again but not to the closest proximity.  4. Discussion and conclusions  4.1. Discussion of  the results  The Ô¨Årst research question was whether drivers want or have a perceived need for different functions in different contexts (Q1), The interviews, function grading and open end answers in the study gave an indication that drivers have different perceived needs and desires in different driving contexts. A function, very important in one context, can be of no or little use in another context. An interview and a rating of abstract functions were carried out to investigate what information different drivers perceive to be needed and wanted in different contexts (Q2). The ratings gave a hint about what functions are needed or wanted and the standard deviation indicated to the extent to which there is consensus about each function (Q3). A CFM was created to illustrate the information needed in different contexts in a simple way for designers (Q4). The CFM can be utilized in the design of new context adaptive driver information interfaces. For instance, in queue driving, an explanation for why there is queue may be a way to solve the problem by perhaps giving re-routing information, while speed is of less importance. Drivers also want to be able to reduce the negative effects of queueing by for instance visual entertainment.  4.1.1. Information that different drivers perceived needed and wanted in different contexts  It is indicated that there are differences between different persons‚Äô opinions about what or who should provide the information for some of the functions. Should it be the car, the road authority or the driver him/herself? Some wanted for the most part to see for themselves and did not believe that a system could help them, and others preferred ‚Äúsystems‚Äù for almost everything. Perhaps different ways to enable these kinds of functions for a driver, ranging from option at purchase to a check box in the settings menu, can be an appropriate solution. This phenomenon may be illustrated by the function ‚Äúhelp to recognize other nearby vehicles‚Äù in the ‚Äúhighway crossing‚Äù context. The function received a high grade, a high variance and two par- the function in the waste bin (M ¬º 4.0, SD ¬º 1.1, ticipants put W ¬º 20%). It is likely that this function may help some, annoy some and even be found inappropriate by others. One explanation for this difference between participants may be found in the taxonomy for ‚Äúlocus of control‚Äù (Rotter, 1966). Locus of control is deÔ¨Åned as a personality attribute reÔ¨Çecting the degree to which a person generally perceives events to be under his or her own control (internal locus of control) or under the control of external forces (external locus of control). Research has shown that locus of control is one of the most crucial psychological factors determining drivers‚Äô acceptance of new in-vehicle technologies (Rudin-Brown and Noy, 2002). When designing context adaptive information systems, is it important also to have consensus about the contexts. In this study,  before and after driving were merged into one context. However, the results showed that the information wanted and needed before driving and after driving is sometimes completely different. This made it difÔ¨Åcult for the participants to give a grade that was equal for both before and after. Consequently, the participants used different strategies when they graded functions, such as ‚Äúaverage between the two‚Äù or ‚Äúa Ô¨Åve e if before‚Äù. This indicates that the context is ‚Äúweak‚Äù, and a split of the context may be suggested.  4.1.2. Usefulness of  the results  The usefulness of the outcome may be divided into two parts: the result in itself and the method. More available information and a higher demand on perfor- mance require, and Ô¨Çexible display technology enables, context adaptive driver information. The results can be used as a guideline for design of context adaptive driver information systems or for optimization of display space. For instance, functions that are perceived to be less important can be made less salient and those that are more important more salient in different contexts. The results, and in particular the grades, could possibly also be used as a weight when evaluating future adaptive information systems. For instance, a system that has a high score for the function ‚Äúshow speed‚Äù in a parking context still gets a weighted score that is low. In an adaptive driver information interface, when deciding how a function should be activated (automatically or manually) and if the design should be individualized, the system designer may look at the standard deviation. A large standard deviation can indicate low consensus about the function and, consequently, some of the drivers may be surprised or annoyed by receiving this information automatically. Furthermore, a large standard deviation may therefore also put forward that the design should be individualized. The method, changing the level of abstraction in both context and function, was an attempt to make participants think beyond the common functions and speciÔ¨Åc contexts that may be further developed and used in the development of, for instance, future In- Vehicle Information Systems (IVIS). Methodological considerations are further discussed below.  4.2. Methodological considerations  It was necessary to be somewhat creative in designing this study in terms of the balancing act between being too user centred and being too expert oriented. The following section considers the challenges and describes the solutions.  4.2.1. Data collection  A previous CWA was used to identify and formulate the functions in the interview. Normally, when performing a CWA, the designer of the system has to move outside the user community to get input for the design (Burns and Hajdukiewicz, 2004). The idea is to provide the user with a greater level of support than if the data collected came from users solely via, for instance, surveys, as in a User Centred Design (UCD) approach. In this study, the safety and HMI experts deÔ¨Åned the different physical functions and the different contexts, but real users were used to grade and give comments. The reason for this mixture was that real users may have more than rational reasons, wants,  
1000  S. Davidsson, H. Alm / Applied Ergonomics 45 (2014) 994e1002  perceived needs or desires, for ranking a function high or low, while experts are perhaps better at judging real needs. This dimension needs to be considered, since private cars are consumer products and pur- chase involves emotions that are not always rational.  4.2.2.  Simulation interview  To make the test participants better decision makers, it was important to support them in identifying central attributes, such as safety or environment friendliness (Wickens, 1992). Furthermore, it was important to make the participants think of what they do, how they do it, what they Ô¨Ånd difÔ¨Åcult and what their feelings are, to make the grading of the functions better.  4.2.3. Driving context  There are of course more possible contexts than the few that were chosen and, depending on the use of the results, other con- texts could have been included. This study‚Äôs contexts were decided by HMI and safety experts, and the contexts are thus possibly more important from a safety perspective. However, the pictures on the board were as unbiased as possible and did not show anything particularly problematic or hazardous. The reason for this was that the study was about the drivers‚Äô own experience. For instance, if a picture was shown of someone in an accident, the participants may have increased their acceptance for an accident avoiding system.  4.2.4.  Participants  As this was a Ô¨Årst study regarding context dependant informa- tion it was natural to start in Sweden. However, the between sub- jects design allow for other contexts and other regions.  4.2.5. Apparatus  The reasons for showing pictures, and showing them simulta- neously, were threefold: Ô¨Årst, in order to get a grading from a generic context rather than from one speciÔ¨Åc one, it was necessary to present several examples of the family of one context; second, we wanted to avoid serial position effects (e.g. Wickens, 1992) that may occur if the contexts are presented in sequence, such as in a movie; third, the pace at which a driving task is performed may be important. If the participant is presented a movie in which some- one else is driving, the pace could be different from the partici- pant‚Äôs own, and this may well have an effect on the result. There are indications that this worked as intended. The partic- ipants browsed the board and did not seem to favour any of the pictures. They discussed the whole sequence of the context, they mentioned events in their own experience that could be applied to the pictures and they discussed their own pace in similar situations.  4.2.6.  Function  An important challenge was how to illustrate the functions to reduce bias from well-known functions. An approach was needed that gave the less used, very new or more complex functions a reasonable chance. Shifting the representation from a low, detailed level (physical form) to a higher level of abstraction with less res- olution can make complexity look simpler. Put metaphorically, moving up one or two levels allows drivers to ‚Äúsee the forest for the trees‚Äù (Vicente, 1999). In addition, when creating a CAT, the abstraction is on the general function level (GF). However, this level seemed to be too abstract for the users to understand. It also seemed that the participants lost their ability to judge their ‚Äúwants‚Äù the more abstract the function became; they became experts. The trade-off between being too abstract to be understood, bias of well-known systems and how the CAT is usually carried out amounted to choosing the abstraction level, physical function (PF). Using the abstract level of physical function rather than physical function also seemed to have worked as intended,  form or general  but it is difÔ¨Åcult to see how well. One indicator was that, instead of just grading the function without much thought, the participants gave the impression of thinking twice before giving their grade and they moved sometimes up and sometimes down one level of abstraction, just as intended. A second indicator was that very common functions such as ‚Äúshow speed‚Äù showed great differences in how they were graded in the different contexts. Nevertheless, a more extensive comparison between the two ways of presenting the functions would be appropriate. One constraint when designing driver information is that some functions are mandatory from a legal perspective. In this study, however, participants were able to rate even ‚Äúlegally necessary‚Äù functions low.  4.2.7.  Statistical analysis  The participants were interviewed in only one or two contexts (between subjects design). The reason for this test design was threefold: Ô¨Årst, to keep the time spent on each interview within reasonable limits and, secondly, to be able to add contexts afterwards. Finally, the pilot study showed that participants, if interviewed in more than two contexts, also included the transition between the different contexts, which was not intended. The transition between two sets of information may be regarded as an automation challenge; this is discussed for instance by Davidsson (2009). The effect of the test design and the limited project resources resulted in a small number of participants in each context, which of course poses limitations to the statistical analysis when comparing the contexts.  4.2.8. Grading  A scale from 1 to 5 (1 ¬º not important, 5 ¬º very important) without a waste bin would not have worked since a function could be worse than ‚Äúnot important‚Äù. A function could also be not applicable, inappropriate or dangerous, and the waste bin was added for this reason. For instance, ‚Äúshow speed‚Äù may be consid- ered not to be applicable before driving and after driving and ‚Äúability to surf on the Internet‚Äù may be inappropriate and dangerous while driving in an intersection. As a consequence, the size of the population varied in almost every function, which makes it more difÔ¨Åcult to calculate different statistical measures. However, the statistics and the open ended answers may together give an answer about whether and how well a function suits a particular context.  4.2.9.  Reliability  The question ‚Äúshow average speed‚Äù was repeated (functions 14 and 77) to judge whether the participants were able to give a similar grade twice. The difference between the mean values is small with one exception: HC. However, this indicates that the re- spondents reason in much the same way. Details also reveal that only one participant had a greater difference than one grading step between the two questions in HC. The number of respondents was limited to ten persons in each context. To validate the methodology further, it is recommended that at least one context category be repeated with a greater number of participants.  4.3.  Final remark and conclusion  Driver Information that adapts to current vehicle status, situa- tional conditions and contextual prerequisites etcetera may be a future dream. This study aimed to get beyond drivers‚Äô current needs and describes a perhaps new approach to represent functions and contexts and a new way to grade functions. The study resulted in a context function matrix and a zoom metaphor useful for future  
S. Davidsson, H. Alm / Applied Ergonomics 45 (2014) 994e1002  1001  context adaptive driver information. The novel approach, limited number of participants, number of contexts and that the research only took place in one country implies that further research is needed.  Appendix

s0003687014000179,"  A review of the concepts, models, and tools related to humane product interaction and affective design allows different types of subjective impressions to be identiÔ¨Åed. Although the techniques of affective design are largely based on the principles of the Semantic Differential (Osgood et al., 1957), which analyzes the meanings given to the product, other proposals (Desmet, 2002) focus on the study of emotions (triggered within the individual and referring to her/him). Only a few proposals (such as Desmet and Hekkert, 2007; Crilly et al., 2004) consider and distinguish both concepts. Although they refer to different elements (product and individual, respec- tively), the meanings and emotions generated by a product prob- ably maintain some kind of relationship between them. Some authors (Desmet and Hekkert, 2007; Crilly et al., 2004) assume that the elicitation of emotions is subsequent to the generation of product meanings (and a consequence of it). Several types of meanings can be distinguished in a product, including aesthetics, functionality, symbolic values, etc., which  * Corresponding author. Tel.: √æ34 964728116; fax: √æ34 964728106.

Vergara).  have been given different denominations in the literature, such as product messages (Mon√∂, 1997), communicative functions (B√ºrdek, 1994) or roles of product appearance (Creusen and Schoormans, 2005). The aesthetic function is often considered as a separate aspect (Desmet and Hekkert, 2007) and not as a part of the se- mantic dimension (B√ºrdek, 1994). Other authors (Crilly et al., 2004) apply the denomination ‚Äúsemantic interpretation‚Äù only for what the product says about functionality performance, efÔ¨Åciency, and ergonomics. On the other hand, the semantic components are sometimes included in the aesthetic value of the product (Quarante, 1992). Regarding emotions, some authors (Norman, 2004; Jordan, 1998, 2000) relate affects (emotions are considered to be a type of affect) with the communicative functions mentioned above. There is no consensus on which emotions can be considered product emotions. Some sources distinguish between primary and secondary emotions, or use terms such as emotional features (Chakrabarti and Gupta, 2007), while others do not take into account these distinctions when it comes to selecting product emotions. The classiÔ¨Åcation proposed by Desmet (2003), based on the type of assessment that generates the emotion, is one of the most complete. The elicitation of meanings and emotions (from now on, subjec- tive impressions) is part of the process of communication between  0003-6870/$ e see front matter √ì 2014 Elsevier Ltd and The Ergonomics Society.

M.-J. Agost, M. Vergara / Applied Ergonomics 45 (2014) 1076e1086  1077  the individual and the product, and the senses are the starting point (Fenech and Borg, 2007) of this physical interaction. Moreover, this interaction may depend on the type of communication between the product and the individual. In this regard, some works have studied the inÔ¨Çuence of the intensity of the interaction, depending on the senses involved (Artacho-Ram√≠rez et al., 2008; Vergara et al., 2011) or on the type of interface (image, prototype.) used (Hwang et al., 2013; Sauer and Sonderegger, 2009). Then, after the objective sensorial part of the process has occurred, the subjective sphere comes into play. The information captured by the senses is analyzed, organized, and interpreted, thus enabling the association of mean- ings to the product, and the elicitation of emotions. These meanings and emotions will give rise to an assessment of the product, product preferences or, as some authors call it, behavioral responses. Thus, for an interested consumer, the behavioral response is called approach (purchase, use of the product, etc.), while for a disinterested one, the response is an avoidance or withdrawal of the product. But the preferences generated can also depend on the personal reference values. In the process of generating an assessment, a set of factors such as memory, previous experiences, culture, training, internal and learned rules, and also own emotional traits, can all play a part. In the literature all these personal values and criteria are denominated concerns (Desmet, 2002; Fenech and Borg, 2007), sociological values (Mantelet, 2006), or variables (Janhager, 2005). These per- sonal reference criteria are part of the human diversity that should be understood in order to add value in product design and use (Khalid, 2006). Accordingly, this human diversity should be taken into account in frameworks for affective design, since it affects in- dividual design needs (Khalid and Helander, 2004; Helander and Khalid, 2006; Khalid, 2006). Moreover, reference values should be considered as a possible inÔ¨Çuence on the relationship between meanings and emotions and product preferences: people‚Äôs emotional responses to products seem to vary between different generations, social groups, nationalities and cultures (Demirbilek and Sener, 2003). Cultural differences can even inÔ¨Çuence on the product attributes that trigger strong emotional responses (Seva and Helander, 2009). These elements of humaneproduct interaction (meanings, emotions, preferences, and reference values) and their relation- ships explained in previous paragraphs can be considered together in a model to understand the Subjective Impressions in Humane Product Interaction (SIHPI). The SIHPI model (Fig. 1) attempts to Ô¨Åll the gaps identiÔ¨Åed in previous partial models, taking from each one interesting aspects for the intended objectives. This model is widely explained elsewhere (Agost and Vergara, 2010). The SIHPI model can be used as a theoretical basis for the application of design tools that take into account subjective impressions elicited by the product in the different stages of the product lifecycle, specially design and development. Some methods are focused on the study of product design ele- ments and their relationship with affective aspects (like feelings, moods or emotions). The Kansei Engineering technique looks for translating customers‚Äô feelings into design elements (Nagamachi, 2002; Yang, 2011). These studies are very useful for designers to create products adapted to users‚Äô preferences in a speciÔ¨Åc moment. However, the relationship between speciÔ¨Åc design elements and product preferences can quickly change with trends, and also depending on the type of product, while the relationship between the subjective impressions elicited and product preferences may be more stable over time. Moreover, personal values have inÔ¨Çuence over this relationship. For instance: A trendy person will wear fashionable clothes, throughout her/his life. But the design ele- ments of these fashionable clothes, like colors in style, will vary according to trends. So, she/he will always prefer ‚Äúmodern‚Äù clothes,  but modern style will be associated to different design elements throughout her/his life: red color, Ô¨Åt style, and so on. In this work a study to analyze these relationships is described. Particularly, the analysis focuses on the relationship between product meanings and emotions, the relationship between both types of subjective impressions and product preferences, and the possible inÔ¨Çuence of personal reference values on the previous relationship. The products selected for the study were ceramic tile Ô¨Çoorings, whose designs are highly inÔ¨Çuenced by fashion, and consequently by subjective impressions. They are, as deÔ¨Åned by Seva et al. (2007), high-involvement products, that is, products that involve people in the purchasing process, are likely to elicit re- actions, are usually expensive, and express the purchaser‚Äôs personality.  2. Materials and methods  To analyze the relationships between the main elements of the SIHPI framework, an experiment with ceramic tile Ô¨Çoorings, based on questionnaires, was designed. A detailed description follows.  2.1.  Selection of  the subjects  283 adults participated in the study (158 male, 125 female). A website was implemented for the questionnaires, which were distributed to different types of customers or decision agents of ceramic design: actual or potential users of the product, architects, distributors, ceramic tile designers, etc. The link to the question- naire was distributed by e-mail to workers of the university, friends and acquaintances of the members of the research group, and to professional associations and enterprises of the ceramic sector. Several gifts were rafÔ¨Çed among the participants who Ô¨Ålled out the whole questionnaire to encourage participation.  2.2.  Selection of  the ceramic tile Ô¨Çoorings  A total of 19 ceramic tile Ô¨Çoorings were selected from recent catalogs. They were chosen to elicit very different subjective im- pressions and product preferences. 3D rendered images of a neutral room were used to show the different Ô¨Çoorings. As pointed out by previous authors (Alc√°ntara and Zamora, 2006), the Ô¨Çoorings used in the main parts of the house (living rooms, dining rooms or bedrooms) contain a greater emotional component than the Ô¨Çoorings for kitchens and bathrooms. Therefore, the elements of the room were chosen to be reminiscent of a neutral living room or bedroom. The images lacked any other decorative elements e except windows and doors e that could inÔ¨Çuence the subjective response. The format of the Ô¨Çoorings was superimposed onto the rendered image and shown in the lower left corner of each image (Fig. 2).  2.3. Description and selection of semantic, emotional, and reference value descriptors  To obtain the initial semantic and emotional universes, a comprehensive set of adjectives, nouns, and other words related to ceramic tile Ô¨Çoorings was compiled from ceramics companies‚Äô websites, catalogs, articles, and advertising in specialized journals, as well as words used in previous semantic studies and emotional tools (Lindberg, 2004; Alc√°ntara and Zamora, 2006, Desmet, 2002; Mantelet, 2006). The initial semantic universe obtained consisted of 179 words and the initial emotional universe consisted of 32 words/phrases. To achieve reduced semantic and emotional uni- verses, the afÔ¨Ånity diagrams technique (Dahan and Hauser, 2002) was applied by the authors. Some terms with very similar meaning  
1078  M.-J. Agost, M. Vergara / Applied Ergonomics 45 (2014) 1076e1086  Fig. 1. The SIHPI model.  were grouped. Some synonyms and antonyms were clustered using judgments like ‚ÄúIt is cozy and comfortable, not at all cold‚Äù. This was done to avoid different interpretations of each question and to reduce the number of questions. Antonyms were especially used in judgments related to product emotions, since these are character- ized by a bipolar affective nature (Russell, 1979; Fern√°ndez-Abascal, 1995). Adjectives related to sensory organs other than vision (the only sense used in the study) were also discarded (e.g. Light or It seems soft and silky). Professionals of the tile ceramic companies (marketing, com- mercial, design and development, management departments) reviewed the reduced universes obtained (both for semantics and emotions and also for personal reference values). The 24 semantic descriptors and the 7 pairs of emotional descriptors that were Ô¨Ånally used are shown in Tables 1 and 2, respectively. The de- scriptors used in the study were in Spanish. For the personal reference values, sources related to socio- logical values and personality factors were consulted (Rokeach, 1973; Eysenck and Eysenck, 1975; Digman, 1990; Goldberg, 1993), as well as catalogs and advertisements produced by the  Fig. 2.

The group of instrumental values (related to modes of behavior) was selected from the Rokearch approach, although some values have been discarded, and others have been grouped together into a single concept. In addition, a descriptor related to the ‚Äúsearch for new sensations‚Äù was added, since some articles pointed out the existence of differences between architects and non-architects when it comes to assessing buildings based spe- ciÔ¨Åcally on that factor (Llinares, 2003). The initial universe of reference values consisted of 37 descriptors. As in the previous cases, the universe was Ô¨Ånally achieved through descriptive judgments.  Table 1 Semantic descriptors.

I am very fond of them‚Äù was added to the collection, following the recommendation of the ceramic experts who acted as reviewers (Table 3).  2.4.  Procedure  The chosen (web) interface facilitated distribution and allowed us to gather the data in a centralized way. Texts in Spanish limited the scope of the study. The questionnaires were based on rating scales. First of all, some demographic characteristics and the personal reference values were gathered from participants. Then, they were shown the 19 Ô¨Çoorings. Each subject had to select two Ô¨Çoorings: the Ô¨Årst one that they would choose for home (or in their work, if they maintained a professional relationship with the product), and the Ô¨Årst one that they would reject. These two images were shown afterwards together with a third Ô¨Çooring (Fig. 3). The third one was the one with the lowest number of responses at that moment. It was chosen automatically with the aim of homogenizing the number of responses about the Ô¨Çoorings. The participants were asked to provide answers about the impressions elicited by each of from √æ2 the three Ô¨Çoorings using a rating scale with values to  2 (quite the opposite) (completely agree) in a randomized sequence for each impression. With the selection of the favorite/worst Ô¨Çoorings, we tried to ensure that the Ô¨Çoorings caused them strong subjective impres- sions. With the third Ô¨Çooring we tried to balance the number of answers of each Ô¨Çooring. Finally, they were asked to give their product assessment rating (with a score of 0e10) of the three Ô¨Çoorings (0 least valued, 10 most valued).  2.5. Analysis of results  All the statistical analyses were performed with the software application SPSS (PASW Statistics 18√ì). Four analyses were performed.

Analysis 1: structure of meanings, emotions, and personal reference values  In order to reduce the data to a structure that was easy to handle and understandable, three Factor Analyses (FA) were conducted. Principal Component Analysis with Varimax Rotation was used for the extraction of components. The ratings of the 24 semantic de- scriptors, 14 emotional descriptors (grouped in 7 pairs of antonyms), and 23 judgments about reference values were taken as independent variables. For the Ô¨Årst two analyses, 849 (283  3 images) cases were used, while for the last one 283 were used (1 per participant). The factors that were selected were the ones with eigenvalues above 1, either for the rotated components or for the original components prior to rotation; that is to say, the factors chosen were the ones considered to provide the best and most comprehensive structure in each case. The semantic and emotional structures were interpreted by taking into account the variables with signiÔ¨Åcant loads, according to the sample size (Hair et al., 2000).  2.5.2. Analysis 2: relationship between meanings and emotions  As only one factor was extracted for emotions, this relationship was performed by applying forward-step linear regression analysis. The emotional factor (EF) was considered as the dependent variable, and the semantic factors (SFs) were taken as the independent ones.  2.5.3. Analysis 3: relationship of meanings and emotions with product assessment  Analysis of correlations was applied to check the relationship of the SFs and EF (subjective impressions) with the product prefer- ences. Product Assessment (PA, the Ô¨Çooring rating from 0 to 10) was adopted as a representation of the product preferences.  
1080  M.-J. Agost, M. Vergara / Applied Ergonomics 45 (2014) 1076e1086  Fig. 3. Questions about the meanings and emotions elicited by the three Ô¨Çoorings.  Both Spearman‚Äôs and Pearson‚Äôs correlation coefÔ¨Åcients of the subjective impressions with the PA were initially used. Not all the variables used in this case followed a normal distribution, so the non-parametric correlation had to be used. However, as similar results were obtained, only Pearson‚Äôs coefÔ¨Åcients will be shown afterwards, as they are considered more powerful. Partial correla- tions coefÔ¨Åcients were also computed.  sampling adequacy (0.9 > 0.6), Bartlett‚Äôs test of sphericity was signiÔ¨Åcant (p < 0.001), and the total variance explained by the model was over 80%. The results of the rotated components of each factor can be seen in Table 4, although only components with a value above 0.3 are shown, according to the sample size (Hair et al., 2000). The nine SFs could be interpreted and named as follows:  2.5.4. Analysis 4: inÔ¨Çuence of the personal reference values on the relationship of meanings and emotions with product assessment  The next step was to analyze whether the relationship of meanings and emotions with product assessment could differ depending on the reference values of subjects. First of all, the reference value factors were transformed into binary coded variables to allow classifying participants in groups. For each factor, a cut-off value (corresponding to zero in the score of the original variables) was found, so as to be able to distinguish between the participants that are deÔ¨Åned as positive or negative in terms of the factor. Thus, from each factor, a new qualitative vari- able was created: VFgroup ¬º 0 (if the subject has been assessed below the cut-off value), and VFgroup ¬º 1 (if he/she has been assessed above that value). This cut-off point was calculated as the value of the factor for a neutral (0) value of all the original variables. In this way, groups of people can be distinguished according to their personal reference values. An analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed to verify that there were no signiÔ¨Åcant differences between the groups created by the new binary variables for the SFs, EF, and the PA, so that the groups were homogenous in terms of meanings, emotions, and global assessment. If this were not true, i.e., if there were signiÔ¨Åcant differences between groups for any of the variables, the differences observed in the relationship could be due to these differences and it would be a false result. Then, in order to analyze the inÔ¨Çuence of the reference values on the relationship of meanings and emotions with product assessment, correlations of semantic and emotional factors with the overall product assessment were repeated, but this time distinguishing between pop- ulation groups according to their personal reference values (VFgroup).  3. Results and discussion  3.1. Structure of the meanings, emotions, and personal reference values (analysis 1)  For meanings, nine semantic factors were extracted. As in- dicators of the goodness-of-Ô¨Åt of the analysis (Hair et al., 2000), the KaisereMeyereOlkin (KMO) measure was used to indicate the  like simple,  timeless and balanced,  SF1 Simple, versatile. This explains more than 24% of the variance and consists of adjectives which could be seen as symbolic values. It is also associated to functional values, with adjectives like versatile and functional. Simplicity of the Ô¨Çooring is associated with versatility and timelessness. So the most important semantic factor shows that simple Ô¨Çoorings will last for more time (people will not get tired of them). Moreover, simple Ô¨Çoorings will be more versatile (changes in decoration will not come into conÔ¨Çict with the Ô¨Çooring).  SF2 Innovative, designer Ô¨Çooring. This also explains a high per-  centage of the variance (>20%). It encompasses meanings again related to mainly symbolic names (in this case with innovation and avant-garde), and to aesthetic values, through adjectives  such as decorative or designer Ô¨Çooring.  SF3 Light. This is related to an aesthetic value: brightness and spaciousness, which is grouped with a perception of cheerful- ness. Hence, bright Ô¨Çoorings (those with nice, light colors) provide a greater feeling of spaciousness.  SF4 Resistant; SF5 Slippery; SF6 Easy to clean. The percentages of  variance explained are small (slightly more than 4% each one). These factors are related primarily to a single original variable, but these three factors are also clearly related to functionality and use.  SF7 Homely; SF8 Expensive-looking; SF9 Natural. Similar  to the three factors above, these are related primarily to a single original variable with a similar percentage of variance explained, although in this case the factors relate to symbolic values.  Only the Ô¨Årst three factors account for variance of several original variables while the other six factors (SF4, SF5, SF6, SF7, SF8, SF9) are related to only one original variable. This means that the six variables to which they relate are perceived almost indepen- dently, regardless of the rest of the questions in the questionnaire. In the Factorial Analysis of emotions, a single emotional factor identiÔ¨Åed (rotated eigenvalue ¬º 5.294) which can explain was 75.63% of the variance (Table 5). The KMO value (0.934 > 0.6) and the signiÔ¨Åcance level of the Bartlett‚Äôs test (p < 0.001) conÔ¨Årm the adequacy of implementing factorial analysis.

Relationship between meanings and emotions (Analysis 2)  Since the SFs are independent of each other and just one factor has been extracted for emotions in the previous analysis, linear regression was applied to analyze this relationship. The SFs are considered as the independent variables and the EF as the depen- dent one. The intention is to check to what extent the EF can be explained by the SFs. The results show that the nine SFs are included in the analysis, all of them contributing positively except contributes negatively. The total variance explained by the model is 81.3%. Table 7 summarizes the information about the coefÔ¨Åcients of the regression analysis for the Ô¨Ånal model obtained in the forward- step process. Three different groups of factors can be identiÔ¨Åed.

The results obtained show that there is a close relationship between the meanings given to the product and the emotions caused in the subject. However, emotions cannot be completely explained in terms of meanings: the nine factors included in the semantic analysis explain more than 80% of the variance of the EF. On the other hand, not all the meanings given to the product are related with the emotion in the same manner. In this experience,  certain meanings, such as SF1 Simple, versatile or SF2 Innovative,  designer Ô¨Çooring, present a greater relationship with the emotion generated by the product, while other meanings, such as SF6 Easy to clean or SF5 Slippery, do not show a relevant weight in the gener- ation of emotions (see Standardized coefÔ¨Åcients in Table 7). That is to say, the EF maintains a higher correlation with the SFs whose meanings are mainly symbolic or aesthetic, and is not (or is only very weakly e very low coefÔ¨Åcients-) related with the factors whose functions of meaning are associated with more functional issues.

The factors SF2 Innovative, designer Ô¨Çooring and SF3 Light are on a second level of correlation, and SF9 Natural, SF7 Homely and SF8 Expensive-looking are on a third, still signiÔ¨Åcant, level of correlation. Finally, the factors with functions of meaning that are essentially functional: SF4 Resistant, SF6 Easy to clean, and SF5 Slippery, are not signiÔ¨Åcant (Sig ¬º 0.01). In addition, the values of the coefÔ¨Åcients are very small (<0.1). Due to the relationship that exists between the SFs and the EF, an analysis of partial correlations of each factor with the PA was  Table 8 Pearson and partial correlation coefÔ¨Åcients between the PA and SFs, EF.

The only factor that has changed its position relative to the result obtained with total cor- relations is the EF, as expected. The rest of the factors (SFs) main- tained the relative order established in the previous correlation. However, in this case, the values of the coefÔ¨Åcients are higher for the last groups of semantic factors, i.e., the ones with a functional meaning. It has been seen that both product meanings and emotions can directly inÔ¨Çuence preferences. Even after removing the effect of the meanings in the relationship between emotion and assessment, this relationship does not disappear completely, but continues to maintain a very relevant position (the EF continues to be located in the Ô¨Årst group identiÔ¨Åed in relation to the PA, together with SF1e SF3). This means that the relationship between emotion and product assessment cannot be explained only on the basis of meanings. Emotion, regardless of them, has an inÔ¨Çuence on product assessment. In any case, not all meanings and emotions inÔ¨Çuence product assessment to the same extent. For the sample used in the study, the most inÔ¨Çuential semantic factors are linked primarily to sym- bolic and aesthetic meanings, while those related to functional meanings maintain low coefÔ¨Åcients, as was already seen in their relationship with the emotional factor. It should be noted that, in general, the relative importance of meanings on the product assessment does not vary, regardless of whether total or partial correlations are applied. This corroborates the assumption that the generation of meaning is prior to emotions (Desmet and Hekkert, 2007; Crilly et al., 2004), and that meanings are to a large extent responsible for the generation of emotions. Therefore, in the analysis of the relationship between meanings and product assessment, we could have used the simpler option: total correlations. In contrast, the relationship of emotion with product assessment should be analyzed with partial correlation or regression analysis because the relative inÔ¨Çuence of emotion with regard to the rest of the factors changes with the type of analysis.  3.4. InÔ¨Çuence of the personal reference values on the relationship of meanings and emotions with product assessment (Analysis 4)  The groups of total cases created with the reference values for the binary variable VFgroup2 Compliance and integrity were 843 for positive and 6 for negative. This number was considered very small, so that this variable was discarded in the analysis. For the rest of the variables, the distribution of cases ranged from 465 to 384 in the most homogeneous split to 771-78 in the least homogeneous. In these cases, the sizes of the groups provided enough power to detect small and medium-sized differences for mean values with an ANOVA, in line with Cohen (1992) (with a power of 80% and sig- niÔ¨Åcance level of 0.05). The exact power was calculated in accor- dance with Faul et al. (2007). In all, 110 ANOVAs were performed (10 independent variables VFgroup  11 dependent variables) to verify signiÔ¨Åcant differences between the groups created by the new binary variables for the SFs, the EF, and the PA. Only in nine of them the differences were sta- tistically signiÔ¨Åcant, in spite of the high level of power to Ô¨Ånd them. Thus, it may be concluded that the groups for these 10 reference values can be considered homogenous in terms of meanings, emotions, and global assessment and, if any change is observed in their relationship, it will be a real effect of the reference values of the subjects. Moreover, these nine differences could be due to the way the Ô¨Çoorings were chosen. It should be remembered that each participant selected two of the products to assess, and the third was assigned at random. So each group could have answered about different Ô¨Çoorings. For instance, Ô¨Çoorings number 1 and 5 (very  bright ones) have been often chosen as ‚Äúthe favorite Ô¨Çooring‚Äù (36.4% of the times) by participants who deÔ¨Åne themselves as neat and demanding (VFgroup6 ¬º 1). Nevertheless, they have been chosen only 13.4% of the times for the rest of the subjects (Fig. 4). Perhaps some differences would not have been detected if all participants had answered about the same Ô¨Çoorings. However, as stated before, the 10 pairs of groups can be considered homogenous in terms of meanings, emotions, and global assessment, in spite of the possible differences in the chosen Ô¨Çoorings. Once conÔ¨Årmed that the groups were homogeneous, the cor- relation coefÔ¨Åcients of SFs and EF with the global PA (previous re- sults) have been compared to the ones obtained when distinguishing groups of personal reference values (for VFgroup ¬º 1 and VFgroup ¬º 0). Fig. 5, below, shows the values of the correlation coefÔ¨Åcients of SFs and EF with the global PA, and also with the PA when distinguishing groups of personal reference values. For non- signiÔ¨Åcant correlations, the shading is omitted. The correlations obtained showed that the relationship between the semantic factor SF1 Simple, versatile and the PA is not altered by the distinction of groups based on the reference values. And the relationship between the EF and the PA also remains without changes. It should be noted that SF1 and EF are the factors that are most strongly related to the PA. On the other hand, the relationship between SF6 Easy to clean and the PA changes when distinguishing  the groups VFgroup 5, VFgroup 6, VFgroup 7, VFgroup 8, VFgroup 9,  VFgroup 4, VFgroup 5, VFgroup 9, and VFgroup 11. For instance,  VFgroup1 e Sophistication and fashion,  VFgroup 10, and VFgroup 11. Although general results show that SF6 do not maintain a signiÔ¨Åcant relation with the PA, those who consider themselves neat and demanding, practical, or those who look for safety, do relate easy to clean with the PA. Furthermore, the relationship between SF9 Natural and the PA changes when distinguishing the groups VFgroup 1, VFgroup 3, in- or PA  dividuals who consider themselves thoughtful, practical ecological people do not relate naturalness with the signiÔ¨Åcantly. From the groups created from the new variables, other inter- esting results can also be observed. As an example, in relation to the individuals that are deÔ¨Åned as interested in sophistication and fashion (VFgroup1 ¬º 1) show a higher correlation coefÔ¨Åcient between SF2 e Innovative, designer Ô¨Çooring and the PA (0.539) than the other group (0.292), although both are statistically signiÔ¨Åcant. Moreover, those who deÔ¨Åne themselves as sophisticated do not relate SF7 Homely and SF9 Natural with the PA, while the ones not deÔ¨Åned as sophisticated (VFgroup1 ¬º 0) do maintain a signiÔ¨Åcant correlation (Fig. 5). Other signiÔ¨Åcant changes are: those who do not consider themselves tolerant and optimistic people (VFgroup5 ¬º 0) relate easy to clean (SF6) with the PA, whereas the rest of the individuals do not. Individuals who deÔ¨Åne themselves as neat and demanding (VFgroup6 ¬º 1), and the ones who deÔ¨Åne themselves as practical (VFgroup9 ¬º 1) relate SF6 Easy to clean positively with the PA. This relationship is not signiÔ¨Åcant without distinguishing groups. On tionate or familiar (VFgroup10 ¬º 0) do not correlate SF7 with the the other hand, those who do not consider themselves as affec- PA, while in the general case this relationship is signiÔ¨Åcant, with a signiÔ¨Åcance level of 0.01. Therefore, it seems that some distinctions about the meanings that have the most inÔ¨Çuence on product preferences can some- times be identiÔ¨Åed, depending on the predominant reference values in each individual.  3.5. General discussion  The SIHPI model considers product meanings and emotions elicited (design for impressions). The analyses have shown that

M.-J. Agost, M. Vergara / Applied Ergonomics 45 (2014) 1076e1086  1085  meanings given to the product and emotions elicited are very close concepts; emotion can be explained on the basis of meanings to a large extent. In addition, they can both directly inÔ¨Çuence the product preferences. In this study, nine semantic factors belonging to the functional, aesthetic and symbolic Ô¨Åelds were extracted, which corresponds to the types of meanings, product messages (Mon√∂, 1997), roles (Creusen and Schoormans, 2005) or communicative functions (B√ºrdek, 1994) mentioned in the introduction. On the other hand, emotions have been identiÔ¨Åed as only one factor, which means that all emotions are almost the same, at least for this product and the emotions considered here. This Ô¨Åts the view of considering emo- tions as affects, with a (high or low) intensity and a (positive or negative) valence (Fern√°ndez-Abascal, 1995). Our results show that the emotional factor is only characterized by the scores (intensity) and their sign (valence). Not all the meanings are related to emotion with the same in- tensity. In our experience, functional SFs are not, or are only very weakly, related with EF. As we could expect, aesthetics and sym- bolic meanings are more related to the generation of product emotions. The emotional factor is strongly related to product assessment, although in the analysis of partial correlations this relationship is weaker, because emotion can largely be explained from the meanings. It has also been noted that both meanings and emotions are related to the product assessment, taken as a representation of the product preferences. In particular, it has been found that prefer- ences are related to a greater extent with semantic factors with symbolic or aesthetic functions. The emotional factor is strongly related to product assessment, although in the analysis of partial correlations this relationship is weaker, because emotion can largely be explained from the meanings. Furthermore, the SIHPI framework also considers personal values. Some distinctions in the meanings that most inÔ¨Çuence the product preferences are identiÔ¨Åed in some cases, depending on the predominant reference values in each individual. This could be an important result to better characterize target customers and mar- kets (or even other factors, like economic Ô¨Çuctuations), not only with demographic and sociological data, but also with personal and cultural values. For instance, some people who are more inÔ¨Çuenced by sophistication and fashion will be willing to pay higher prices for certain products that consider ‚Äòhigh-level‚Äô. In any case, the speciÔ¨Åc conditions of the study should be considered. The sample of product focuses on Ô¨Çoorings intended to the living room, with varied design features (colors, sizes, etc.). The Ô¨Çoorings have been represented through 3D images published in a web page. In addi- tion, other factors relevant to the decision (like the price) have not been taken into account. Future work could conÔ¨Årm whether (for instance), for kitchen or bathroom Ô¨Çoorings, functional meanings are more related to preferences or not. The study allows establishing the conditions to incorporate the customer as a collaboration agent in the ceramic tile product design and development (and also in other types of products, with similar characteristics: mature technology for production and designs that change continuously with fashion trends). A similar analysis should be performed for other types of Ô¨Çoorings, depending on the initial requirements established in the con- ceptual design phase (for instance: we are looking for a design for practical people; the product should seem functional, useful, natural , easy to clean, long-lasting.). First, subjective impres- sions that are closely related to the preferences of the target customers should be identiÔ¨Åed. Then, throughout the develop- ment process, designs should be checked, in order to conÔ¨Årm that they really elicit these intended subjective impressions on the target customers. The incorporation in the design process of early  revisions of affective requirements can increase the chance of success for products under development. Next step could consist on studying the relationship of speciÔ¨Åc design attributes of ceramic tile Ô¨Çoorings with subjective impres- sions and preferences. Nevertheless, as it was pointed before, this relationship is expected to be less stable over time.  4.  Conclusions  The theoretical models and tools for affective design proposed in the literature usually focus on the measurement of meanings given to the product or on the emotions generated. Both aspects have been considered jointly in this study. In addition, the reference values of the participants (personal criteria, rules, concerns, etc.) have been taken into account in the relationship of meanings and emotions with product preferences. A questionnaire was designed and distributed to different types of customers of ceramic tile Ô¨Çoorings via the web. Several factorial analyses applied to the responses showed that nine semantic fac- tors (Simple, versatile; Innovative, designer Ô¨Çooring; Light; Resis- tant; Slippery; Easy to clean; Homely; Expensive-looking; Natural), only one emotional factor, and eleven factors of reference values (Sophistication and fashion; Compliance and integrity; Thoughtful; Reserved; Tolerant, optimistic; Neat, demanding; Safety; Ceramic interest; Practice; Affectionate; Ecological) were perceived. Results from the study suggest that both meanings and emo- tions elicited by a product must be taken into account in the gen- eration of the product preferences. The meanings given to the product can cause the generation of emotions, and both types of subjective impressions give rise to product preferences. Besides, customers‚Äô personal values inÔ¨Çuence the relationship between subjective impressions and preferences. Thus, in the particular case of our experience, functional meanings become inÔ¨Çuential only for some customers‚Äô groups, based on their personal reference values. Knowledge about personal values of target customers, and about the meanings and emotions that really inÔ¨Çuence product prefer- ences, will make easier for designers to better adjust product design, reinforcing the chance of product success. These considerations can be helpful to ceramic tile design and development process, since they allow incorporating the customer as a key affective design agent from conceptual stage. Customers‚Äô subjective impressions and product preferences can be taken into account from the beginning, when only conceptual images or prototypes are developed.

s0003687014000192,"  1.1. Overview  From the perspective of healthcare providers, safe, usable, well- designed, medical equipment underpins quality of care. The prob- lem is, it is not always clear what constitutes ‚Äòwell designed‚Äô. There may be a lack of clarity regarding who the user is, what they need or how needs differ (Money et al., 2011). It can be hard for designers to step into the shoes of the patient or clinician when hospitals are extreme, protected, often closed, environments. The design of medical devices provides a challenge, in terms of representing the user and incorporating this into the product (Martin et al., 2008; Vincent et al., 2014). A variety of guidance is available (e.g. (AAMI, 2009; FDA, 2011; IEC, 2007; NPSA, 2010a, b; Sawyer, 2009)), but traditional forms of user representation may be challenged, given a broadening of application and generalisation of technology (e.g. generic products used by different types of individual such as anaesthetists and agency nurses).  * Corresponding author.

Taking infusion devices as an example, the variability between users can be great. Those controlling the pump may have minimal training (on how to use the pump), may be patients themselves, or may have extensive training and have undergone occupational selection. Similarly, there may be varying levels of procedure, process, monitoring or control associated with use. There are multiple and diverse interests that need representing during design. This paper is about the feasibility of deÔ¨Åning the charac- teristics of a typical user (as a step in a ‚Äúuser centred design‚Äù pro- cess) in this context.  1.2.  The origins of  the persona technique  Our aim was to understand how the use of one HCI/HF/Ergo- nomics technique (personas), adapts to support the development of a common class of medical equipment (infusion pumps). We as- sume a broad variation in the skills and background of users and devices that cater for multiple contexts (as described in Obradovich and Woods (1996)). Cooper outlines the use of personas in the context of software design as follows:  ‚ÄúA persona is a single, speciÔ¨Åc but representative, hypothetical user archetype based on a study of the user community. We distil the distinctive characteristics of that user community to just a few personas. We use them as tools to describe and articulate the  0003-6870/$ e see front matter √ì 2014 Elsevier Ltd and The Ergonomics Society.

The drawbacks of personas  (Cooper, 2000)  Personas include deÔ¨Ånitions of user goals; they describe what users want to accomplish and why. Typically, they are created during the design of consumer products and websites, and are described in papers and textbooks such as those of Cooper (2004; 2007), Pruitt and Adlin (2006) and Pruitt and Grudin (2003).  1.3.  The beneÔ¨Åts of using personas  system image (e.g. UI), and a user‚Äôs model  Personas can be employed to represent the user during design, without requiring that development teams gain Ô¨Årst hand experience of the environment of use. They support reasoning about the mental state of another (e.g. theory of mind (Pruitt and Grudin, 2003)). For example, User Interface (UI) designers need to provide a represen- tation of the system, which communicates function and status to users, without necessarily communicating the internal workings. Norman (1998) argues the need to support the match between the design model (e.g. conceptualisation that the designer has in mind), (e.g. conceptual under- standing developed to explain the operation of the system). Personas support this match and provide a way to help designers infer the user‚Äôs point of view (e.g. their goals, skills and needs). For UI design, personas have been shown to play a role in sup- porting organisation wide design input and communication amongst mixed teams (for a review of the beneÔ¨Åts see (Miaskiewicz and Kozar, 2011)). In theory, personas allow multidisciplinary teams to incorporate the needs of users together, at an early stage in the design (Nieters et al., 2007). Personas help designers focus on user goals (Pruitt and Grudin, 2003), and encourage extrospection and confrontation of unfamiliar design constraints (Noessel, 2012). They reduce the need to include users in design teams, and allow devel- opment personnel to work at a distance (Salmi et al., 2012). Personas can be used to support communication; create empathy amongst the design team; broaden focus; allow clariÔ¨Åcation of the position taken by a team-member and provide a linguistic approximation to the end user (Matthews et al., 2012). Personas help the articulation and resolution of design decisions in a context where design reasoning may be tacit. They provide a vehicle to make explicit the ‚Äúwhy are we building it like this?‚Äù Many of these beneÔ¨Åts can apply to safety critical contexts, for example as a way to Ô¨Åll gaps across multiple independent risk analysis activities (Bj√∂rndal et al., 2011). For Human Factors and Ergonomics practice, uses are diverse and varied, with personas being applied to support: the develop- ment of simulation and training systems in the automotive industry (Setia and Glyn, 2013); user requirements for car design/inclusive design (Marshall et al., 2014); the design of Personal Fall Arrest Systems (PFAS) (Liu et al., 2009); and the design of audit manage- ment systems for aircraft maintenance (Dharwada et al., 2007). This variation in application can be positive as it shows Ô¨Çexibility in adapting to various needs. For example, within healthcare personas have been useful for: making data anonymous (Jay et al., 2012); supporting inclusive design (Busch et al., 2013); and allowing for consideration of wider socio-technical or system-wide factors (HealthFoundation, 2012). The use of personas in an applied context has been well explored; however, there has been comparatively little research seeking to understand the inherent constraints and limitations of the technique, and challenges associated with constructing con- tent. This topic needs addressing in order to provide an under- standing of how researchers and practitioners can get the most out of the technique, and make sense of a mixed literature regarding the overall utility.  In domains outside medical equipment manufacture, research has identiÔ¨Åed several issues concerning the use of personas. For example, during industrial software design, personas are invoked less often than expected (Matthews et al., 2012). Researchers have questioned whether they substitute for the involvement of real users (Bodker et al., 2012). Designers may bypass personas, instead using an appeals based process based on their own opinions or stories relating to hypothetical interactions with a product (Friess, 2010). BeneÔ¨Åts are limited if the information contained within a persona conÔ¨Çicts with other statements of user need or provides false constraints on the design problem (Matthews et al., 2012). Even if content is correct and in agreement with other sources, there may be issues of trust. For example, student designers were shown to lack trust in a persona if they did not participate in the original user research themselves (Long, 2009). There is also the possibility that use becomes politicised or result in inÔ¨Åghting. For example, once a product is under development, there may be a resistance to deÔ¨Åning who the user is. Marketing and sales pro- fessionals may avoid adopting a user archetype when clients have already stated their priorities (Ronkko et al., 2004). Added to these concerns, the process for creating a persona may vary. The technique has been adapted, depending on what people want to accomplish and why. This occurs despite textbook de- scriptions (e.g. those that provide advice on the planning, creation, deployment, use and reuse of personas) being very clear. For example, textbooks such as (Adlin and Pruitt, 2010) support prac- tice by: breaking down the technique down into a staged process; illustrating typical content; and giving examples from practice (Cooper et al., 2007; Nielsen, 2013; Pruitt and Adlin, 2006). At one extreme, personas may be produced in seconds, as part of a cari- cature exercise during a design focus group. At another extreme, Pruitt and Grudin (2003) describe a persona exercise that lasted for 10 months and involved 22 people, to support the development of a Microsoft product. The differing types of output falling under the persona banner are so different that they cannot be fulÔ¨Ålling the same aim.  1.5.  The use of personas to support medical device design  Research is required, because: for medical devices, the appli- cation of personas is in its infancy (e.g. not referenced by standard practice such as (IEC, 2007)); in other domains there is scepticism about their value (Chapman and Milham, 2006); and their use to support the design of healthcare technology has received little attention (Lerouge et al., 2011). Although there is potential for personas to provide a broad representation of user requirements, there is a tension between the need to ‚Äúdesign for just one person‚Äù (Cooper, 2004), and standardised medical device practice (e.g. (Keay and Callander, 2004)), where equipment such as infusion pumps needs to adapt to suit the needs of many. During the design of medical technology, personas might be applied to prevent misunderstanding and/or encapsulate a broad range of user needs, but there is still much to be learnt about how this technique can be applied. We wanted to understand the practicalities of generating persona content for infusion devices, when the aim was to communicate multiple and varied needs that would not easily lend themselves to formal requirements (e.g. social factors). The aim was to test whether it was feasible to create personas to represent user needs. We were not aiming to design our own device or evaluate the use of personas in a development context, but to work through the process of generating representative persona content. No pre- vious studies have examined how personas can be constructed for

Our intent was to deliver the content to medical device developers, but our focus was on the process of creating personas and consulting with a variety of stakeholders (patient representa- tives, healthcare professionals and HCI/HF/Ergonomics in- vestigators), to learn about the feasibility of developing content. When creating the content, we did not work directly with in- dustrialists, due to concerns that we might inappropriately interact by (for example): creating conÔ¨Çicts of interest, compromising in- tellectual property, intervening in a way that conÔ¨Çicted with wider policy (e.g. ‚Äúharmonised‚Äù European design practice), or compro- mising a reputation for providing independent advice. We also wanted to avoid bias in our creation of content by (for example) endorsing a single product or using device speciÔ¨Åc terminology. We outline our experiences during the creation and checking of the personas in an academic/healthcare setting and reÔ¨Çect on the challenges.  2. "
s0003687014000209,"  In health literature, much focus is given to (reduction of) work demands, but the focus on its relation to work capacity is rather limited (Heerkens et al., 2004). Functional capacity (FC), which includes the total of all physical, cognitive and emotional charac- teristics of the worker (Dijk van et al., 1990), and work demands need to be in balance in order to regain or maintain working suc- cessfully (Heerkens et al., 2004). This can be achieved by either increasing capacity or decreasing workload by application of  Abbreviations:  FC, Functional Capacity; FCE, Functional Capacity Evaluation; WLA, Work Load Assessment; NV, Normative Values; DOT, Dictionary of Occupa- tional Titles; PWD, Physical Work Demands; METS, Metabolic Equivalent. * Corresponding author.

A previous study focused on in- terventions to reduce musculoskeletal complaints in the nursing profession and described strong effects of ergonomic interventions (Bos et al., 2006). FC can be measured with a Functional Capacity Evaluation (FCE). This is a battery of tests measuring the capacity to perform work-related activities (Soer et al., 2008). FCEs can be job- speciÔ¨Åc (Frings-Dresen and Sluiter, 2003), pathology-speciÔ¨Åc (Reneman et al., 2005; Gross et al., 2006) or can be used for the assessment of capacities for activities of daily living (Soer et al., 2009). Physical work demands (PWD) can be measured through standardized questionnaires or onsite measurement (van der Beek et al., 1992; Lindstrom et al., 1994). A disadvantage of question- naires used for PWD measurement, is ambiguity with respect to the validity. Because in practice, patients and healthy workers estimate their PWD considerably higher than can be objectiÔ¨Åed by onsite observations (van der Beek et al., 1992; Lindstrom et al., 1994), it is  0003-6870/$ e see front matter √ì 2014 Elsevier Ltd and The Ergonomics Society.

To deter- mine if a worker holds sufÔ¨Åcient FC to return to or stay at work, it is important that the FC of the worker is equal to or higher than the PWD (Dijk van et al., 1990). This comparison is important in determining whether increasing capacity of the worker or adap- tation of the workplace is needed. In the study of Kuijer et al. (2006), FCE activities derived from the Isernhagen Work Systems protocol were matched to the observed PWD in workers with chronic low back pain by video and real life observations (Kuijer et al., 2006). It was concluded that seven FCE activities could directly be matched with the PWD as measured through video observation on an onsite Work Load Assessment (WLA). These ac- tivities were carrying, pushing, pulling, crouching, kneeling, static forward bending, and dynamic bending and rotating. Lifting could indirectly be matched. Disadvantages of this method, however, are that WLA are time consuming and expensive and therefore prac- tically impossible to use for each worker or patient. Better knowledge concerning the relationship between PWD and FC enables practitioners to better advise with respect to return to or stay at work and develop better work rehabilitation programs or apply ergonomics principles more effectively. A more practical and inexpensive method to match FC and PWD is to compare FC with normative values (NVs) which were previously obtained (Soer et al., 2009). In that study, it was assumed that the FC expressed by NVs of healthy workers was sufÔ¨Åcient to meet the PWD (Soer et al., 2009), because all subjects were healthy and working in the year prior to the study. To interpret normative values validly, however, it is essential that these NV correspond to direct measurements of PWD for healthy subjects in a broad spectrum of occupations. When the normative values for the FCE are proven valid, FCE may serve as a screening instrument for potential imbalances and WLAs to measure PWD may be redundant, in cases where studying the physical part of the work capacity is needed. This study had two objectives. The Ô¨Årst objective was to deter- mine if functional capacity (determined by FCE) can be matched with PWD (measured by a WLA) in healthy working subjects. The second objective was to determine the valid cut-off percentile of the NVs of FCE for healthy workers in jobs with different levels of physical work demands.  2. "
s0003687014000349,"  In-vehicle information systems (IVIS) and other electronic de- vices than can be used while driving have seen an immense in- crease in popularity in recent years (Janitzek et al., 2010), and their prevalence is expected to grow even further (Buettner, 2009). The operation of such systems requires manual, visual, cognitive and auditory resources to varying degrees. The quantiÔ¨Åcation of this resource demand is a vital aspect of IVIS interface design. Conse- quently, the assessment of their potential to distract drivers has become an important issue. Several easy-to-use methods have been developed to investigate the level of distraction associated with IVIS use already in the early stages of product development. One of these tools is the Lane Change Task (LCT; Mattes, 2003). The LCT is a simple and inexpensive dual task method which is speciÔ¨Åed by an ISO standard (ISO/DIS 26022, 2010). The task employs the look and feel of a simple driving simula- tion, which mainly consists of a three-lane road, with no other  * Corresponding author.

Participants are required to control a simulated vehicle and change lanes ac- cording to the information on the signs while maintaining a con- stant speed of 60 km/h which cannot be exceeded. The signs appear around every 150 m; time between lane changes is around 9 s. Recommended performance measure is the mean deviation (MDEV) from an ideal lane keeping and changing trajectory that is based on the participants‚Äô own baseline drive, which is called the adaptive model. Optional is the calculation of an MDEV value based on a normative lane change model (basic model), which is the same for all participants. One of the task‚Äôs assets is the fact that it bears some obvious similarities to real world driving (while researchers are, of course, quick to point out that the LCT is not really a driving task, e.g. Mattes and Hall√©n, 2009). The LCT ISO standard states that the task is supposed to ‚Äúcontain elements important to the driving task‚Äù, namely ‚Äúcourse following and maneuvering‚Äù and ‚Äúevent detection‚Äù (p. 21). In terms of safety relevance, especially the inclusion of event detection seems crucial. Victor et al.

As Sheridan (2004) points out, ‚Äúwhether a particular distraction actually diminishes safety to any measurable extent clearly de- pends [.] on unexpected events that occur when attention is not on driving.‚Äù (p. 593). Numerous studies have shown that different forms of distraction can impact negatively on event detection. In their meta-analysis of effects of cell phone use on driver performance, Caird et al. (2008) found that amongst various vari- ables, reaction time to events and stimuli was affected most. Such events can be suddenly braking lead vehicles (e.g. Alm and Nilsson, 1995; Lamble et al., 1999a), a pedestrian stepping onto the driver‚Äôs lane (Laberge et al., 2004) or changing trafÔ¨Åc signals (Hancock et al., 2003). Others have used artiÔ¨Åcial tasks like the peripheral detection task (PDT, now detection response task, DRT; e.g. Patten et al., 2004) to present stimuli to the driver that require a response (usually a button press). But cell phone usage is far from being the only secondary task that has an effect on event detection. Speech based e-mail systems (Lee et al., 2001), visually demanding in-car tasks (Lamble et al., 1999b) and even climate control adjustment (Greenberg et al., 2003) were found to have an inÔ¨Çuence on event detection metrics. Given the profound effects distraction has on the detection of events and the driver‚Äôs response to them, including elements of event detection in a task that is supposed to assess the effects of driver distraction is fairly reasonable. But are the events and the way they are presented in the LCT really safety relevant? The event detection element that the ISO standard refers to is the perception of and proper response to the lane change signs. While those signs are not evenly spaced, the standard states that ‚Äúthe mean distance from sign to sign is 150 m (a minimum of 140 m plus an expo- nentially distributed random variable with a mean of 10 m)‚Äù (p. 7). In practice, that means that none of the distances is shorter than 140 m, and that in more than 85% of all cases, the distance from sign to sign is between 140 and 160 m. Lane change intervals are be- tween 8.4 and 11.4 s (Mattes and Hall√©n, 2009). Therefore, after passing a sign, participants can allocate at least 8 s to the secondary task without risk to miss the next one, and can be pretty sure this next one will appear not much later than 9e10 s after the previous. Even more problematic is the fact that ‚Äúthe lane change signs are always visible‚Äù, although they remain ‚Äúblank until the lane in- dications on the signs appear (i.e., pop up) at a distance of 40 m before the signs‚Äù (p.7). So, the position of the event to detect is known well in advance, just as when the event will occur. Conse- quently, others have found before that the LCT runs into problems when it is supposed to assess secondary tasks that allow for ‚Äútactical‚Äù behaviour, i.e. timing secondary task operation according to the occurrence of lane change signs (Bengler et al., 2010; Petzoldt et al., 2011). The term ‚Äútemporal uncertainty‚Äù, ascribed to Hick (1952) and Hyman (1953), is used to describe this aspect of response selection (usually summarised under the label ‚ÄúHick‚Äôs law‚Äù or ‚ÄúHick-Hyman law‚Äù), which is ‚Äúthe degree of predictability of when the stimulus will occur‚Äù (Wickens and Hollands, 2000). If temporal uncertainty is low, reaction times are short. It appears that the LCT with its relatively regular, easily predictable events is hardly a reÔ¨Çection of a suddenly braking lead vehicle, much less a pedestrian stepping onto the street unexpectedly. However, the issues go even beyond the detection of events. Once an unexpected event is detected, a driver usually has to decide among a set of different behavioural options to respond. Depending on the distance to the hazard, he might brake, accelerate, steer to the left or right, or combine some of these manoeuvres. While this is still a fairly constrained response set, it is certainly richer in options than the LCT. Even without consideration of other context factors (Is the adjacent lane empty? Does the height of the kerb allow for a swerve to the right? etc.), a certain amount of processing  is required to select an appropriate response. In the LCT, for two out of three possible lane positions (left and right), no information processing or decision making is required to initiate a response. When travelling in one of the outer lanes, the only behavioural option when arriving at a lane change sign is to steer towards the other side of the road. As Boff and Lincoln (1988) highlight, response time is affected by the ‚Äúuncertainty about which stimulus will appear and/or which response will be required‚Äù (p. 1860). The signs might give information on how far to travel across (either the centre or the other outer lane), but initially, there is only one valid motor response, which is known before. As soon as the information pops up on the sign (or even before e however, participants are instructed ‚Äúto begin a lane change as soon as the symbols appear on a sign, but not before‚Äù, ISO/DIS 26022, 2010, p. 17), participants can begin to steer. Processing of the information presented on the sign can be done while steering. Some researchers have already tried to avoid that issue, e.g. by introducing an unlimited number of lanes on their track, so that every time a lane change is required, it could be either to the left or the right (Hofmann and Rinkenauer, 2013). Although not directly an element of event detection, the fact that responses can be selected without or before processing information is another indicator for a certain disparity between actual safety critical events while driving and events as deÔ¨Åned in the LCT. Given the aforementioned issues, it is at least debatable if the LCT is an event detection task that is really reÔ¨Çecting the detection of safety relevant events in real world driving. But what could be expected if LCT events were less predictable? How would results look like if signs were not visible all the time, and if the information had to be processed before a manoeuvre could be selected? It is reasonable to assume that as a result of lower predictability, per- formance would overall degrade (Green, 2000). That in itself is not a problem for the LCT e a simple, unspeciÔ¨Åc degradation of per- formance would not change the overall pattern of results and hence not change the conclusions drawn. But could the pattern of results when assessing different secondary tasks change as a consequence of increased unpredictability? With regard to an increased difÔ¨Åculty in the detection of an event, there is no clear picture to allow for a speciÔ¨Åc hypothesis. There are reports of cognitive distraction having a stronger effect on performance in simple event detection tasks (decelerating/braking in response to a slowing down/braking lead vehicle) than visual distraction (Jamson and Merat, 2005), just as there are reports of exactly the opposite (Liang and Lee, 2010). In a driving simulator study, Muhrer and Vollrath (2011) found that visual distraction negatively impacted on the perception of sudden events, however also went with compensatory behaviour (increase in distance to lead vehicle, decrease in speed), whereas under cognitive distrac- tion, participants did not compensate. This suggests that the negative effects of visual distraction might be underestimated un- der the current LCT regime, which requires the perception of (and reaction to) rather predictable events which allow for compensa- tory strategies. With increased difÔ¨Åculty in response selection, cognitive distraction could be expected to have a stronger impact on LCT performance. Engstrom and Markkula (2007) reported on an LCT experiment in which they employed visual and cognitive secondary tasks. Their analysis showed that only with a concurrent cognitive task, there were several instances of erroneous responses in which participants performed a lane change to the wrong target lane. They concluded that the cause was either recognition or response selection failure. Choice reaction time, of which response selection is a central element, has a long history as a measure reÔ¨Çecting the processing of information (e.g. Merkel, 1885). It is reasonable to assume that once information has been perceived (which has to be the case in order to select a response), visual resources play a  
1220  T. Petzoldt,  J.F. Krems / Applied Ergonomics 45 (2014) 1218e1224  secondary role at best, whereas cognitive resources are required to facilitate the decision on an appropriate response. To investigate which consequences a reduced predictability of lane changes has on lane change performance, we created our own implementation of the LCT, to then manipulate relevant features of the task. We created our Ô¨Årst version of the LCT according to ISO recommendations, and tried to reduce the predictability of lane change events in our second version. In the third version, we kept the reduced predictability of the events, and reduced the predict- ability of the required response in addition. We conducted three different experiments, all of which had exactly the same setup, the sole exception being the way the LCT was implemented. Conse- quently, in the analysis presented in this article, we treat the three experiments as three conditions in a between subjects design. However, we want to emphasise that the experiments were con- ducted one after the other, and not in parallel. The results of Experiment I were important for us to understand whether our implementation of the LCT worked or not, before we could proceed with any other experiment. Findings from Experiment II were taken into consideration when designing the LCT implementation for Experiment III.  2. Method  2.1.  Participants  Seventy-two students of TU Chemnitz took part in our three experiments. Three datasets had to be excluded from the analysis for being statistical outliers. Forty-three of the remaining 69 par- ticipants were female, 26 male, with a mean age of 22.7 years (SD ¬º 3.1). All possessed a valid driving licence. Once they had taken part in one of the experiments, they were not allowed to participate in another one.  2.2. Material  2.2.1.  LCT  We implemented the LCT with the STISIM driving simulation environment (see Fig. 1). This allowed us to manipulate the relevant environmental variables to create a higher level of unpredictability.  2.2.1.1.  Experiment I.  For Experiment I (classical LCT, conforming to ISO), we closely followed the ISO LCT guidelines (ISO/DIS 26022, 2010). We used the well known lane change signs, had them  Fig. 1.  Lane change task (LCT); example screen.  visible permanently with the lane change information popping up 40 m before passing the sign, and put them at the same positions as in Mattes‚Äô (2003) LCT implementation, with distances between two signs of about 150 m (SD ¬º 9.6 m; range 140.05e188 m).  2.2.1.2.  II.  Experiment  In Experiment II (sign position less predict- able), we changed sign visibility and sign positions to make event detection more difÔ¨Åcult. We completely removed the blank signs from the simulation. Instead, the whole sign (including the infor- mation) would only become visible 40 m in advance. A similar setup is mentioned by Mattes and Hall√©n (2009) as part of the ADAM project, however, no results of such an investigation seem to have been published. We also introduced a higher variation of sign positions compared to the ISO recommendation. Distances be- much wider, random distribution (SD ¬º 33.7 m; range 73e219 m), tween two signs were still 150 m on average, however now with a which resulted in intervals of 4.4 up to 13.1 s between lane changes.  2.2.1.3.  Experiment III.  In Experiment III (sign position √æ sign con- tent less predictable), we wanted to keep event detection as difÔ¨Å- cult as possible (i.e. we kept the changes made in Experiment II) and add an element of uncertainty regarding the response that was required, to make the task a true event detection and response selection task. To accomplish this, we added signs that did not require any action on behalf of the driver. We placed signs that indicate the change to a speciÔ¨Åc lane at positions at which the driver should already be travelling on the required lane, i.e. two consecutive signs pointed to the same lane (Mattes and Hall√©n, 2009; use the term ‚Äúcatch trial‚Äù). Overall, we added six signs (two for each lane) that did not require a response to the eighteen that were already part of the track. Positions of the signs that did require a lane change remained the same as in Experiment II, so the normative lane change paths are identical. The LCT was presented on a 2300 Ô¨Çat screen. The vehicle was controlled with a MOMO force-feedback game steering wheel with foot pedals. The length of a single LCT trial corresponded to the length of one LCT track (1800 m) which took roughly 3 min, pro- vided the participants followed instructions. As performance measures, we calculated both the mean deviation (MDEV) from a normative lane change path and the MDEV from an adaptive lane change model based on a participants baseline drive, as well as lane change initiation (ISO/DIS 26022, 2010).  2.2.2.  Secondary tasks  For the secondary tasks, we decided to use a cognitive and a visual task, each of them in an easy and a difÔ¨Åcult version. We closely followed the example of Mattes and Hall√©n (2009) in the selection of the tasks and the levels of difÔ¨Åculty. In the easy cognitive task, participants had to count forwards in steps of two from 212 on. In the difÔ¨Åcult version, the task was to count backwards in steps of 7 from 581 on. Participants were told to keep a constant pace while counting, however without speciÔ¨Åc instruction on the actual pace. The visual task we employed was the so-called surrogate reference task (SuRT), which required participants to scan stimulus displays for the one stimulus that differed from others surrounding it. Target and distracters were white circles in front of a black background. Participants responded by moving a vertical grey in- dicator bar to the position of the identiÔ¨Åed target and pressing the enter key for conÔ¨Årmation, followed by the next display. For the visual easy condition, distracters were 4 mm in diameter (visual angle approx. .46 ), the target was 8 mm (visual angle approx. .92 ), with only two indicator bar sections. In the visual difÔ¨Åcult condi- .80 ), tion, distracters were 7 mm in diameter (visual angle approx. .92 ), with eight the target was again 8 mm (visual angle approx.

The indicator bar was controlled by using a standard keyboard. Position of screen and keyboard matched the requirements of the LCT ISO.  2.3.  Procedure  The procedure was identical for all experiments. Following ISO recommendations, participants practiced LCT driving until they achieved an MDEV <1.2 using the basic lane change model. Then, they completed one baseline trial (LCT as a single task). The different secondary task conditions (blocked for task type, random for difÔ¨Åculty within task type, order balanced over par- ticipants) were explained and practiced as single tasks until participants felt comfortable (usually rather short), followed by one practice trial with both tasks in parallel , before one mea- surement trial was completed. At the end, participants completed a second LCT baseline trial. The experimental session took about 30 min. Overall data collection was spread over a period of six months, with around three weeks of data collection for each of the experiments.  3. Results  As one of our objectives was to assess whether the lowered predictability has an effect on LCT performance at all, we Ô¨Årst analysed performance using the basic lane change model. In the basic model, drivers‚Äô lane keeping and changing trajectories are compared against a normative trajectory that is the same for all participants. Delayed responses to lane change signs would result in larger deviations from this normative trajectory, and would therefore be directly reÔ¨Çected in the performance measure. As Fig. 2 shows, performance decreased as expected as a function of lowered predictability, however without any clear changes in the overall pattern of results. We calculated a two-way ANOVA for mixed de- signs and found a signiÔ¨Åcant difference between the six task con- ditions, F(5, 330) ¬º 110.47, p < .001, hp 2 ¬º .626. More importantly, we found a main effect of predictability, F(2, 66) ¬º 9.67, p < .001, 2 ¬º .227. Post-hoc comparisons (Bonferroni-corrected for multi- ple comparisons) showed signiÔ¨Åcant differences between the original LCT implementation and the two less predictable ones (p ¬º .027 and p < .001), whereas there was no difference between the two manipulated versions (p ¬º .356). There was no interaction between secondary task type and predictability.  hp  hp  We also investigated the difference between the different sec- ondary task conditions and baseline performance, since in the assessment of the distraction potential of a certain task or system, the comparison to non-distracted performance is often of interest. To do that, we calculated the mean of the two baseline conditions, to then calculate the difference between performance in each dual task condition and the averaged baseline performance. It appears that the difference increased with growing unpredictability (Fig. 3). The ANOVA showed a signiÔ¨Åcant difference between the secondary task conditions, F(3, 198) ¬º 76.47, p < .001, hp 2 ¬º .537, and also between the three levels of predictability, F(2, 66) ¬º 3.92, p ¬º .025, 2 ¬º .106. Post-hoc comparisons (Bonferroni-corrected for multi- ple comparisons) uncovered a signiÔ¨Åcant difference between the original LCT implementation and the condition in which sign po- sition and content were less predictable (p ¬º .020), whereas there was no difference between the unpredictable sign condition and the other two (p ¬º .580 and p ¬º .466). In a second step, we analysed performance using the adaptive lane change model, which is the method recommend by the ISO standard (the basic model is described as ‚Äúoptional‚Äù). Here, the trajectory against which performance is tested is created using a participants own baseline drive. This method can serve to minimise inter-individual differences in recorded performance. Whereas in the basic model a slow responder would produce overall high MDEV values because his slow responding creates generally large differences to the normative trajectory, the adaptive model ac- counts for that, as the trajectory against which is tested would expect a later response to the sign from this particular participant. So, if a higher unpredictability of the lane change signs would result in an unspeciÔ¨Åc delay in lane change initiation across all conditions (including the baselines) the adaptive method would practically Ô¨Ålter that effect out. As can be seen in Fig. 4, this appears to be more or less the case. Although a minor decrease in performance seems to occur, the differences are hardly substantial. The ANOVA conÔ¨Årmed this impression, with no signiÔ¨Åcant effect of predictability, F(2, 66) ¬º .46, p ¬º .637, hp 2 ¬º .014. Task condition again had a signiÔ¨Åcant inÔ¨Çuence on performance, F(5, 330) ¬º 77.99, p < .001, hp 2 ¬º .542. There was no interaction between predictability and task condition. We also assessed lane change initiation directly. This was done by identifying local minima/maxima of steering wheel angle pre- ceding a lane change. The delay in lane change initiation was then calculated as the time difference between that local minimum/ maximum and the appearance of the lane change sign. As displayed  Fig. 2.

Secondary task performance (as number of secondary task trials completed) in the different experimental conditions (error bars indicate standard error).  in Fig. 5, predictability had the expected effect on lane change initiation delay, which was conÔ¨Årmed by the statistical analysis, F(2, 66) ¬º 43.13, p < .001, hp 2 ¬º .568. Post-hoc comparisons (Bonferroni- corrected for multiple comparisons) uncovered signiÔ¨Åcant differ- ences between all three LCT implementations (p < .001 for ISO p ¬º .023 version vs. both less predictable implementations, for comparison between the two less predictable versions). Task condition also impacted signiÔ¨Åcantly on performance, F(5, 330) ¬º 159.95, p < .001, hp 2 ¬º .708. In addition, we found a sig- niÔ¨Åcant interaction between predictability and task condition, F(6, 330) ¬º 4.60, p < .001, hp 2 ¬º .122. It appears that while the decre- ment in performance as a result of lowered predictability is clearly visible throughout, it seems to be especially pronounced in the two visual conditions, where the difference between performance with any of the two less predictable versions and the ISO conforming one is higher than for other task conditions. Finally, we analysed performance in the secondary tasks (see Fig. 6). Performance in the visual task was measured as the number of SuRT trials Ô¨Ånished. For the cognitive task, the number of counts made during the run of a trial was used as a performance measure. Accuracy (correctly identiÔ¨Åed target stimuli in the SuRT, correct counts in the cognitive task) was high throughout (group means between 88% for SuRT difÔ¨Åcult with ISO LCT and 100% for SuRT easy  Fig. 5. Delay in lane change initiation for the three LCT implementations (error bars indicate standard error).  hp  with position unpredictable LCT), so it can be assumed that par- ticipants devoted sufÔ¨Åcient attentional resources to the operation of secondary tasks. As would have been expected, task condition had a major inÔ¨Çuence on performance, F(3, 198) ¬º 570.54, p < .001, 2 ¬º .896. Predictability, in contrast, had no main effect, F(2, 66) ¬º 3.08, p ¬º .053, hp 2 ¬º .085. However, we found a signiÔ¨Åcant interaction between task condition and predictability, F(6, 198) ¬º 4.42, p < .001, hp 2 ¬º .118. It appears that the group that was tested on the LCT with reduced predictability of the sign position completed more secondary task trials across all conditions compared to the group that was tested on the ISO conforming implementation. The group for which both sign position and con- tent were less predictable completed fewer secondary task trials than the other two in three of the four conditions. In the cognitive easy condition, however, this group completed a considerable number of trials more than the group that was tested on the ISO conforming implementation.  4. Discussion  Goal of our experiments was to investigate which effects a decrease in predictability of lane changes in the Lane Change Task (LCT) would have on LCT performance with different con- current tasks. The results showed that when performance was calculated as the deviation from a normative lane change tra- jectory, a decrease in predictability lead to degradations in per- formance. This effect was stronger for the LCT that included both lowered predictability of sign position and required response compared to the LCT in which only sign positions were less predictable. The analysis of lane change initiation delay provided similar results. This is hardly surprising. Green (2000) noted that ‚Äútime increases with [.] uncertainty (signal location, time or form), and surprise‚Äù, just as ‚Äúresponse selection slows under choice RT when there are multiple possible responses‚Äù (p. 200). However, none of the changes to the LCT seemed to produce speciÔ¨Åc effects in certain dual task combinations. LCT perfor- mance in cognitive and visual, easy and difÔ¨Åcult dual task situ- ations suffered equally. And when the adaptive MDEV, the recommended performance measure, was calculated, even the main effect of predictability disappeared. Despite the reasonable expectation that a higher temporal uncertainty or a decreased predictability of the required response might affect different dual task combinations in a different way, differences between the dual task combinations remained surprisingly stable.  
T. Petzoldt,  J.F. Krems / Applied Ergonomics 45 (2014) 1218e1224  1223  The only change in the pattern of results that was observed was a growing difference between performance in dual task conditions and the baseline conditions. This might be an issue when inferences are drawn from a direct comparison of dual task conditions with baseline driving, especially when no or only small differences be- tween baseline and dual task performance are found. Minin et al. (2012) reported on an experiment with six experimental condi- tions, including two single task and four dual task trials. Based on the results of their analysis, they discussed why the basic lane change model was not able to capture performance degradation on the primary task (although they failed to report descriptive statis- tics on that fact). Mitsopoulos-Rubens et al. (2010) described ex- periments from which they concluded that the LCT was overall effective in assessing distraction however also discussed why LCT performance was not always signiÔ¨Åcantly affected by cognitive distraction. Considering our results, one might wonder if the same non-effects would have occurred if the LCT would have been less predictable. One reason why the LCT is appealing as a tool is that although the simulation-like look gives the impression of real-world driving, it is an extremely simple task. We did not want to create a task that is much more complex, but rather tried to stay as close as possible to the original one, only introducing minor changes that would not alter its underlying nature. Our aim was to meddle only as little as possible with the ISO standard. However, it certainly would be possible to push the task further, to make lane changes even less predictable and response selection even more difÔ¨Åcult. An example of that would be the integration of a more demanding choice re- action task. Instead of requiring only the processing of one single aspect of information (the lane indicated on the lane change sign), a combination of information might have to be assessed in order to select an appropriate response. One simple variant might be to introduce colour as an additional layer of information on the signs. The combination of a certain sign with a certain colour might have a speciÔ¨Åc meaning, the combination with a different colour another one. Given the complexity of many driving situations, and given the fact that especially in such complex situations driver distraction appears to produce the largest effects (e.g. Jamson and Merat, 2005), it would be highly interesting to see if results would still be comparable to our Ô¨Åndings. Overall, the results of the experiments reported in this paper support the validity of the LCT. Despite the fact that the ISO stan- dard‚Äôs claim that the LCT has elements of an event detection task is questionable (especially when thinking not only of events, but safety relevant events), a lower level of event predictability did not produce fundamentally different results. Although LCT re- quirements were manipulated, the patterns of results obtained with the different LCT implementations were strikingly similar. The ISO conforming version of the task would have come to the same conclusions about the secondary tasks as the less predictable ones. Still, from a theoretical point of view, a lower predictability of lane changes is certainly of higher external validity than the current ISO recommendation. In future revisions of the standard, this might be an aspect that should be considered, given especially its ease of implementation. In general, the question of external validity is worth asking, not only regarding the requirements of the task, but also regarding the measures that are obtained. Is it realistic to assume that real world drivers aim for ‚Äúperfect‚Äù lateral control (i.e. no variance at all), or does good performance in a regular trafÔ¨Åc environment just mean ‚Äúsafe‚Äù lane keeping within certain boundaries? Usually, it is fairly easy to come up with examples of bad performance (i.e. crossing the lane boundaries), whereas non-safety critical performance, or different levels thereof are often not straightforward to deÔ¨Åne. Consequently, absolute criteria for what is acceptable and what is  not do not exist. However, this is not necessarily a shortcoming of this speciÔ¨Åc assessment method. Rather, it appears that the corre- lation between surrogate measures of safety and actual safety is not perfect, and as of now, only partially understood. In the assessment of driver distraction, however, there is a clear need for absolute criteria to compare against. The current practice of using perfor- mance while engaged in an acceptable secondary task (e.g. tuning the radio) as a surrogate for such a threshold is far from being satisfactory. The development of valid thresholds seems to be an important next step, not only for the LCT, but for most measures of driver distraction. But, it appears that even a deÔ¨Ånition of driver distraction and a clear statement on its consequences for real world driving are difÔ¨Åcult (Regan et al., 2011). So, the ‚Äúreality‚Äù against which simple methods have to be compared is only poorly deÔ¨Åned. But only when there is a full, integrated picture of what the driving task is, and how a potential source of distraction is expected to disrupt that task, can deÔ¨Ånitive statements about the (in)validity of simple assessment methods of driver distraction be made.
